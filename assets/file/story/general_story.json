      "body": "Before several centuries, there was a very large, dense and dark forest. A group of monkeys arrived at the forest. It was winter season, and the monkeys struggled hard to survive the freezing cold nights. They were hunting for fire to get warm.\n\nOne night, they saw a firefly and considered it a dab of fire. All the monkeys in the group shouted 'Fire, Fire, Fire, Yeah we got fire!'\n\nA couple of monkeys tried to catch the firefly and it escaped. They were sad as they could not catch the fire. They were talking to themselves that they couldn't live in the cold if they didn't get the fire.\n\nThe next night, again they saw many fireflies. After several attempts, the monkeys caught a few fireflies. They put the fireflies in a hole dug in the land and tried to blow the flies.\n\nThey blew the flies very hard without knowing the fact that they were flies!\n\nAn owl was watching the activities of the monkeys. The owl reached the monkeys and told them, 'Hey those are not fire! They are flies. You won't be able to make fire from it!'\n\nThe monkeys laughed at the owl. One monkey replied the owl, 'Hey old owl you don't know anything about how to make fire. Don't disturb us!'\n\nThe Owl warned the monkeys again and asked them to stop their foolish act. 'Monkeys, you cannot make fire from the flies! Please hear my words.'\n\nThe monkeys tried to make fire from the flies.\n\nThe Owl told them again to stop their foolish act. 'You are struggling so much, go take your shelter in a nearby cave. You can save yourself from the freezing cold! You won't get fire!'\n\nOne monkey shouted at the owl and the owl left the place.\n\nThe monkeys were simply doing the foolish activity for several hours and it was almost midnight. They were very tired and realized that the words of the owl were correct and they were trying to blow a fly.\n\nThey sheltered themselves at the cave and escaped from the cold.\n\nWe may go wrong many times and should seek and accept the advice / suggestions provided by others."

      "title": "The Secret of Happiness",
      "body": "Once upon a time, there were three brothers named Samuel, Timothy and Xander, who lived in a cottage by the woods. They were honest and hardworking. Every day, they would venture into the forest to fell wood. Later, they would sell it in the market where it would fetch a decent price. Thus, their life continued in this manner.\n\nHowever, the brothers were always sad and morose. Even though they lived a good life, they were unhappy. Each one hankered for something or the other and would pine for it.\n\nOne day, while Samuel, Timothy and Xander were returning home from the woods carrying their bundle of logs, they saw an old haggard woman bent low with a sack on her back. As they were kind and compassionate, the brothers immediately approached the poor woman and offered to carry the sack all the way to her home. She smiled and expressed her gratefulness, while replying that the sack actually contained apples that she had collected in the forest. Samuel, Timothy and Xander took turns in carrying the sack, and at last, when they reached the woman's home, they were very tired indeed.\n\nNow, this old woman was no ordinary person and had magical powers. Pleased with the brothers' kind and selfless nature, she asked them whether there was anything she could help them with, as a reward.\n\n\"We are not happy, and that has become our greatest cause of concern,\" replied Samuel. The woman asked what would make them happy. Each brother spoke of a different thing that would please him.\n\n\"A splendid mansion with plenty of servants would make me happy. There is nothing more that I would want,\" said Samuel.\n\n\"A big farm with lots of harvest would make me happy. Then I could be rich without having to worry,\" said Timothy.\n\n\"A beautiful wife would make me happy. Every day, after returning home, her sweet little face would light me up and make me forget my sorrows,\" said Xander.\n\n\"That is fine,\" said the old woman, \"If these things will give you happiness, you deserve them in every respect for helping a poor helpless person like me. Go home, and each of you shall find exactly what you have wished for.\"\n\nThis took the brothers by surprise as they did not know about the woman's powers. Nevertheless, they took leave and returned home. But lo behold, beside their cottage, there was a huge mansion with a doorman and other servants waiting outside! They greeted Samuel and ushered him in. At some distance, a yellow farmland showed itself. A ploughman came and announced that it belonged to Timothy. Timothy gasped. Just at that moment, a beautiful maiden approached Xander and coyly said that she was his wife. The brothers were beside themselves with joy at this new turn of events. They thanked their lucky stars and adapted to their new lifestyles.\n\nThe days passed and soon a year was over. The situation was however, now different for Samuel, Timothy and Xander. Samuel had grown tired of owning the mansion. He became lazy and did not supervise his servants into taking proper care of the mansion. Timothy, who had built a decent house next to his farmland, found it burdensome to plough the fields and sow seeds from time to time. Xander too, grew used to his beautiful wife and no longer found any joy in keeping her company. In short, all of them were unhappy again.\n\nOne day, the three of them met up and decided to visit the old woman at her home. \"That woman has magical powers which turned our dreams into reality. However, since we are no longer happy, we must go and seek her help now. It is she who will be able to tell us the secret to attaining happiness,\" said Samuel.\n\nWhen they came to the old woman, she was cooking stew in a pot. Greeting her, each of the brothers recounted how he had turned unhappy again. \"Please tell us how we can once more be happy,\" said Timothy.\n\nOld Woman\"Well,\" replied the old woman. \"It is all in your own hands. See, when each of you made his wish and it was granted, you were happy. However, happiness never lasts without a very important thing - content. Earlier, since you were happy but never really content or satisfied, boredom and misery overcame you and you became sad again. Only if you learn to be content, can you truly enjoy the bliss of happiness.\"\n\nSamuel, Timothy and Xander realized their mistake and went back home. They saw how lucky they were to have the gifts for which they had once craved. Samuel felt grateful for being the owner of a mansion and began taking good care of it. Timothy began to plough his land diligently so as to have a good harvest in time. Xander too learnt to appreciate his pretty wife's chores in the house and her devotion towards him. Remembering that happiness and content went side by side, never again did the brothers take their blessings for granted. And thus, they lived happily ever after."

The management decided to teach the employees about finding real solution to the problems.\n\nThe team was called to play a game in a banquet hall. The group was quite surprised as they were called for playing game. All reached the venue holding various thoughts. As they entered the hall, they found the hall decorated beautifully with colourful decorative papers and balloons all over the place. It was more like a kid's play area, than a corporate meeting hall.\n\nEveryone was surprised and gazed at each other. Also, there was a huge box of balloons placed at the centre of the hall.\n\nThe team leader asked everyone to pick a balloon from the box and asked them to blow it. Every one happily picked a balloon and blew it.\n\nThen the team leader asked them to write their names on their balloon, carefully so that the balloons didn't blow up. All tried to write their names on the balloons, but not everyone was successful. A few balloons blew up due to pressure and they were given another chance to use another balloon.\n\nThose who failed to mark their names even after the second chance were ruled out of the game. After the second chance, 25 employees were qualified for the next level.

Also, he told them that no balloon should blow up and warned them to be very careful!\n\nAll 25 employees reached the room, where the balloons carrying their names were thrown here and there. They were searching for the respective balloons carrying their names. While they were in a rush to find the respective balloons, they tried not to burst the balloons. It was almost 15 minutes and no one was able to find the balloon carrying his own name.\n\nThe team was told that the second level of the game was over.\n\nNow it is the third and final level. They asked the employees to pick any balloon in the room and give it to the person named on the balloon. Within a couple of minutes all balloons reached the hands of the respective employee and everyone reached the hall.\n\nThe team leader announced; this is called real solutions to the problems. Everyone is frantically hunting for solutions to the problems without understanding the ideal ways. Many times, sharing and helping others give you real solutions to all problems.\n\nHelp out each other to ease things."

I have the most beautiful heart in the world.\"\n\nMany people looked at him and were stunned to see his beautiful heart in a perfect shape, without any flaw. It looked quite amazing. Most of the people who saw his heart were mesmerized by the beauty of his heart, and praised him.\n\nHowever, there came an old man who challenged the young man, \"No my son, I have got the most beautiful heart in the world!\"\n\nThe young man asked him, \"Show me your heart, then!\"\n\nThe old man showed his heart to him. It was very rough, uneven, and had scars all over. In addition, the heart was not in shape; it appeared like bits and pieces joined in various colours. There were some rough edges; some parts were removed, and fitted with other pieces.\n\nThe young man started laughing, and said, \"My dear old man, are you mad? See, my heart! How beautiful and flawless it is. You cannot find even a bit of imperfection in my heart. See, yours? It is full of scars, wounds, and blemishes. How can you say your heart is beautiful?\"\n\n\"Dear boy, my heart is just as beautiful as your heart is. Did you see the scars? Each scar represents the love I shared with a person. I share a piece of my heart with others when I share love, and in return I get a piece of heart, which I fix at the place from where I have torn a piece!\" said the old man.\n\nThe young man was shocked.\n\nThe old man continued, \"Since the pieces of heart I shared were neither equal nor in the same shape or size, my heart is full of uneven edges and bits and pieces. My heart is not in shape because sometimes I do not get love in return from those to whom I gave it. Your heart that looks fresh and full with no scars indicates that you never shared love with anybody. Isn't that true?\"\n\nThe young man stood still and did not speak a word. Tears rolled down his cheeks. He walked to the old man, tore a piece of his heart and gave the piece to the old man.\n\nMany give importance and respect to physical beauty.

The boys used to stare at him, and say nothing; and when he was out of sight, they breathed freely. So the proud boy was lonely, and would have had no friends out of doors if it had not been for two stray dogs, the green trees, and a flock of geese upon the common.\n\nOne day, just by the weaver's cottage, he met the tailor's son. Now the tailor's son made more noise than any other boy in the village, and when he had done anything wrong he stuck to it, and said he didn't care; so the neighbours thought that he was very brave, and would do wonders when he came to be a man, and some of them hoped he would be a great traveller, and stay long in distant lands. When the tailor's son saw the proud boy he danced in front of him, and made faces, and provoked him sorely, until, at last, the proud boy turned round and suddenly boxed the ears of the tailor's son, and threw his hat into the road. The tailor's son was surprised, and, without waiting to pick up his hat, ran away, and sitting down in the carpenter's yard, cried bitterly. After a few minutes, the proud boy came to him and returned him his hat, saying politely.\n\n\"There is no dust on it ; you deserved to have your ears boxed, but I am sorry I was so rude as to throw your hat on to the road.\"\n\n\"I thought you were proud,\" said the tailor's son, astonished; \"I didn't think you'd say that I wouldn't.\"\n\"Perhaps you are not proud?\"\n\"No, I am not.\"\n\n\"Ah, that makes a difference,\" said the proud boy, still more politely. \"When you are proud, and have done a foolish thing, you make a point of owning it.\"\n\n\"But it takes a lot of courage,\" said the tailor's son.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" answered the proud boy; \"it only takes a lot of cowardice not to;\" and then turning his eyes down again, he softly walked away.\n"

I will buy a new wood horse for you!'\n\nTina replied, 'You think it doesn't matter that a leg of my pet toy was broken?'\nHer brother replied, 'Yes dear!'\n\nTina replied, 'Yes brother you are right. It won't be a major issue for you even if the horse is broken into pieces at this age. But if you are in my age, if you had a pet like I had, you will feel how painful it would be to even if a small part of horse is broken!'\nHer brother left silently!\n\nJust like Tina, everyone has different feelings of different aspects.

On they went, on and on through the corn-field towards the broad green meadows stretching far into the distance. On and on, he shouting for joy, and she laughing out so merrily that the sound travelled to the edge of the wood, and the thrushes heard, and dreamed of Spring. On they went, on and on, and round and round, he in his red jacket, and she with the wild flowers dropping one by one from her wreath. On and on in the moonlight, on and on till they had danced all down the corn-field, till they had crossed the green meadows, till they were hidden in the mist beyond.\n\nThat is all I know; but I think that in the far far off somewhere, where the moon is shining, he and she still dance along a corn-field, he in his red jacket, and she with the wild flowers dropping from her hair."

The place he lived didn't provide him a chance to visit the elephants. All his only desire was to see and touch at least an elephant before he die. Fortunately, when he was 25 years he got a chance to join a crew of wildlife lovers.\n\nHe enquired them about their plans and with eagerness, he asked whether they would take him to see the elephants. And they said yes.\n\nThe journey happily began and they visited various places. Suri was so happy and enjoyed the tour to the core. He was waiting for years to visit the elephants in real life and the day came.\n\nAs they passed through the forests, they walked past a beautiful village. One from the team said that the village had more than 100 elephants and Suri could enjoy the entire day in that village. There was nothing in the world that could measure Suri's happiness hearing those words.\n\nFinally he saw those elephants for the first time in his life. He was amazed to see the elephants and screamed happily.\n\nAfter spending two to three hours just seeing the elephants, he was shocked to see those elephants tied to a frail fence. It was a thin rope, not even a chain and there was no cage or any kind of shelter where the elephants lived. Instead, there were simple sheds without any doors.\n\nElephant tied with ropeSuri was surprised as he knew the strength of elephants and saw them tied to strong chains in the television. He enquired one of the countrymen about why they were left freely without any protection and also asked 'won't they easily break the rope?'\n\nThe trainer answered Suri, 'They won't'\n\nSuri was surprised and asked how?\n\nThe trainer replied, 'They were trained here since their childhood. When they were babies we used to tie them with a strong rope and the kid elephants weren't able to break them. The rope or chain we used to tie them when they were small. It was strong enough to hold them. A few elephants would try to break the rope or chain, but could not set them free. So as they grew, they developed a false belief that the small and thin ropes were too strong for them to break and they continued to get tied by their belief!'\n\nSuri was amazed as well as shocked. The powerful mammoth wasn't strong enough mentally to get them free from a thin rope.\n\nHowever, he left the place as he was happy to see the elephants.\n\nOur lives are like the elephant's false beliefs.

He promised her mother to bring something and went on to search for a work.\n\nA farmer offered him work in his land and paid two pennies for Jack's work.\n\nJack thanked him and rushed to home with the pennies in hand. As he was running to home, he did not notice the pennies rolled down from his hand. He could not find the coins and reached home with unhappy face.\n\nHe told the incident to his mom. Jack's mom told him, 'dear Jack, next time, you put them in your pocket, so that they won't fall!'\n\nThe next day, a milkman offered Jack a job. Jack was offered a jar of milk as wages for his work. As told by his mother, he poured the milk into his pocket and ran towards his mom.\n\nHis mom recognized what would have happened after seeing Jack's dress. She told him,' Jack, you should have carried the milk jar on your head. Don't worry. But be careful next time!'\n\nNext time also Jack worked for the milkman and he went to the milkman's farm early in the morning. The work got completed before the noon and Jack was paid a bar of cheese for his work. Jack was happy and as told by his mother, he carried the cheese bar on his head. Since it was a sunny day and very hot in the noon, all the cheese melted away.\n\nJack told his mom that all cheese melted. His mother told, he should have carried the cheese in his hands and asked him to do correctly next time.\n\nThe next day, he went to work in cattle. The owner of the cattle farm offered him a little kitten for him towards wages as Jack liked the kitten very much. He carried the kitten on his hands. The little kitten jumped from his hands and ran away. Jack was sad and told his mother he lost the kitten too.\n\nHis mom told, he should have tied a rope and dragged the kitten on the road.\n\nFor the next two days, he went to work in a farm again and returned home with a huge piece of meat. He tied the meat with a rope and dragged it on the road. The meat was spoiled and his mom shouted at him as he could not do anything properly.\n\nLater sometime, she consoled him and told him that he should have carried the meat on his shoulders.\n\nJack went to nearby town for work and returned home after a week. For his hard work, he was rewarded with a donkey and he carried the donkey on his shoulders.\n\nA young girl around 8 years of age who saw Jack carrying the donkey on shoulders started to laugh and she laughed continuously for long time. Her dad, who was the richest person in the town, was so happy and was in tears. He thanked Jack as he made her daughter laugh after 5 years. Jack realized his mistakes and foolishness he done then and before. But at the same time his foolishness made that rich man's daughter laugh. He took the rich man and his daughter to his home. The rich man offered them work and shelter in his bungalow. From that incident, he tried to do everything properly without any mistakes and foolishness and they lived happily ever after!"

The trail seemed to be of less used one and solely was reflecting a horror affect as there were bare trees though the climate was chilled winter.\n\nThe scene disappointed me as I supposed that once again I am going to catch 22 as customary. So the dreadful stance pushed me to soon get off the place and so I set my weariness body in forward mode, the dry pale yellow leaves had also got in motion with me as if a bit of my restricted vim got transferred to them too.\n\nAbsolutely after three nasty paces I came across an old sturdy man, walking on the neighbor road. I summoned him on to assist me out with an address to city…but the man overlooked and went on without responding. I called him for the second time but this time he gave me a glared look and answered with some offensive words, ‘’there is no address for the city but the ways only leads to success.’’ the old man’s words made me wonder for hours but I was still beating around the bush and couldn’t get to the point.\n\nIn that case I kick started covering some more distances when I met an old greasy hand pump. Certainly I wasn’t thirsty but was in a need of clearing my messy look, so immediately I responded to the presence of water pump but it was pretty much hard to operate it as it has been there without drawn into use since ages. however it was a moment to cheer up for I was successful in moving the handle up and down but unfortunately water did not make any gesture I spontaneously worked on pump for some more minutes but yet there was no sign of water so finally I fell apart and was in a mood of taking rest so I counted on a nearby tree to confer me with shelter.\n\nThe opted place was a bit grimy; accordingly I was looking for broom kind of thing when I came across a heap of dried, fresh leaves. I carelessly disrupted the neatly drawn heap and came out with an eccentric massive leaf which was indeed not found in the area where I found it. But yet for a while I rummaged around to know if the tree was really situated around but I was proved correct. That kind of species can’t be grown in such a location.\n\nSo I owned it to broom my place. After the act of clearing, when I was above to throw it at that time an idea was born in my hectic mind for via the leaf into a self entertaining work.\n\nGradually I came up with an initiative of scripting an ode on the rarely found leaf. The thoughts started to flow in fact I was completely in the world of thoughts where I was put out of my mind about the actual world. Hours passed away, I felt like I got back to my mom and dad but hastily a tremendous thunder drew me out of the thoughtful world. And unluckily I had to hurry up because the condition of weather reflected that it was going to rain. I was to look for a cottage or protective place so I drew together all my belongings and set on for the destiny.\n\nLuckily after covering up some miles I got an aged cottage. It seemed to be dwelled by someone as a dim beam of light with as seen.\n\nImmediately I made my presence at the wooden door and knocked stridently. The door was opened by a fair young lady. I asked her if I could have a night stay at her cottage for tonight. She instantaneously replied with a positive answer. The lady bid me to go for refreshment and then arrive on dining slab for a hot winter tea. Submitting to her polite words I removed my bag and placed it on a table.\n\nAfter the healthy tea I asked the pretty lady for the way to guest room for having a night but I forgot my bag in the drawing room. I was just above to close the eyelids when a stormy wind hit the windows. And consequently the wind broke into the house and my bag kept downstairs fell on ground and leaf of epic flew to the lady standing near it. First the lady thought that it would be personal but she knew that nobody records a personal thing on a leaf. And so she gazed at it. It said,\n\n‘’I’M LONE\n\nIN THE MISTY CHILLED DARKNESS\n\nWHY IS IT BLOWN?\n\nTO ME THE LONELINESS.\n\nOOO MY SOUL\n\nFAR AWAY FROM YOUR GOAL\n\nGO GET INTO THE HOLE\n\nTO PERCEIVE A BOON………\n\nThe next morning I thanked and requested the lady to just drop me to a nearby city in her very own car. We set out for the city and luckily got to one where she took me to a building named as AUTHOR’S DESTINE. It seemed strange but as I stepped out of the car a rush of media surrounded me with camera and was continually raising questions about the epic written by me on the leaf. I was knocked for six that where did they get my ode from but soon the confusion left me and I found out that the helpful lady was a publisher and she read it last night and was impressed by it. Subsequently everyone was showering flowers on me when I felt something disgusting. In place of flowers there was bucket full of water in the hands of my mom which she was pouring on me in the early morning to wake me up for usual dragging to the school. When I got up then I realized that it was just a nightmare."

If you want to drink sweet and cold water, come down and experience the pleasure here.\n\nWithout thinking of the result she jumped into the well. The fox at once jumped on her back, and with another jump he was out of well. The fox smiled at the poor goat and went his way leaving behind the goat to repent.\n\nMoral:\n\nLook before you leap."

      "body": "There was a cap seller in a city. He used to go from village to village to sell the caps. His way lay through a forest.\n\nIt was a hot summer day and it was very hot. He got tired. To get some rest he sat under a shaded tree.\n\nSoon he fell asleep under the shadow of the tree. Many monkeys were living on that tree. When they saw the caps they climbed down the tree and each one of them put a cap on their head. Then they climbed up the tree again.\n\nThe cap seller woke up after some time. He found that his caps were missing. By chance he looked up and saw the monkeys wearing his caps. He tried his best to get his caps back but all his efforts were in vain.\n\nSuddenly an idea struck his mind. He took off his own cap and threw it on the ground. Monkeys did the same as they are imitators. The cap seller collected all his caps and went away happily.\n\nMoral:\n\nIntelligence works wonders."

      "body": "There comes a point in our life where we really have to consider our lifestyle. How we eat, how we dress, but most importantly, who we hang out with.\n\nI know how it feels to have to kind of cut your self of from friends. But sometimes if you hang around immature losers, you will find yourself in a sticky situation. So please drop the dead weight\n\nOne day, I got suspended from school saying something inappropriate. (b*** job). I almost passed out because when I said it, the whole class became quiet. Now what do you think that made me look like. An immature loser of course! I got my self in trouble repeating what another friend said. Guess what, he didn't get in trouble I did.\n\nThis was very uncomfortable to talk about with my mom. I think this is because I am trying to become a better Christian, and when you do so, you don't get away with the stuff you used to, but thats another story.\n\nAfter this incident, I woke up one morning and said \"what was I thinkin' .\"  I began to investigate would led me to have such a fowl mouth. Then it clicked like a lightbulb . . . Its because of the people I hang around.\n\nThese guys I hang with are very negative. You can barely say anything to them without them thinking negative. For example if I say something refering to a test and i say \" that was very hard\", I think ya'll can read between the lines. Immature losery like, isn't it.\n\nWhen I returned to school, I have to admit, I began to hang around those same guys. Then I caught myself and I didn't completely ignore them, but I did distance myself. Doing so has changed my lifestyle. I don't laugh at everything, I can be quiet in class, and I have gained respect and dignity for myself and others and have been able to think straighter and pray more effectively. I really thank God for that. People who do not even know about the incident have given me compliments saying you are really turning out to be a real gentleman.\n\nOnce again I say, stay away from immature losers so you can stop being one or don't become one. Yes those guys are popular, but since I was one of those guys, I know better. You may feel left out, but after while, feeling better about yourself is much more important, and you get a head start on the maturity us yungins need when we get older. God will be very pleased with you as well.\n\nYes, I know that I know that I know that I know it is very hard, but drop the deadweight. God loves you and he really wants to bless you and oh he is very real. Yes there are some hard trials, some situations where you might want to question God, but its for the better.\n\nThe only reasons God can’t bless you is because of your fear, ignorance, or things that you put in your life that won't let God reach you.\n\nOnce again I say please DROP THE DEAD WEIGHT!"

No matter how much he tried,  he could never hit the target.\nAt lunchtime, grandma called out, “Sammy, it’s lunchtime!” Getting a little discouraged, he headed back for the lunch. While walking back, Sammy noticed his Grandma’s pet. It was a cute, little duck. Out of excitement he took his slingshot and aimed at the duck.

He climbed to the treetop, ate the apples, took a napunder the shadow.. he loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him. Timewent by.. the little boy had grown up and he no longer played around the treeevery day. \n\nOne day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad. ‘Come and play withme’ the tree asked the boy. ‘I am no longer a kid, I do not play around treesany more’ the boy replied. ‘I want toys. I need money to buy them.’ ‘Sorry, butI do not have money.. but you can pick all my apples and sell them. So, you willhave money.’ The boy was so excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree andleft happily. The boy never came back after he picked the apples. The tree wassad. \n\nOne day, the boy who now turned into a man returned and the tree was excited‘Come and play with me’ the tree said. ‘I do not have time to play. I have towork for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?” Sorry, but Ido not have any house. But you can chop off my branches to build your house.’ Sothe man cut all the branches of the tree and left happily. The tree was glad tosee him happy but the man never came back since then. The tree was again lonelyand sad. \n\nOne hot summer day, the man returned and the tree was delighted. ‘Come andplay with me!’ the tree said. ‘I am getting old. I want to go sailing to relaxmyself. Can you give me a boat?’ said the man. ‘Use my trunk to build your boat.You can sail far away and be happy.’ So the man cut the tree trunk to make aboat. He went sailing and never showed up for a long time. \n Finally, the man returned after many years. ‘Sorry, my boy. But I do not haveanything for you anymore. No more apples for you’ the tree said. ‘No problem, Ido not have any teeth to bite’ the man replied. ‘No more trunk for you to climbon’ the tree said. ‘I am too old for that now’ the man said. ‘I really cannotgive you anything.. the only thing left is my dying roots’ the tree said withtears. ‘I do not need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all theseyears’ the man replied. ‘Good!

      "body": "Sacrifice Of A Mother:\n\nMy mom only had one eye. I hated her… she was such an embarrassment. My mom ran a small shop at a flea market. She collected little weeds and such to sell… anything for the money we needed she was such an embarrassment. There was this one day during elementary school.\nI remember that it was field day, and my mom came. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school… “Your mom only has one eye?!” and they taunted me.\n\nI wished that my mom would just disappear from this world so I said to my mom, “Mom, why don’t you have the other eye?! You’re only going to make me a laughingstock. Why don’t you just die?” My mom did not respond. I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I’d wanted to say all this time. Maybe it was because my mom hadn’t punished me, but I didn’t think that I had hurt her feelings very badly.\n\nThat night… I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me. I took a look at her, and then turned away. Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in the corner of my heart. Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out of her one eye. So I told myself that I would grow up and become successful, because I hated my one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty.\n\nThen I studied really hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul and studied, and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the confidence I had. Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too. Now I’m living happily as a successful man. I like it here because it’s a place that doesn’t remind me of my mom.\n\nThis happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when someone unexpected came to see me “What?! Who’s this?!” It was my mother… Still with her one eye. It felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me. My little girl ran away, scared of my mom’s eye.\n\nAnd I asked her, “Who are you? I don’t know you!!” as if I tried to make that real. I screamed at her “How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter! Get out of here now!!” And to this, my mother quietly answered, “oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,” and she disappeared. Thank goodness… she doesn’t recognize me. I was quite relieved. I told myself that I wasn’t going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life.\n\nThen a wave of relief came upon me… one day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. I lied to my wife saying that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to call a house…just out of curiosity there, I found my mother fallen on the cold ground. But I did not shed a single tear. She had a piece of paper in her hand…. it was a letter to me.\n\nShe wrote:\nMy World Shattered.  I hated the person who only lived for me .   I cried for My Mother, I didn’t know of any way that will make up for my worst deeds…\n\nMoral:  Never Ever hate anyone for their disabilities.  Never disrespect your parents, don’t ignore and under estimate their sacrifices.  They give us life, they raise us better than they had been, they give and keep trying to give better than they ever had.  They never wish unwell for their kids even in their wildest dreams.  They always try showing right path and being motivator.  Parents give up all for kids, forgive all mistakes made by kids.  There is no way to repay what they done for kids, all we can do is try giving what they need and it is just time, love and respect."

      "body": "The Gardener And The Noble Family:\n\nAbout four miles from the city stood an old manor house with thick walls, towers, and pointed gables. Here lived, but only in the summer season, a rich and noble family. Of all the different estates they owned, this was the best and the most beautiful; on the outside it looked as if it had just been cast in a foundry, and the inside was made for comfort and ease. The family coat of arms was carved in stone over the gate; beautiful roses climbed about the arms and the balconies; the courtyard was covered with grass; there were red thorn and white thorn, and many rare flowers even outside the greenhouse.\n\nThe owners of the manor house also had a very skillful gardener. It was a pleasure to see the flower garden, the orchard, and the vegetable garden. A part of the manor's original old garden was still there, consisting of a few box-tree hedges cut so that they formed crowns and pyramids. Behind these stood two old, mighty trees, almost always without leaves, and one might easily think that a storm or a waterspout had scattered great lumps of dirt on their branches, but each lump was a bird's nest. Here, from time immemorial, a screaming swarm of crows and rooks had built their nests; it was a regular bird town, and the birds were the owners, the manor's oldest family - the real lordship! The people below meant nothing to them; they tolerated these crawling creatures, even if every now and then they shot with their guns, making the birds' backbones shiver, so that every bird flew up in fear and cried, \"Rak! Rak!\"\n\nThe gardener often spoke to the noble family about cutting down the old trees; they did not look well, and by taking them away they might also get rid of the shrieking birds, which then would probably look for another place. But the family did not want to give up either the trees or the swarm of birds; that was something the manor could not lose, something from the olden times, which should never be forgotten.\n\n\"Why, those trees are the birds' heritage by this time, so let them keep them, my good Larsen!\" Larsen was the gardener's name, but that is of very little consequence to this story.\n\n\"Haven't you space enough to work in, little Larsen? Have you not the flower garden, the greenhouse, the orchard, and the vegetable garden?\"\n\nYes, those he had, and he cared for them; he kept them in order and cultivated them with affection and ability, and that the noble family knew; but they did not conceal from him that they often saw flowers and tasted fruits in other people's homes that surpassed what they had in their garden, and that made the gardener sad, for he always wished to do his best and really did his best. He was goodhearted and a good and faithful worker.\n\nOne day the noble family sent for him and told him, very kindly, that the day before, at some distinguished friend's home, they had eaten apples and pears that were so juicy and so well flavored that they and all the other guests had expressed their admiration. It was doubtful if the fruits were native, but they ought to be imported and grown here, provided the climate would permit it. It was known that they had been bought from the finest fruit dealer in the city, and it was decided that the gardener was to go there and find out where these apples and pears came from and then order some slips for grafting. The gardener knew the fruit dealer well, because he was the very person to whom he sold the superfluous fruit that grew in the manor garden.\n\nAnd the gardener went to town and asked the dealer where he got those highly praised apples and pears. \"Why, they are from your own garden,\" said the fruit dealer, and showed him both the apples and pears, which he recognized immediately.\n\nHow happy the gardener felt! He hurried back to the family and told them that both the apples and the pears were from their own garden. That they couldn't believe! \"That's not possible, Larsen! Can you get a written guarantee to that effect from the fruit dealer?\"\n\nYes, that he could, and a written guarantee he brought.\n\n\"That certainly is remarkable!\" said the noble family.\n\nNow every day great dishes filled with wonderful apples and pears from their own garden were set on the table. Bushels and barrels of these fruits were sent to friends in the city and outside the city; yes, even to foreign lands. This afforded great pleasure; yet the family added that the last two summers had, of course, been remarkably good for tree fruits and these had done very well all over the country.\n\nSome time passed. The family were dinner guests at court. The next day they sent for the gardener. At the royal table they had eaten melons, very juicy and wonderfully flavored, from their majesties' greenhouse.\n\n\"You must go to the court gardener, my good Larsen, and let him give you some seeds of those precious melons.\"\n\n\"But the court gardener got his melon seeds from us!\" said the gardener, very pleased.\n\n\"Then that man knows how to bring the fruit to a higher perfection!\" answered the family. \"Each melon was splendid.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I really can feel proud!\" said the gardener. \"I must tell your lordship that the court gardener had had bad luck with his melons this year, and when he saw how beautiful ours looked, and then tasted them, he ordered three of them for the castle.\"\n\n\"Larsen, don't try to tell us that those were melons from our garden.\"\n\n\"I really believe so,\" said the gardener.\n\nAnd he went to the court gardener, from whom he got a written guarantee to the effect that the melons on the royal table were from the manor. This was really a big surprise to the family, and they did not keep the story to themselves; the written guarantee was displayed, and melon seeds were sent far and wide, as grafting slips had been earlier.\n\nThese slips, the family learned, had taken and begun to bear fruit of an excellent kind. This was named after the family manor, and the name became known in English, German, and French. This, no one had expected. \"Let's hope the gardener won't get big ideas about himself,\" said the family.\n\nBut he took it in a different way; he would strive now to be known as one of the best gardeners in the country and to produce something superior out of all sorts of garden stuff every year. And that he did. But often he was told that the very first fruits he brought out, the apples and the pears, were, after all, the best, that all later variations were very inferior to these. The melons were very good, to be sure, though, of course, they belonged to another species; his strawberries might be called delicious, but no better than those grown by other gardeners, and when one year his radishes did not turn out very well, they spoke only of the unsuccessful radishes and not about all the other fine products he had developed.\n\nIt almost seemed as if the family felt a relief in saying, \"It didn't go well this year, little Larsen!\" Yes, they seemed quite happy when they said, \"It didn't go well this year!\"\n\nTwice a week the gardener brought fresh flowers up to their drawing room, always arranged with such taste and artistry that the colors seemed to appear even brighter.\n\n\"You have good taste, Larsen,\" said the noble family, \"but that is a gift from our Lord, not from yourself!\"\n\nOne day the gardener brought a large crystal bowl; in it floated a water-lily leaf upon which was laid a beautiful blue flower as big as a sunflower.\n\n\"The lotus of Hindustan!\" exclaimed the family.\n\nThey had never seen a lotus flower before. In the daytime it was placed in the sunlight and in the evening under artificial light. Everyone who saw it found it remarkably beautiful and unusual; yes, even the most highborn young lady in the country, the wise and kindhearted Princess, said so. The family considered it an honor to present her with the flower, and the Princess took it with her to the castle. Then they went down to their garden to pick another flower of the same kind, but none was to be found. So they sent for the gardener and asked him where he got the blue lotus flower.\n\n\"We have been looking for it in vain,\" they said. \"We have been in the greenhouses and round about the flower garden!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it's not there,\" said the gardener. \"It is only a common flower from the vegetable garden; but, look, isn't it beautiful! It looks like a blue cactus, and yet it is only the flower of the artichoke!\"\n\n\"You should have told us that immediately!\" said the noble family. \"Naturally, we supposed it was a rare, foreign flower. You have ridiculed us to the young Princess! She saw the flower in our house and thought it was beautiful; she didn't know the flower, although she knows her botany well, but then, of course, that science has nothing to do with kitchen herbs. How could you do it, Larsen! To place such a flower in our drawing room is enough to make us ridiculous!\"\n\nAnd the gorgeous blue flower from the vegetable garden was taken out of the drawing room, where it didn't belong; yes, and the noble family apologized to the Princess and told her that the flower was only a kitchen herb that the Gardener had had the idea of exhibiting, and that he had been severely reprimanded for it.\n\n\"That was a shame, and very unfair,\" said the Princess. \"He has really opened our eyes to a magnificent flower we otherwise would have paid no attention to; he has shown us beauty where we didn't expect to find it. As long as the artichoke is in bloom, our court gardener shall daily bring one of them up to my private room!\"\n\nAnd this was done.\n\nThe noble family told the gardener that he could again bring them a fresh artichoke flower.\n\n\"It is really beautiful!\" they said. \"Highly remarkable!\" And the gardener was praised.\n\n\"Larsen likes that,\" said the noble family. \"He is like a spoiled child.\"\n\nIn the autumn there was a terrific storm. During the night it increased so violently that many of the large trees in the outskirts of the wood were torn up by the roots, and to the great grief of the noble family - yes, they called it grief - but to the gardener's delight, the two big trees with all the birds' nests blew down. Through the storm one could hear the screaming of the crows and the rooks as they beat their wings against the manor windows.\n\n\"Now, of course, you are happy, Larsen!\" said the noble family. \"The storm has felled the trees, and the birds have gone off into the forest. There is nothing from olden times left to see here; every sign and reference has disappeared; it makes us very sad!\"\n\nThe gardener said nothing, but he thought of what he had long had in his mind, how he could make use of that wonderful, sunny spot, now at his disposal; it could become the pride of the garden and the joy of the family.\n\nThe large trees, in falling, had crushed the very old box-tree hedges with all their fancy trimmings. Here he put in a multitude of plants, native plants from the fields and the woods. What no other gardener had ever thought of planting in a manor garden, he planted, giving each its appropriate soil, and sunlight or shadow, according to what the individual plant required. He gave them loving care, and everything grew magnificently.\n\nThe juniper tree from the heaths of Jutland rose in shape and color like the Italian cypress; the shiny, thorny Christ's-thorn, ever green, in the cold of winter and the sun of summer, was beautiful to behold. In the foreground grew ferns of various species; some of them looked as if they were children of the palm tree, others as if they were parents of the pretty plant we call Venus's-hair. Here stood the neglected burdock, so pretty in its freshness that it can be outstanding in a bouquet. The burdock stood in a dry place, but further down, in the moist soil, grew the coltsfoot, also a neglected plant and yet very picturesque with its enormous leaf and its tall stem. Six-feet tall, with flower after flower, like an enormous, many-armed candelabra, rose the mullein, just a mere field plant. Here grew the woodruff, the primrose, and the lily of the valley, the wild calla and the fine three-leaved wood sorrel. It was all wonderful to see.\n\nIn the front, in rows, grew very tiny pear trees from French soil, fastened to steel wires; by getting plenty of sun and good care they soon bore fruit as large and juicy as in their own country. In place of the two old leafless trees was set a tall flagpole from which Dannebrog - the flag of Denmark - proudly flew; and close by stood another pole, around which the hop tendril twisted and wound its fragrant flower cones in the summer and at harvesttime, but on which in the winter, according to an old custom, oat sheaves were hung, so that the birds could have a good meal during the happy Christmastime.\n\n\"Our good Larsen is getting sentimental in his old age,\" said the family, \"but he is true and faithful to us!\"\n\nAt New Year's, one of the city illustrated papers published a picture of the old manor; it showed the flagpole and the oat sheaves for the birds at the happy Christmastime, and the paper commented that it was a beautiful thought to uphold and honor this old custom, so appropriate to the old manor.\n\n\"Anything that Larsen does,\" said the noble family, \"they beat the drum for. He is a lucky man. We should almost be proud to have him!\"\n\nBut they were not a bit proud of it; they knew they were the masters of the manor, and they could dismiss Larsen, but that they wouldn't do. They were good people, and there are many good people of their kind in the world - and that is fortunate for all the Larsens.\n\nYes, that is the story of the gardener and the noble family. Now you may think about it!"

      "body": "Old Man and His Son:\n\nAn old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden, but it was very hard work. His only son, who would have helped him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and mentioned his situation: \n\nDear Son, I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won’t be able to plant my potato garden this year. I hate to miss doing the garden because your mother always loved planting time. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren’t in prison. Love, Dad Shortly, the old man received this telegram: ‘For Heaven’s sake, Dad, don’t dig up the garden!! That’s where I buried the GUNS!!’ At 4 a.m. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns. Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what had happened, and asked him what to do next. His son’s reply was: ‘Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad. It’s the best I could do for you, from here.’ \n\nMoral: No Matter where you are in the World, If you have decided to do something deep from your heart, you can do it. It is the thought that matters, not where you are or where the person is."

      "body": "The Neighboring Families:\n\nOne would certainly think that something quite unusual had happened in the duckpond to cause such a commotion, but nothing really had happened.\n\nAll the ducks that had been floating gracefully on the water, some standing on their heads, for they knew how to do that, now abruptly rushed straight onto land. Leaving their footprints in the wet clay, they shrieked so that one could hear them far away. The water was agitated. It had been smooth as a mirror, reflecting calmly and clearly everything around it; every tree and bush, the old peasant's cottage with holes in its gable, the swallow's nest, and especially the large rose tree whose branches and flowers covered the wall and hung almost into the water all these had been painted on the clear surface like a picture, only upside down. But now that the water was troubled, everything ran together, and the whole picture was ruined. Two feathers that had fallen from the ducks were tossed to and fro, and suddenly took flight as though carried away by the wind, yet there was no wind. And soon the feathers lay still, and the water became smooth as a mirror again, reflecting as before the peasant's cottage, the swallow's nest, and the rose tree. Each rose could see itself in the pond; all were beautiful, but they didn't know it - no one had told them so. The sun shone through their delicate petals, which were so full of fragrance, and each rose felt the way we do when we are happy in our thoughts.\n\n\"How delightful it is to live!\" said each rose. \"The only thing I'd wish for is to kiss the sun, because it's so warm and bright. Yes, and those lovely roses down in the water! I'd like to kiss them too; they're just like us. And I'd like to kiss those dear baby birds in the nest down there; yes, there are also some above us. They pop out their heads and twitter so softly, and they haven't any feathers like their father and mother! We certainly have pleasant neighbors, above and below. Oh, how wonderful it is to be alive!\" Now the young birds up above - yes, those down below were just their reflection in the water - were sparrows. Father and Mother Sparrow had taken possession of the empty swallow's nest the year before, and it was now their home.\n\n\"Are those the ducklings swimming down there?\" asked the young sparrows when they saw the two feathers drifting on the water.\n\n\"Ask sensible questions if you ask any,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Don't you see that they are feathers - live clothes, such as I wear, and you will have some day? Only ours are finer! But I wish we had those feathers up here; they'd make our nest warm and comfortable, I'd like to know what frightened the ducks just now! Must have been something in the water. I'm sure it wasn't I, even if I did say 'twit!' rather loudly. Those thick-headed roses ought to know, but they don't know anything; they only look at themselves and scent the air. I'm completely sick of these neighbors of ours!\"\n\n\"Listen to the sweet little birds up there!\" said the roses. \"They're really trying to sing; of course they can't yet, but they will in time. What a great pleasure that must be! It's such fun to have such happy neighbors!\"\n\nJust then there came galloping up to the pond two big horses, to be watered. A peasant boy was on one of them, and he had taken off all his clothes except his black hat, which was large and broad-brimmed. The boy whistled as if he himself were a little bird, as he rode through the deepest part of the pond. When he came to the rose tree, he broke off one of the roses and stuck it in his hat; then, considering himself properly decorated, he rode off with it. The other roses looked after their lost sister, and asked each other, \"Where has she gone to?\" But none of them knew.\n\n\"I think I would like to go out in the world, \" said one of the roses to another, \"but still it's nice here at home in our own green branches. The sun is so warm all day long, and at night the sky shines still more beautifully; then we can see through the many little holes that are in the sky.\"\n\nIt was the stars that they thought were holes, for the roses didn't know any better.\n\n\"We make it lively around the house!\" said the mother sparrow. \"People say that a swallow's nest brings luck, so they're glad to have us. But our neighbors here - a great rosebush like that against the wall only makes the place damp. I think they'll dig it up soon, and then perhaps corn will grow there. Roses are only to look at and smell, or at the most to stick in hats. Every year, I know from my mother, they fall to pieces; the peasant's wife collects them and sprinkles salt on them; they're given some French name that I can't pronounce, and don't care to, and then they're thrown into the fire to make a nice smell. You see, that's their life; they live only to please the ears and nose. Now you know!\"\n\nAs it became evening and the gnats danced in the warm air, where the clouds glowed so red, the nightingale came and sang to the roses. He sang that beauty was like the sunshine of the world, and that the beautiful lives forever. But the roses imagined that the nightingale was singing about himself, and indeed that may have been true. They never would have thought that the song might have been addressed to them, but it pleased them, and they wondered if the young sparrows might also become nightingales.\n\n\"I understood quite well what that bird was singing about,\" said the young sparrow. \"There was only one word I didn't understand. What is 'the beautiful'?\"\n\n\"That's nothing,\" said their mother. \"It's just an appearance. Up at the manor house the doves have a house of their own, and peas and grains of corn are spread out for them every day in the yard. I've dined with them, and you shall too sometime. 'Tell me who you go with, and I'll tell you who you are.' Well, up there at the manor house they have two birds with green necks and crests on their heads; the tail of each can spread out as though it were a large wheel, and has so many colors that it hurts your eyes to look at it. Peacocks, they are called, and they are 'the beautiful.' They should be stripped of their feathers; then they wouldn't look any differently than we others. I'd have plucked them myself, if they hadn't been so large.\"\n\n\"I'll pluck them!\" said the smallest sparrow, who had no feathers of his own yet.\n\nIn the farmhouse lived two young married people, who were very devoted to each other; they were industrious and healthy, and everything was very neat in their house. Sunday morning the young wife went out and gathered a handful of the loveliest roses, put them in a glass of water, and set it on the cupboard.\n\n\"Now I see it is Sunday,\" said the husband. He kissed his pretty little wife, and they sat down and read a psalm, holding hands, while the morning sun shone brightly through the window on the fresh roses and the young couple.\n\n\"I'm so tired of looking at this!\" said the mother of the sparrows as she looked down into the room; and then she flew away.\n\nShe did the same thing the following Sunday, for every Sunday fresh roses were placed in the glass, but the rose tree still blossomed just as much. The young sparrows, who now had feathers of their own, wanted to fly with their mother. But she said, \"You stay!\" And so they stayed.\n\nShe flew off; but, whatever the reason, she suddenly was caught in a horsehair net that some boys had fastened to a bough! The horsehair bound about her leg so tightly she thought it was cut in half. How it pained and terrified her! The boys sprang forward and seized the bird with a cruelly hard grasp.\n\n\"It's nothing but a sparrow!\" they said, but they wouldn't let her go. They took her home, and every time she cried they hit her on the beak.\n\nIn the farmhouse there was an old man who knew how to make soap for shaving and washing hands, soap in balls and pieces. He was a wandering, merry old fellow. When he saw the sparrow that the boys brought, and which they said they didn't care about, he said to them, \"Shall we make it beautiful?\"\n\nThe sparrow mother shivered with fear as he said this. Out of his box of the brightest colors he took a lot of shining gold leaf; then he sent the boys for an egg, smeared its white all over the sparrow, and laid the gold upon it. Thus the sparrow mother was gilt, but she didn't think about this pomp; her limbs shook with terror. Then the old soapmaker tore a piece of red cloth from his jacket, cut it into the shape of a cock's comb, and glued it on the bird's head.\n\n\"Now you shall see the golden bird fly!\" he said, and let the sparrow loose. In deadly horror, she flew away in the bright sunshine. My, how she glittered! All the sparrows, even a large crow, who was no youngster, were quite frightened at the sight. But they flew after her, for they wanted to know what this unusual bird was.\n\n\"Where from! Where from!\" screamed the crow.\n\n\"Wait a bit! Wait a bit!\" said the sparrows. But she would not wait; in terror and pain she flew on toward home. She was ready to sink to the earth, and the crowd of birds, small and large, increased every moment, and some even flew in to peck at her. \"Such a one! Such a one!\" they all cried.\n\n\"Such a one! Such a one!\" squeaked the young sparrows as she approached the nest. \"That is surely a young peacock, for there are the colors that hurt your eyes, as Mother said. Twit! That is 'the beautiful.'\" And then they attacked her with their little beaks, so that it wasn't possible for her to enter the nest; and she was so overcome with fright that she could no longer even say \"twit,\" much less say, \"I am your mother.\" The other birds all joined in pecking at her until every one of her feathers was gone; and, bleeding, the sparrow mother sank down into the rosebush.\n\n\"The poor animal!\" said the roses. \"Come, we will hide you. Rest your little head upon us!\"\n\nOnce more the sparrow mother spread her wings, but then folded them close to her body again, and died among her neighbors, the fresh, beautiful roses.\n\n\"Twit!\" said the young sparrows in the nest.\n\n\"What's become of Mother! I can't understand it. Could this be a trick of hers to teach us to look out for ourselves? She has left us the house for an inheritance, but which of us is to have it alone when we get families!\"\n\n\"Yes, I can't have you others here when I have a wife and children!\" said the smallest.\n\n\"I'll have more wives and children than you!\" said another.\n\n\"But I'm the oldest!\" said a third. Then they all got into a fight; they flapped their wings and pecked at each other, and - bumps! - one after another popped out of the nest! There they lay, full of anger; they held their heads to one side and blinked their upturned eyes; that was their way of sulking.\n\nThey could fly a little, and so they practiced some more. And finally they agreed that in order to recognize each other when they met in the world, they would say \"twit!\" and scrape three times with the left leg.\n\nThe youngest sparrow, who remained in the nest, puffed himself up as big as he could, for he was now the owner, but that did not last long. During the night, fire gleamed through the windows of the farmhouse; the flames burst forth from under the roof, and the dry straw went up in a blaze. The whole house burned, and with it the little sparrow and his nest; however, the young couple luckily escaped.\n\nWhen the sun was up next morning, and everything seemed so refreshed, as after a night's gentle sleep, there was nothing left of the farmhouse except some black, charred beams leaning against the chimney which was its own master now. The smoke still rose from the ground, but the whole rose tree stood fresh and blooming, with every bough mirrored in the calm water.\n\n\"My, how pretty those roses are there in front of the burnt-down house!\" said a man, who came by. \"It's the most charming little picture! I must have it!\" And the man took from his pocket a little book with white leaves and a pencil, for he was an artist, and he sketched the smoking ground, the charred beams, and the chimney that leaned more and more to one side; but first of all, the big, blooming rose tree, which was certainly beautiful, and was, of course, the reason the picture was drawn.\n\nLater that day two of the sparrows who had been born there came by. \"Where is the house?\" they said. \"Where is the nest? Twit! It's all burnt, and our strong brother is burnt, too! That's what he got for keeping the nest. Those roses escaped well! They're still standing there with red\n\nred cheeks. They don't mourn over their neighbors' misfortunes. I won't speak to them; and it's ugly here - that's my opinion!\" So they flew away.\n\nWhen autumn came, there was a beautiful sunshiny day; one would have thought it was in the middle of the summer. It was so dry and clean in the courtyard before the great steps at the manor house, and there walked the doves, both black and white, and violet, glistening in the sunshine. The old dove mothers waddled about and said to their children, \"Stand in groups! Stand in groups!\" For that made them look better.\n\n\"What are those little gray birds that run about among us?\" asked an old dove who had red and green in her eyes. \"Little gray ones! Little gray ones!\" she repeated.\n\n\"Those are sparrows, modest creatures. We have always been known to be good-natured, so we let them pick up a little of our corn. They don't talk to us, and they scrape so politely with their legs.\"\n\nYes, they scraped, three times with the left leg, and then said \"twit!\" and thus they recognized each other; they were three of the sparrows from the burnt house. \"It is very good to eat here,\" said the sparrows.\n\nThe doves walked about among themselves, carrying themselves proudly, and had private opinions to exchange. \"See that crop pigeon?\" said one about another. \"Do you see her and how she devours the peas? She gets too many! She gets the best! Coo, coo! See how bald she's getting in her crest! See that ugly, wicked creature! Coo, coo!\" And then the eyes of them all gleamed red with malice. \"Stand in groups, stand in groups! Little gray birds! Little gray ones! Coo! Coo! Coo!\" So it went on unceasingly, and so will it still be in a thousand years.\n\nThe sparrows ate well, and they heard well. Yes, and they even stood in groups with the others, but that didn't suit them. They were full, so they left the doves and exchanged opinions about them. Then they wriggled under the garden fence and, since the door to the garden room was open, one of them hopped upon the threshold. He was filled to satiety, and therefore courageous. \"Twit!\" he said. \"I dare do this!\"\n\n\"Twit!\" said another. \"I also dare do that, and more too!\" And then he hopped into the room.\n\nThere were no people there; the third saw this, and then he flew even farther into the room, and said, \"All the way in, or not at all! What a funny human nest this is! And what have they put up there? Why, what is that!\"\n\nRight in front of the sparrows bloomed the roses; they were mirrored in the pond, and the charred beams rested against the ready-to-fall\n\nchimney! Well, what was this? How did all this get in the manor parlor? And all three sparrows tried to fly over the roses and the chimney, but it was a flat wall that they flew against; it was all a painting, a large, beautiful piece of work that the artist had made from his little sketch.\n\n\"Twit!\" said the sparrows. \"It's nothing! It's only a likeness! Twit! That is 'the beautiful.' Can you understand it? For I can't!\" And then they flew out, because people came into the room.\n\nNow days and years went by; many times had the doves cooed, and quarreled too, the wicked birds! The sparrows had nearly frozen in winter, and lived luxuriously in summer; they were all engaged or married, or whatever one wants to call it, and those with young ones naturally thought his own were the handsomest and cleverest. One flew here and another there, and whenever they met they recognized each other by a \"twit!\" and three scrapes of the left leg.\n\nThe eldest of them, who was now such an old one, had no nest or young ones. She wanted so much to visit a large city, so she flew to Copenhagen.\n\nA big house of many colors stood by the palace and the canal, where there were vessels laden with apples and pottery. It's windows were wider at the bottom than at the top; the sparrow peered inside, and each room, she thought, looked like the inside of a tulip, with all sorts of colors and decorations. In the middle of the tulip stood white people; they were of marble and some of plaster, but to a sparrow they all looked the same.\n\nOn top of the house stood a metal car, with metal horses, and the Goddess of Victory, also of metal, driving them. This was Thorvaldsen's Museum!\n\n\"How it shines! How it shines!\" said the sparrow. \"This must be 'the beautiful'! Twit! But here it's larger than a peacock!\" She still remembered from when she was little what the most beautiful thing was that her mother knew.\n\nThen she flew down into the courtyard, and this was also lovely. There were palms and green foliage painted on the walls, and in the middle of the courtyard stood a big, blooming rose tree that spread its fresh green branches, with their many flowers, over a grave. She flew to it, for she saw several other sparrows there. \"Twit!\" she said, and scraped three times with her left leg. She had practiced that greeting many times in past days and years, but no one had understood it, for those who are once parted don't meet every day; the greeting had become hardly more than a habit. But today there were two old sparrows and one\n\nyoung one who said, \"twit!\" in return and scraped with their left legs.\n\n'Ah, good day, good day!\" It was a couple of the sparrows from the old nest, and a little one of the family. \"That we should meet here!\" They said, \"This is a very fine place, but there isn't much to eat. It's 'the beautiful.' Twit!\"\n\nAnd then many people came into the courtyard from one of the rooms where the beautiful marble figures stood, and they went to the grave that held the remains of the great master who had created those figures. All stood with their eyes on Thorvaldsen's grave, and some gathered scattered rose petals to save. There were people from faraway places; they had come from mighty England from Germany, and France; and the fairest lady took one of the roses and placed it near her heart.\n\nThe sparrows then thought that the roses reigned there, that the whole house had been built for them. This seemed to them to be really a little too much, but since the people all showed such regard for the roses, they would do the same. \"Twit!\" they said, and swept the ground with their tails, with one eye on the roses. They did not look at them long before they were convinced that they were their old neighbors, and so they really were. The artist who had sketched the rosebush near the charred ruins of the house had later obtained permission to transplant it, and had then given it to the architect of the Museum, for lovelier roses could not be found; and the architect had planted it on Thorvalsden's grave, where, as a living symbol of the beautiful, it blossomed and gave its red, fragrant petals to be carried as remembrances to foreign lands.\n\n\"Have you got an establishment in town now?\" asked the sparrows. And the roses nodded; they recognized their gray neighbors, and were so glad to see them.\n\n\"How wonderful it is to live and blossom here, and to see old friends and kind faces every day! It is as if every day were a big holiday!\"\n\n\"Twit!\" said the sparrows. \"Yes, they are our old neighbors. We remember them from the duckpond! Twit! How they have been honored! But then some people are while they're asleep. And what there is so wonderful in a red lump like that, I don't know! Ah, there's a withered leaf, for that I can see!\"\n\nSo they pecked at the leaf until it fell off, but it only made the rose tree look fresher and greener. And the roses bloomed fragrantly in the sunshine on the grave of Thorvaldsen, with whose immortal name their beauty thus became linked."

Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for you, Daddy.”\n\nThe man was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger flared again when he found out the box was empty. He yelled at her, stating, “Don’t you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside? The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried, “Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They’re all for you, Daddy.”\n\nThe father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness.\n\nOnly a short time later, an accident took the life of the child.

      "body": "The Giving Tree:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a big mango tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the mangoes, took a nap under the shadow… He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him. Time went by, The little boy grew, and he no longer played around the tree. \nOne day, the boy came back to the tree with a sad look on his face. “Come and play with me,” the tree asked the boy. “I am no longer a kid, I don’t play around trees anymore.” The boy replied, “I want toys. I need money to buy them.” “Sorry, I don’t have money… but you can pick all my mangoes and sell them so you will have money.” The boy was so excited. He picked all the mangoes on the tree and left happily. The boy didn’t come back. The tree was sad. \n\nOne day, the boy grown into a man returned. The tree was so excited. “Come and play with me,” the tree said. “I don’t have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?” “Sorry, I don’t have a house, but you can chop off my branches to build your house.” So the man cut all the branches off the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy didn’t come back afterward. The tree was again lonely and sad. \n\nOne hot summer day, the man returned and the tree was delighted. “Come and play with me!” The tree said. “I am sad and getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?” “Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy.” So the man cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and didn’t come back for a long time. \nFinally, the man returned after he had been gone for so many years. “Sorry, my boy, but I don’t have anything for you anymore. No more mangoes to give you.” The tree said. “I don’t have teeth to bite,” the man replied. “No more trunk for you to climb on.” “I am too old for that now,” the man said. \n\n“I really can’t give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots,” the tree said with sadness. “I don’t need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years,” the man replied. “Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest. Come sit down with me and rest.” The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled.\nMoral:The tree in the story represents our parents. When we areyoung, we love to play with them. When we growup, we leavethem and only come back when we need help. Parents sacrifice their lives for us. Never Forget their sacrifices. Give them Love and Care before its too late."

      "body": "The Wooden Bowl:\n\nA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather’s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth. \n\nThe son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about father,” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.” So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced in Grandfather’s direction, sometime he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. \n\nThe four-year-old watched it all in silence. \n\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work . \n\nThe words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. \n\nThat evening the husband took Grandfather’s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.\n\nMoral:You reap what you sow. Regardless of your relationship with your parents, you’ll miss them when they’re gone from your life. Always Respect, Care for and Love them."

      "body": "The Great Sea Serpent:\n\nThere was a little sea fish of good family, the name of which I don't remember; that the more learned will have to tell you. This little fish had eighteen hundred brothers and sisters, all the same age; they didn't know their father or mother, so they had to care for themselves and swim about on their own, but that was a lot of fun. They had plenty of water to drink - the entire ocean. They didn't think about their food; that was sure to come their way. Each did as he pleased; each would have his own story, but then none of them thought about that.\n\nThe sun shone down into the water, making it light and clear. It was a world full of the strangest creatures, some of them enormously big, with great, horrible mouths that could sallow all the eighteen hundred brothers and sisters, but none of them thought about that, either, for none of them had ever been swallowed.\n\nThe little ones swam together, close to one another, as the herring and the mackerel swim. As they were swimming along at their best and thinking of nothing in particular, there sank from above, down into the midst of them, with a terrifying noise, a long, heavy thing which seemed to have no end to it; further and further it stretched out, and every one of the small fish that it struck was crushed or got a crack from which he couldn't recover. All the fishes, the small and the big as well, were thrown into a panic. That heavy, horrible thing sank deeper and deeper and grew longer and longer, extending for miles - through the entire ocean. Fishes and snails, everything that swims, everything that creeps or is driven by the currents, saw this fearful thing, this enormous unknown sea eel that all of a sudden had come from above.\n\nWhat kind of thing was it? Yes, we know! It was the great telegraph cable that people were laying between Europe and America.\n\nThere were great fear and commotion among all the rightful inhabitants of the ocean where the cable was laid. The flying fish shot up above the surface as high as he could, and the blowfish sped off like a gunshot across the water, for it can do that; other fishes went to the bottom of the ocean with such haste that they reached it long before the telegraph cable was seen down there, and they scared both the codfish and the flounder, who lived peacefully at the bottom of the ocean and ate their neighbors. A couple of the starfish were so frightened that they turned their stomachs inside out, but in spite of that they lived, for they can do that. Many of the lobsters and crabs got out of their fine shells and had to leave their legs behind.\n\nIn all this fright and confusion, the eighteen hundred brothers and sisters had all become separated, never again to know or even meet each other, excepting ten of them who had remained at the same place; and after these had held themselves still for a couple of hours, they recovered from their first fright and began to be curious. They looked about; they looked up and they looked down, and there in the deep they thought they saw the frightful thing that had scared them, scared everyone, big and little. There it lay along the bottom of the ocean, extending as far as they could see; it was quite thin, but then they didn't know how thick it could make itself or how strong it was. It lay very quiet, but that, they thought, could be a trick.\n\n\"Let it lie where it is! It doesn't concern us,\" said the most cautious of the little fish.\n\nBut the very smallest one of them insisted on gaining some knowledge as to what that thing might be. It had come down from above, so above one could best find out about it.\n\nAnd so they swam up to the surface, where there was calm weather. There they met a dolphin, which is a sort of jumping jack, an ocean rover, that can turn somersaults in the water. As these have eyes to see with, he must have seen what had happened and should know all about it. They inquired, but the dolphin had only been thinking of himself and his somersaults, had seen nothing, and didn't know what to answer, so he kept quiet and looked proud.\n\nThereupon they turned to the seal who had just ducked down; he was more polite, although seals eat small fishes, for today he had had his fill. He knew a little more than the dolphin.\n\n\"Many a night I have rested on a wet rock and looked far inland, miles away from here; there live some sneaky creatures who, in their language, are called people; they plot against us, but often we slip away from them, which I know how to do, and that is what the sea eel has done, too. He has been in their power, up there on the earth, for a long, long time, and from there they carried him off on a ship, to bring him across the ocean to a distant land. I saw what trouble they had, but they could manage him, because he had become weak on the earth. They laid him down in coils and circles; I heard how he 'ringled' and 'rangled' when they put him down, but still he got away from them. They held on to him with all their might; many hands held fast, but still he slipped away from them and reached the bottom; there he lies now, for a while at least, I think.\"\n\n\"He is rather thin!\" said all the little fish.\n\n\"They have starved him,\" said the seal, \"but he will soon be himself again, fat and big around. I suppose he is the great sea serpent that people are so afraid of and talk so much about. I had never seen him before and never believed he existed, but now I do; I'm sure he's the sea serpent!\" And with that the seal dove down.\n\n\"How much he knew! How much he talked!\" said all the little fish. \"We have never been so enlightened before! If only it isn't all a lie!\"\n\n\"We could swim down and investigate,\" said the smallest fish. \"On the way, we can hear what others think about it.\"\n\n\"We're not going to move a fin to find out anything more!\" said the others, and swam away.\n\n\"But I'm going to,\" said the smallest, and plunged down into deep water.\n\nBut the little fish was a considerable distance from the place where \"that long sunken thing\" lay. He looked and searched in a direction down in the deep water. Never before had he imagined the world to be so big. The herring swam in great masses, each school of them shining like a mighty boat of silver; the mackerel also swam together and looked even more magnificent. There were fishes of all shapes and with markings in all colors. Jellyfish, like half-transparent flowers, simply lay back and let the currents carry them along. Great plants grew up from the bottom of the ocean, as did fathom-high grass and palm-shaped trees, every leaf beset with shining shellfish.\n\nAt last the little fish saw a long, dark streak way down and swam toward it; but it was neither fish nor cable; it was the gunwale of a large sunken vessel, the upper and lower decks of which had been broken in two by the force of the ocean. The little fish swam inside, where the many people who had perished with the sinking of the ship had since been washed away, except for two - young woman lay stretched out with a little child in her arms. The water rocked them to and fro, and they seemed to be asleep. The little fish became quite frightened, for he didn't know that they never again could awaken. Seaweed hung like cultivated foliage over the rail above the fair forms of mother and child. It was so quiet there, so lonely. The little fish hurried away as fast as he could, out to where the water was clearer and there were fishes to see. He hadn't gone far when he met a young and terribly large whale.\n\n\"Don't swallow me!\" said the little fish. \"I'm so small that I'm not even a tiny bite, and it's a great pleasure for me to live!\"\n\n\"What do you want way down here, where your kind never comes?\" asked the whale.\n\nSo the little fish told of the strange long eel, or whatever that thing was, which had sunk and scared even the most courageous of ocean creatures.\n\n\"Ho, ho!\" said the whale, and drew in such a lot of water that he had to make an enormous waterspout when he came to the surface for a breath. \"Ho, ho!\" he said, \"so that was the thing that tickled my back when I turned around! I thought it was a ship's mast that I could use for a back-scratcher! However, it wasn't in this location; no, that thing is much farther out. I'll investigate it, though; I have nothing else to do.\"\n\nAnd so he swam forth, the little fish following, but not too close, for there would be a powerful stream where the big whale shot through the water.\n\nThey met a shark and an old sawfish. These two had also heard of the strange sea eel that was so long and thin; they hadn't seen it, but they wanted to.\n\nThen a catfish appeared. \"I'm coming with you!\" he said, and took the same course. \"If the great sea serpent isn't thicker than a cable, then I'll bite it in two with one bite!\" And he opened his mouth and showed his six rows of teeth. \"I can bite dents in a ship's anchor, so I can easily bite through that stem!\"\n\n\"There it is!\" said the big whale. \"I can see it!\" He thought he saw better than the others. \"See how it rises, see how it sways, bends, and curves!\"\n\nHowever, this was not the sea serpent, but an exceptionally large eel, who was many yards long, and came closer.\n\n\"I've seen him before,\" said the sawfish. \"He's never made much fuss in the ocean here or frightened any big fishes.\"\n\nAnd so they talked to him about the new eel and asked if he wanted to join them on their voyage of discovery.\n\n\"If that eel is longer than I,\" said the sea eel, \"then something unfortunate will happen.\"\n\n\"That it will!\" said the others. \"There are enough of us not to have to tolerate it.\" And then they hurried along.\n\nBut now, directly in their way, there appeared a strange monster, bigger than them all. It looked like a floating island that could not hold itself up. It was a very old whale. His head was overgrown with seaweed, his back beset with barnacles and so many oysters and mussels that his black skin was entirely covered with white spots.\n\n\"Come along, old fellow,\" they said. \"A new fish has come that we will not tolerate!\"\n\n\"I'd rather lie where I am,\" said the old whale. \"Leave me in peace. Let me lie. Oh, my, oh, my! I suffer from a dreadful sickness. The only relief I have is when I go up to the surface and get my back above it; then the big, nice birds come and pick at me, and that feels so good, as long they don't drive their beaks in too far; often they go right into my blubber. Just see for yourself! There is a complete skeleton of a bird stuck in my back. That bird struck his claws in too deep and couldn't get loose when I went down to the bottom. Now the little fishes have eaten him. Just see how he looks, and how I look! I have a sickness!\"\n\n\"That's just imagination!\" said the other whale. \"I am never sick. No fish is sick!\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon!\" said the old whale. \"The eel has a skin disease, the carp has smallpox, and all of us have intestinal worms!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said the shark, and didn't care to hear more; nor did the others; they had something else to do.\n\nFinally, they came to the place where the telegraph cable lay. It had a very long resting place indeed at the bottom of the ocean, from Europe to America, over sandbanks and sea mud, rocky formations and sea-plant wilderness, and, yes, entire forests of coral. The currents down there change, and whirlpools twist around; fishes crowd each other and swim in flocks greater than the countless multitudes of birds that people see when birds of passage are in flight. There are a commotion, a splashing, a humming, and a rushing; a little of that rushing still remains to haunt the big, empty conch shells when we hold them to our ears.\n\nYes, now they came to the place.\n\n\"There lies the animal!\" said the big fishes, and the little one said so, too.\n\nThey saw the cable, its beginning and end beyond their horizon. Sponges, polyps, and seaweed swayed from the ground, rising and falling over the cable, so that now it was hidden and then visible again. Sea porcupines, snails, and worms moved over it. Gigantic spiders, with whole fringes of vermin on them, crawled along the cable. Dark-blue \"sea sausages,\" or whatever the creatures are called that eat with their entire bodies, lay beside it and smelled this new animal that had come down to lie at the bottom of the ocean. Flounders and codfish turned about in the water, in order to hear what was said from all sides. The starfish, who could hold himself down in the mud and keep his eyes outside, lay and stared to see what would come of all this confusion. The telegraph cable lay motionless. But life and thought were in it; human thoughts went through it.\n\n\"That thing is cunning,\" said the whale. \"It's able to hit me in the stomach, and that's my weak point!\"\n\n\"Let's feel our way,\" said a polyp. \"I have long arms; I have limber fingers. I have touched it. Now I'll feel it a little more firmly.\" And then he stretched his longest and most flexible arms down to the cable and around it. \"It has no scales!\" said the polyp. \"It has no skin! I don't believe it will ever bear young ones!\"\n\nThe sea eel laid down alongside the telegraph cable and stretched himself as far as he could. \"That thing is longer than I am!\" he said. \"But it isn't length that counts; one must have skin, stomach, and flexibility! The whale - that is, the young, strong whale - dove down deeper than he ever had been. \"Are you a fish or a plant?\" he asked the cable. \"Or are you only some piece of work from above that can't thrive down here among us?\"\n\nBut the telegraph cable didn't answer; it had no means of contacting anyone at such a location. Thoughts were going through it, people's thoughts, which in a single second were heard from land to land, many hundreds of miles apart.\n\n\"Will you answer, or do you want to be broken?\" asked the fierce shark, and all the other big fishes asked the same. \"Will you answer, or do you want to be broken?\"\n\nThe cable didn't move, but it had its own private thoughts, which it had a right to have, considering that it was filled with other's thoughts. \"Let them break me; then I'll be hauled up and put in order again - that has happened to others of my kind who were in shallower waters.\" And so it didn't answer; it had something else to do; it telegraphed and thereby did its just duty at the bottom of the sea.\n\nUp above, the sun was going down, as people say. It blazed like the reddest fire, and all the clouds in the heavens glowed with a fiery hue, each more magnificent than the other.\n\n\"Now we're getting the red lighting,\" said the polyps, \"and we may be able to see the thing better, if necessary.\"\n\n\"At it! At it!\" shouted the shark, showing all his teeth.\n\n\"At it! At it!\" said the swordfish, and the whale, and the sea eel. They rushed forward, the shark leading, but just as he was about to bite the cable, the swordfish, out of pure anxiety, ran his saw right into the back of the shark; that was a great mistake, and the shark had no strength left to bite. Everything became muddled in the mud. Big fishes, little fishes, \"sea sausages,\" and snails ran into one another, ate each other - clashed and gnashed. The cable lay still and attended to its own business, as one should do.\n\nThe dark night brooded above; but in the ocean the millions and millions of small living creatures lighted it. Crawfish, not even as big as a pinhead, gave out light. It is quite wondrous, but now that's the way it is.\n\nThe ocean creatures looked at the telegraph cable. \"What is that thing, and what isn't it?\" Yes, that was the question.\n\nPresently an old sea cow appeared. People call these mermaids or mermen. This one was a she, and had a tail and two short arms to splash with; she wore seaweed and parasites over her breasts and head, and she was proud of this.\n\n\"Are you seeking knowledge and wisdom?\" she said. \"I am the only one who can give you this; but in return I demand that you guarantee safe pasturage on the bottom of the ocean for me and mine. I am a fish like you are, but I am also a crawling animal, through practice. I am the wisest in the ocean; I know about everything that moves down here and about all that goes on up above. That thing you are pondering over is from above, and whatever falls down from up there is dead, or will be dead, and powerless; let it lie there for what it is. It's only a man-made invention.\n\n\"I believe there is more to it than that!\" said the little fish.\n\n\"Hold your tongue, mackerel!\" said the big sea cow.\n\n\"Stickleback!\" said the others, and that was even more insulting.\n\nAnd the sea cow explained further to them that this alarming thing, which, as a matter of fact, hadn't uttered a single sound, was in its entirety nothing more than some new device from the dry land, and she delivered a little lecture about people's deceitfulness. \"They want to catch us,\" she said; \"that's all they live for. They stretch out nets for us, and come with bait on hooks to tempt us. That thing there is some sort of big string that they think we are going to bite. They are so stupid! But we are not! Don't touch that junk; in time it will unravel and all turn to dust and mud. Everything that comes from up there cracks and breaks - is good for nothing!\"\n\n\"Good for nothing!\" said the other ocean creatures, and held onto the sea cow's opinion, so as to have an opinion.\n\nThe little fish, however, had his own thoughts. \"Perhaps that enormously long, thin serpent is the most wonderful fish in the ocean. I have a feeling it is.\"\n\n\"The most wonderful,\" say we humans, too, and we say it with knowledge and assurance.\n\nThe great sea serpent has long been the theme of song and story. It was conceived and born by man's ingenuity and laid on the bottom of the ocean, stretching from the eastern to the western lands, and carrying messages as swiftly as light flashes from the sun to our earth. It grows, grows in power and length, grows year after year, through all oceans, around the world; it is beneath the stormy seas and the glass-clear waters, where the skipper, as if sailing through transparent air, looks down and sees crowds of fishes resembling many -colored fireworks.\n\nDeepest down of all lies the outstretched serpent, a blessed Midgard snake, which bites its own tail as it encircles the earth. Fishes and other sea creatures clash with it; they do not understand that thing from above. People's thoughts rush noiselessly, in all languages, through the serpent of science, for both good and evil; the most wondrous of the ocean's wonders is our time's ."

      "body": "The Happy Family:\n\nThe biggest leaf we have in this country is certainly the burdock leaf. If you hold one in front of your little stomach, it's just like a real apron; and in rainy weather, if you lay it on your head, it does almost as well as an umbrella. It's really amazingly large. Now, a burdock never grows alone; no, when you see one you'll always see others around it. It's a splendid sight; and all this splendor is nothing more than food for snails-the big white snails which the fine people in olden days used to have made into fricassees. When they had eaten them, they would smack their lips and say, \"My! How good that is!\" For somehow they had the idea that the snails tasted delicious. You see, these snails lived on the burdock leaves, and that's why the burdock was first grown.\n\nThere was a certain old manor house where the people didn't eat snails any more. The snails had almost died out, but the burdock hadn't. These grew and grew on all the walks and flower beds-they couldn't be stopped-until the whole place was a forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple or a plum tree, but except for that, people wouldn't have thought there had ever been a garden there. Everywhere was burdock, and among the burdocks lived the last two incredibly old snails!\n\nThey themselves didn't know how old they were, but they could remember very clearly that once there had been a great many more of them, that they had descended from a prominent foreign family, and they knew perfectly well that the whole forest had been planted just for them and their family.\n\nThey had never been away from home, but they did know that somewhere there was something called a manor house, and that there you were boiled until you turned black, and were laid on a silver dish; but what happened afterwards they hadn't the least idea. Furthermore, they couldn't imagine what it would be like to be boiled and laid on a silver dish, but everyone said it must be very wonderful and a great distinction. Neither the cockchafer nor the toad nor the earthworm, whom they asked about it, could give them any information. None of their families had ever been boiled or laid on silver dishes.\n\nSo the old white snails knew they were by far the most important people in the world. The forest was there just for their sake, and the manor house existed just so that they could be boiled and laid on silver dishes!\n\nThe two old snails led a quiet and happy life, and since they were childless they had adopted a little orphan snail, which they were bringing up as their own child. He wouldn't grow very large, for he was only a common snail; but the two old snails - and especially the mother snail-thought it was easy to see how well he was growing. And she begged the father snail to touch the little snail's shell, if he couldn't see it, and so he felt it and found that she was right.\n\nOne day it rained very hard.\n\n\"Just listen to it drum on the burdock leaves!\" cried Father Snail. \"Rum-dum-dum! Rum-dum-dum!\"\n\n\"Drops are also coming down here\"! said the mother. \"It's coming straight down the stalks, and it'll be wet down here before you know it. I'm certainly glad we have our own good houses and the little one has his own. We're better off than any other creatures; it's quite plain that we're the most important people in the world. We have our own houses from our very birth, and the burdock forest has been planted just for us. I wonder how far it extends, and what lies beyond it.\"\n\n\"There can't be anything beyond,\" said Father Snail, \"that's any better than we have here. I have nothing in the world to wish for.\"\n\n\"Well, I have,\" said the mother. \"I'd like to be taken to the manor house and boiled and laid on a silver dish. All our ancestors had that done to them, and, believe me, it must be something quite uncommon!\"\n\n\"Maybe the manor house has fallen to pieces,\" suggested Father Snail. \"Or perhaps the burdock forest has grown over it, so that the people can't get out at all. Don't be in such a hurry-but then you're always hurrying so. And the little one is beginning to do the same thing. Why, he's been creeping up that stalk for three days. It really makes my head dizzy to watch him go!\"\n\n\"Don't scold him,\" said Mother Snail. \"He crawls very carefully. He'll bring us much joy, and we old folk don't have anything else to live for. But have you ever thought where we can find a wife for him? Don't you think there might be some more of our kind of people farther back in the burdock woods?\"\n\n\"I suppose there may be black snails back there,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Black snails without houses! Much too vulgar! And they're conceited, anyway. But let's ask the ants to find out for us; they're always running around as if they had important business. They're sure to know of a wife for our little snail.\"\n\n\"Certainly, I know a very beautiful bride,\" said one of the ants. \"But I don't think she'd do, because she's a queen!\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter,\" said Mother Snail emphatically. \"Does she have a house?\"\n\n\"She has a castle!\" replied the ant. \"The most beautiful ant's castle, with seven hundred corridors!\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Mother Snail, \"but our boy shall not go into an anthill! If you don't know of anything better, we'll ask the white gnats to find out for us. They flit around in the rain and sunshine, and they know this forest inside and out.\"\n\n\"We have just the wife for him,\" said the gnats. \"A hundred man-steps from here a little snail with a house is sitting on a gooseberry bush. She is all alone in the world, and quite old enough to marry. It's only a hundred man-steps from here!\"\n\n\"Fine, but she must come to him,\" said the old couple. \"Our child has a whole burdock forest, and she has only a bush.\"\n\nAnd so the gnats had the little maiden snail come over. It took her eight days to get there, but that was the wonderful part of it-for it showed she had the right sort of dignity.\n\nAnd then they had a fine wedding! Six glow-worms lighted up the place as well as they could, but aside from that it was a very quiet ceremony, for the old people did not care for feasting or merriment. A charming speech was made by Mother Snail, but Father Snail couldn't say a word; he was too deeply moved. And so she gave the young couple the whole burdock forest for a dowry, and repeated what she had always said-that it was the finest place in the world, and that the young people, if they lived honorably and had many children, would someday be taken with their young ones to the manor house, to be boiled black and laid on a silver dish. And when Mother Snail's speech was finished, the old people crept into their houses and never came out again, for they went to sleep.\n\nNow the young couple ruled the forest and did have many children. But since none of them were ever boiled and laid in silver dishes, they decided that the manor house must have fallen into ruins and that all the people in the world had died out. And since nobody contradicted them, I think they must have been right. So the rain beat on the burdock leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone, to color the forest for them; and they were very happy. The whole family was happy-extremely happy, indeed they were."

      "body": "The White Elephant:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a herd of eighty thousand elephants at the bottom of the majestic Himalayas. Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself. \n Each day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day. He was absolutely disgusted with his herd. \n\nThen one day, he decided to leave them all behind and disappeared in the middle of the night along with his dear mother. He took her to Mount Candorana to live in a cave beside a beautiful lake that was covered by gorgeous pink lotuses. \n It so happened that one day, when the white elephant was feeding he heard loud cries. A forester from Benaras had lost his way in the forest and was absolutely terrified. He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out. \n\nOn seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out. \n The elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to Benaras. \n\nOn reaching the city, he heard that King Brahmadutta’s personal elephant had just died and the King was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a King should come forward with the information. \n\nThe forester was very excited and immediately went up to the King and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on Mount Candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant. \n The King was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother’s meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the King’s men to him. He was very upset at the ingratitude but decided that if he put up a struggle many of the men would be killed. And he was just too kind to hurt anyone. So he decided to go along with them to Benaras and then request the benevolent King to be set free. \n\nThat night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the King’s men had taken away her son. She was scared that the King would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed. She was also worried that there would be no one to look after her or even feed her, as she could not see. She just lay down and cried bitterly. \n\nMeanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of Benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent. \n\nThe worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their King, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The King was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. He offered the elephant food from the royal table and asked him why he grieved in this manner. He thought that the elephant should be proud and honored that he was chosen as the state elephant and would get the opportunity to serve his King. \n\nBut the white elephant replied that he would not eat a thing until he met his mother. So the King asked him where his mother was. The elephant replied that she was back home on Mount Candorana and must be worried and hungry as she was blind and had no one to feed her and take care of her. He was afraid that she would die. \n\nThe compassionate King was touched by the elephant’s story and asked him to return to his blind, old mother and take care of her as he had been doing all along. He set him free in love and kindness. The happy elephant went running home as fast as he could. And he was relieved to find that his mother was still alive. He filled his trunk with water and poured it over his sick mother who thought that it was raining. Then she cried out as she thought that some evil spirit had come to harm her and wished and prayed that her son was there to save her. \n\nThe white elephant gently bent over his blind mother and stroked her lovingly. She immediately recognized his touch and was overjoyed. Her son lifted her up and told her that the kind and compassionate King of Benaras had set him free and he was here to love and look after his mother forever. \n\nHis mother was absolutely thrilled and blessed the kind King with peace, prosperity and joy till the end of his days. She was so thankful to him for sending her son back home. The white elephant was able to take good care of his mother till the day she died. And when he died himself, the King erected a statue of him by the side of the lake and held an annual elephant festival there in memory of such a caring and noble soul.\n\nMoral: Always give affection and care to our dear ones. Always respect other’s feelings."

Other diners watched him in disgust while his son was calm. \n\nAfter he finished eating, his son who was not at all embarrassed, quietly took him to the wash room, wiped the food particles, removed the stains, combed his hair and fitted his spectacles firmly.

Well listen first to what little Marie said.\n\nIt was little Marie's birthday, the most wonderful of all days, she imagined. All her little boy friends and girl friends came to play with her, and she wore her prettiest dress, the one Grandmother, who was now with God, had sewn for her before she went up into the bright, beautiful heaven. \n\nThe table in little Marie's room was loaded with presents; there was the prettiest little kitchen, with everything that belongs to a kitchen, and a doll that could close its eyes and say \"Ouch!\" when you pinched its stomach; yes, and there was also a picture book, with the most wonderful stories, to be read when one could read! But to have many birthdays was more wonderful than all the stories in the book.\n\n\"Yes, it's wonderful to be alive,\" said little Marie. And her godfather added that it was the most beautiful of all fairy tales.\n\nIn the next room were both her brothers; they were big boys, one of them nine years old, the other eleven. They thought it was wonderful to be alive, too; that is, to live in their own way, not to be a baby like Marie, but to be real smart schoolboys, to get A's on their report cards, to have friendly fights with their comrades, to go skating in the winter and bicycling in the summer, to read about the days of knighthood, with its castles, its drawbridges, and its dungeons, and to hear about new discoveries in Central Africa.\n\n On the latter subject, however, one of the boys felt very sad in that he feared everything might be discovered before he grew up, and then there would be no adventure left for him. But Godfather said, \"Life itself is the most wonderful adventure, and you have a part in it yourself.\"\n\nThese children lived on the first floor of the house; in the flat above them lived another branch of the family, also with children, but these all had long since been shaken from their mother's apron strings, so big were they; one son was seventeen, and another twenty, but the third one was very old, said little Marie; he was twenty-five, and engaged to be married. \n\nThey were all very well off, had nice parents, good clothes, and were well educated, and they knew what they wanted. \"Look forward,\" they said. \"Away with all the old fences! Let's have an open view into the wide world! That's the greatest thing we know of! Godfather is right - life is the most wonderful fairy tale!\"\n\nFather and Mother, both older people - naturally, they would have to be older than the children - said, with smiling lips and smiling eyes and hearts, \"How young these young people are! Things usually don't happen in this world just as they expect them to, yet life goes on. Life is a strange and wonderful adventure.\"\n\nOn the next floor - a little closer to heaven, as we say when people live in an attic - lived Godfather. He was old, and yet so young in mind, always in a good humor, and he certainly could tell stories, many and long ones. He had traveled the world over, and his room was filled with pretty tokens from every country. Pictures were hung from ceiling to floor, and some of the windowpanes were of red or yellow glass; if one looked through them, the whole world lay in sunshine, however gray the weather might be outside. Green plants grew in a large glass case, and in an enclosure therein swam goldfish; they looked at one as if they knew many things they didn't care to talk about.\n\n There was always a sweet fragrance of flowers, even in the wintertime. And then a great fire blazed in the fireplace; it was such a pleasure to sit and look into it and hear how it crackled and spat.\n\n\"It refreshes old memories to me, \" said Godfather. And to little Marie there seemed to appear many pictures in the fire.\n\nBut in the big bookcase close by stood real books; one of these Godfather often read, and this he called the Book of Books; it was the Bible. In it was pictured the history of the world and the history of all mankind, of the creation, the flood, the kings, and the King of Kings.\n\n\"All that has happened and all that will happen is written in this book,\" said Godfather; \"so infinitely much in one single book! Just think of it! Yes, everything that a human being has to pray for is entered there, and said in a few words in the prayer 'Our Father'! It is the drop of mercy! It is the pearl of comfort from God. It is laid as a gift on the baby's cradle, laid on the child's heart. Little child, keep it safely; don't ever lose it, however big you may grow, and you will never be left alone on life's changeful way; it will shine within you and you will never be lost!\"\n\nGodfather's eyes radiated joy. Once, in his youth, they had wept, \"and this was also good,\" he said. \"That was a time of trial, when everything looked dark and gray. Now I have sunshine within me and around me. The older one grows, the clearer one sees, in both prosperity and misfortune, that our Lord always is with us and that life is the most beautiful of all fairy tales, and this He alone can give us - and so it will be into eternity.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is wonderful to be alive!\" said little Marie.\n\nSo said also the small and the big boys, as well as Father and Mother and the whole family - but first of all, Godfather, who had had so much experience and was the oldest of them all. He knew all stories, all the fairy tales. And it was right from the bottom of his heart that he said, \"Life is the most wonderful fairy tale of all!\""

When they had done so, he placed the fagot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the fagot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke them easily.

The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather’ s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped, the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth. \n\nThe son and daughter-in- law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about Grandfather, ” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.” So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl. When the family glanced in Grandfather’ s direction, sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence. \n\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. \n That evening the husband took Grandfather’ s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.\n\nMoral: Children are remarkably perceptive. Their eyes ever observe, their ears ever listen, and their minds ever process the messages they absorb. If they see us patiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members, they will imitate that attitude for the rest of their lives. The wise parent realizes that every day the building blocks are being laid for the child’s future. Let’s be wise builders and role models. Because Children are our future.

Then the little boy turned to me and asked, Uncle, are you sure I don’t have enough money? \nI counted his cash and replied, You know that you don’t have enough money to buy the doll, my dear. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give this doll to. It’s the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much . I wanted to Gift her for her Birthday. I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there. His eyes were so sad while saying this. \n\nMy Sister has gone to be with God. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister. My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said, I told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet. I need her to wait until I come back from the mall. Then he showed me a very nice photo of him, where he was laughing. He then told me I want mommy to take my picture with her so my sister won’t forget me, I love my mommy and I wish she doesn’t have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister. \n\nThen he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly. I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. Suppose we check again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll? He said, OK, I hope I do have enough. I added some of my money to his with out him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some spare money. \nThe little boy said, Thank you God for giving me enough money!

The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. \n\nThe family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma. Was this the family of the little boy? Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the news paper that the young woman had passed away. I couldn’t stop myself. I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wishes before her burial. She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed for ever… \n\nThe love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine.

It’s truly a God gift!” roared the lion. “I can listen to this forever,” said the fox. “This voice is pure pleasure,” roared the leopard.\n\nThough the cuckoo was well loved, the other birds did not like him. They grew jealous of the cuckoo’s popularity. “This cuckoo is becoming very popular. It is not good for us,” said vulture. “But, what can we do?” asked the pigeon. “That’s easy! We are many and that cuckoo is just one. All of us can easily drive him away out of the jungle,” crowed the crow. “Yes, let’s do that!” chirped the sparrow. Soon, they all set off to hoosh away the poor cuckoo. So, the other birds did their evil deeds. They drove the poor cuckoo away from the jungle.\n\nBut the real problem started the next day. The animals got agitated. “What happened to the cuckoo’s song today?” roared the lion. “Why is cuckoo not singing? Oh, this afternoon is so boring,” said the fox. “I need some entertainment. I need to do something,” roared the leopard.\n\nAnd then the most horrible thing happened. Without anything else to do, these big animals started to kill the smaller animals for their fun. There was violence all over the jungle. They did not even spare the birds. Those were the same birds that had driven away from the cuckoo bird from the jungle.\n\n“Oh, what a terrible mistake! We should not have driven away the poor cuckoo from the jungle,” cried the vulture. “Since the day little cuckoo had gone, the peace of the jungle had also gone!” crowed the crow. “And now, we all have to pay for our wrong deeds!” cried the pigeon.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: SOONER OR LATER, EVERYONE SITS DOWN TO A BANQUET OF CONSEQUENCES."

      "body": "Love And Time Story:\n\nLong ago, on an island there lived all the feelings called Love, Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all the others.\n\nHowever, one day, it was declared to all the feelings that the island would sink. So, all the feelings got in their constructed boats and began to leave. But Love did not go away. Love was the only one who decided to stay even after hearing the sad news. Love wanted to withstand until the last possible moment.\n\nThe day had finally come. When the island was about to sunk, Love decided to ask for help. Love saw that Richness had a grand boat. Love turned to Richness and asked, “Richness, can you please take me with you?” On hearing this, Richness answered, “No, I cannot. I am carrying heaps of gold and silver in my grand boat. There is no space for you, friend.”\n\nLove then turned to Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, can you please help me!” “I can’t help you, Love. You are completely drenched in water. Because of this, m boat might get damaged. I don’t want to risk my life because of you,” Vanity replied.\n\nSadness was also passing by the same route. So Love asked, “Sadness, Please, help me! Take me along with you.” “Dear Love, I am so sad that I need to be all alone!” So, Sadness also left Love. \n\nHappiness too passed over by Love, but she was so happy that she did not stop to hear even hear what Love was saying. All of a sudden, there Love heard a voice, “Come, my friend Love, I will take you with me.” It was an elderly voice.\n\nLove became so overjoyed that he even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. In a couple of minutes, they arrived at dry land. After that, the elder went his own way to leave Love behind.\n\nRealizing how much he owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Do you know who helped me?” “It was Time,” Knowledge replied. “Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?” Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”\n\nMORAL OF LOVE AND TIME STORY: TIME IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING HOW VALUABLE LOVE REALLY IS."

      "body": "A Soldiers Story:\n\nA story is told about a soldier who was finally coming home after having fought in Vietnam. He called his parents from San Francisco. “Mom and Dad, I’m coming home, but I’ve a favor to ask. I have a friend I’d like to bring home with me. “Sure,” they replied, “we’d love to meet him.” \n\n“There’s something you should know,” the son continued, “he was hurt pretty badly in the fighting. He stepped on a land mind and lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to come live with us.” \n\n“I’m sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.” \n\n“No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.” \n\n“Son,” said the father, “you don’t know what you’re asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can’t let something like this interfere with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He’ll find a way to live on his own.” \n\nAt that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing more from him. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling from a building, they were told. The police believed it was suicide. \n\nThe grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the city morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to their horror they also discovered something they didn’t know, their son had only one arm and one leg. \n\nMoral: The parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don’t like people who inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren’t as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are. Thankfully, there’s someone who won’t treat us that way. Someone who loves us with an unconditional love that welcomes us into the forever family, regardless of how messed up we are. Tonight, before you tuck yourself in for the night, say a little prayer that God will give you the strength you need to accept people as they are, and to help us all be more understanding of those who are different from us!"

      "body": "The Praying Hands:\n\nBack in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood. Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder’s children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.\nAfter many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in the mines.\n\nThey tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht’s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works.\n\nWhen the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht’s triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, “And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.”\n\nAll heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, “No …no …no …no.”\n\nFinally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, “No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look … look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. No, brother … for me it is too late.”\n\nMore than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer’s hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer’s works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.\nOne day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother’s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply “Hands,” but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love “The Praying Hands.”\n \nMora: The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one – no one – ever makes it alone!"

      "body": "A King’s Painting:\n\nA long time ago, there was a Kingdom. In the Kingdom, there lived a king with only one leg and one eye. However, he was very intelligent and kind to his people. Everyone in his kingdom lived a happy and a healthy life because of their king.\nOne day, as the king was walking through the palace hallway, he saw the portraits of his ancestors. He thought that one day his children will walk in the same hallway and remember all the ancestors through these portraits. But, the king did not have his portrait painted. This was so because he wasn’t so sure how his physical disabilities will be portrayed in the painting.\n\nNext day, the King invited famous painters from all across the world. The king said, Ï want a beautiful portrait of me to be placed in the palace. Any painter who can carry out this should come forward. He will be rewarded based on how the painting turns up.”\n\nAll the famous painters thought for a while and stepped back. How can his picture be made very beautiful? He has only one keg and one eye! It is impossible and if the picture does not turn out to look beautiful then the king will get angry and punish us.” So, all the painters started to make excuses one by one and politely said no to make a painting of the king.\n\nSuddenly, one painter raised his hand and said, “I will make a very beautiful portrait of you which you will definitely like, my King.” The king was very happy to hear that. However, the other painters got puzzled and wanted to see what the other painter would make. The king granted him the permission and the painter started to make his portrait. He then filled the portrait with different colors. At last, after a long time, he said, “My King, the portrait was ready!”\n\nAll of the courtiers were very excited to see what that painter has made. When the painter finally presented the portrait, everyone in the court, including the King was stunned.\n\nIn the portrait, the King was sitting on the horse, on the one-leg side, holding his bow and aiming the arrow with his one-eye closed. The king was very pleased to see that the painter has made a beautiful portrait by cleverly hiding his disabilities. The King rewarded him with a lot of gold and gave him the title of “Best Painter of the Kingdom”. \n\nSHORT FABLES WITH MORALS:\nWE SHOULD ALWAYS THINK POSITIVE OF OTHERS AND IGNORE THEIR WEAKNESSES.\nOR\nWE SHOULD LEAR TO FOCUS ON THE GOOD THINGS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HIDE WEAKNESSES.\nOR\nIF WE THINK AND APPROACH POSITIVELY EVEN IN A NEGATIVE SITUATION, THEN WE’LL BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS MORE EFFICIENTLY."

      "body": "Father Son Conversation:\n\nOnce day, father was doing some work and his son came and asked, “Daddy, may I ask you a question?” Father said, “Yeah sure, what it is?” So his son asked, “Dad, how much do you make an hour?” Father got bit upset and said, “That’s none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?” Son said, “I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?” So, father told him that “I make Rs. 500 per hour.” \n\n “Oh”, the little boy replied, with his head down. Looking up, he said, “Dad, may I please borrow Rs. 300?” The father furiously said, “if the only reason you asked about my pay is so that you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or other nonsense, then march yourself to your room and go to bed. Think why you are being so selfish. I work hard every day and do not like this childish behavior.” \n\nThe little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door. The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy’s questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money? After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think, “May be there was something he really needed to buy with that Rs. 300 and he really didn’t ask for money very often!” The man went to the door of little boy’s room and opened the door. “Are you a sleep, son?” He asked. “No daddy, I’m awake,” replied the boy. “I’ve been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier”, said the man. “It’s been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you, Here’s the Rs.300 you asked for”.\n\nThe little boy sat straight up, smiling “oh thank you dad!” He yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled some crippled up notes. The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, then looked up at his father. \n\n“Why do you want money if you already had some?” the father grumbled. “Because I didn’t have enough, but now I do,” the little boy replied. “Daddy I have Rs. 500 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you”. Father was dumbstruck. \n\nMoral: It’s just a short reminder to all of you working so hard in life! We should not let time slip through our fingers without having spent some time with those who really matter to us, those close to our hearts. If we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family &amp; friends we leave behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than to our family."

      "body": "Table Of Grandpa:\n\nA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in- law, and four-year old grandson. The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather’ s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped, the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.\n\nThe son and daughter-in- law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about Grandfather, ” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.” So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl. When the family glanced in Grandfather’ s direction, sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence.\n\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.\n\nThat evening the husband took Grandfather’ s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled."

      "body": "Mothers Sacrifice:\n\nMy mom only had one eye. I hated her… she was such an embarrassment. My mom ran a small shop at a flea market. She collected little weeds and such to sell… anything for the money we needed she was such an embarrassment. There was this one day during elementary school.\n\nI remember that it was field day, and my mom came. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school… “Your mom only has one eye?!” and they taunted me.\n\nI wished that my mom would just disappear from this world so I said to my mom, “Mom, why don’t you have the other eye?! You’re only going to make me a laughingstock. Why don’t you just die?” My mom did not respond. I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I’d wanted to say all this time. Maybe it was because my mom hadn’t punished me, but I didn’t think that I had hurt her feelings very badly.\n\nThat night… I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me. I took a look at her, and then turned away. Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in the corner of my heart. Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out of her one eye. So I told myself that I would grow up and become successful, because I hated my one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty.\nThen I studied really hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul and studied, and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the confidence I had. Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too. Now I’m living happily as a successful man. I like it here because it’s a place that doesn’t remind me of my mom.\n\nThis happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when someone unexpected came to see me “What?! Who’s this?!” It was my mother… Still with her one eye. It felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me. My little girl ran away, scared of my mom’s eye. And I asked her, “Who are you? I don’t know you!!” as if I tried to make that real. I screamed at her “How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter! Get out of here now!!” And to this, my mother quietly answered, “oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,” and she disappeared. Thank goodness… she doesn’t recognize me. I was quite relieved. I told myself that I wasn’t going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life.\n\nThen a wave of relief came upon me… one day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. I lied to my wife saying that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to call a house…just out of curiosity there, I found my mother fallen on the cold ground. But I did not shed a single tear. She had a piece of paper in her hand…. it was a letter to me.\nShe wrote:\n\nMy son, I think my life has been long enough now. And… I won’t visit Seoul anymore… but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to come visit me once in a while? I miss you so much. And I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I decided not to go to the school…. For you… I’m sorry that I only have one eye, and I was an embarrassment for you. You see, when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn’t stand watching you having to grow up with only one eye… so I gave you mine… I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye. I was never upset at you for anything you did. The couple times that you were angry with me. I thought to myself, ‘it’s because he loves me.’ I miss the times when you were still young around me. I miss you so much. I love you. You mean the world to me.\n\nMy World Shattered. I hated the person who only lived for me . I cried for My Mother, I didn’t know of any way that will make up for my worst deeds…\n \nMoral: Never Ever hate anyone for their disabilities. Never disrespect your parents, don’t ignore and under estimate their sacrifices. They give us life, they raise us better than they had been, they give and keep trying to give better than they ever had. They never wish unwell for their kids even in their wildest dreams. They always try showing right path and being motivator. Parents give up all for kids, forgive all mistakes made by kids. There is no way to repay what they done for kids, all we can do is try giving what they need and it is just time, love and respect."
