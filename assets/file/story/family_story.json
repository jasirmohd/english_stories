      "body": "One young academically excellent person went to apply for a managerial position in a big company. He passed the first interview, the director did the last interview, made the last decision. The director discovered from the CV that the youth’s academic achievements were excellent all the way, from the secondary school until the postgraduate research, Never had a year when he did not score.\n\nThe director asked, “Did you obtain any scholarships in school?” The youth answered “none”.\n\nThe director asked, “Was it your father who paid for your school fees?” The youth answered, “My father passed away when I was one year old, it was my mother who paid for my school fees”.\nThe director asked, “Where did your mother work?” The youth answered, “My mother worked as clothes cleaner. The director requested the youth to show his hands. The youth showed a pair of hands that were smooth and perfect”.\n\nThe director asked, “Have you ever helped your mother wash the clothes before?” The youth answered, “Never, my mother always wanted me to study and read more books. Furthermore, my mother can wash clothes faster than me”.\n\nThe director said, “I have a request. When you go back today, go and clean your mother’s hands, and then see me tomorrow morning”.\n\nThe youth felt that his chance of landing the job was high. When he went back, he happily requested his mother to let him clean her hands. His mother felt strange, happy but with mixed feelings, she showed her hands to the kid. The youth cleaned his mother’s hands slowly. His tear fell as he did that. It was the first time he noticed that his mother’s hands were so wrinkled, and there were so many bruises in her hands. Some bruises were so painful that his mother shivered when they were cleaned with water.\n\nThis was the first time the youth realized that it was this pair of hands that washed the clothes everyday to enable him to pay the school fee. The bruises in the mother’s hands were the price that the mother had to pay for his graduation, academic excellence and his future. After finishing the cleaning of his mother’s hands, the youth quietly washed all the remaining clothes for his mother. That night, mother and son talked for a very long time. Next morning, the youth went to the director’s office.\n\nThe Director noticed the tears in the youth’s eyes, asked: “Can you tell me what have you done and learned yesterday in your house?” The youth answered, “I cleaned my mother’s hand, and also finished cleaning all the remaining clothes”.\n\nThe Director asked, “please tell me your feelings”. The youth said, “Number 1, I know now what is appreciation. Without my mother, there would not the successful me today. Number 2, By working together and helping my mother, only I now realize how difficult and tough it is to get something done. Number 3, I have come to appreciate the importance and value of family relationship”.\n\nThe director said, “This is what I am looking for to be my manager. I want to recruit a person who can appreciate the help of others, a person who knows the sufferings of others to get things done, and a person who would not put money as his only goal in life. You are hired”. Later on, this young person worked very hard, and received the respect of his subordinates. Every employee worked diligently and as a team. The company’s performance improved tremendously.\n\nMoral: If one doesn’t understand and experience the difficulty it takes to earn the comfort provided by their loved ones, than they will never value it.The most important thing is to experience the difficulty and learn to value hard work behind all the given comfort.\n\n"

      "title": "A Soldiers Story",
      "body": "A story is told about a soldier who was finally coming home after having fought in Vietnam. He called his parents from San Francisco. “Mom and Dad, I’m coming home, but I’ve a favor to ask. I have a friend I’d like to bring home with me. “Sure,” they replied, “we’d love to meet him.”\n\n“There’s something you should know,” the son continued, “he was hurt pretty badly in the fighting. He stepped on a land mind and lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to come live with us.”\n\n“I’m sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.”\n\n“No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.”\n\n“Son,” said the father, “you don’t know what you’re asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can’t let something like this interfere with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He’ll find a way to live on his own.”\n\nAt that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing more from him. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling from a building, they were told. The police believed it was suicide.\n\nThe grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the city morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to their horror they also discovered something they didn’t know, their son had only one arm and one leg.\n\nMoral: The parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don’t like people who inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren’t as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are. Thankfully, there’s someone who won’t treat us that way. Someone who loves us with an unconditional love that welcomes us into the forever family, regardless of how messed up we are. Tonight, before you tuck yourself in for the night, say a little prayer that God will give you the strength you need to accept people as they are, and to help us all be more understanding of those who are different from us!\n\n"

      "body": "A son took his old father to a restaurant for an evening dinner. Father being very old and weak, while eating, dropped food on his shirt and trousers. Other diners watched him in disgust while his son was calm.\n\nAfter he finished eating, his son who was not at all embarrassed, quietly took him to the wash room, wiped the food particles, removed the stains, combed his hair and fitted his spectacles firmly. When they came out, the entire restaurant was watching them in dead silence, not able to grasp how someone could embarrass themselves publicly like that. The son settled the bill and started walking out with his father.\nAt that time, an old man amongst the diners called out to the son and asked him, “Don’t you think you have left something behind?”.\n\nThe son replied, “No sir, I haven’t”.\n\nThe old man retorted, “Yes, you have! You left a lesson for every son and hope for every father”.\nThe restaurant went silent.\n\nMoral: To care for those who once cared for us is one of the highest honors.  We all know, how our parents cared for us for every little things. Love them, respect them, and care for them.\n\n"

      "body": "A father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion.\n\nOne day he told his sons to bring him a bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the fagot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it. He next opened the fagot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and again put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke them easily. He then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each other, you will be as strong as this fagot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies, but if you are divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.”\n\nMoral: Unity is strength.\n\n"

      "body": "Once day, father was doing some work and his son came and asked, “Daddy, may I ask you a question?” Father said, “Yeah sure, what it is?” So his son asked, “Dad, how much do you make an hour?” Father got bit upset and said, “That’s none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?” Son said, “I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?” So, father told him that “I make Rs. 500 per hour.”\n\n“Oh”, the little boy replied, with his head down. Looking up, he said, “Dad, may I please borrow Rs. 300?” The father furiously said, “if the only reason you asked about my pay is so that you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or other nonsense, then march yourself to your room and go to bed. Think why you are being so selfish. I work hard every day and do not like this childish behavior.”\n\nThe little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door. The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy’s questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money? After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think, “May be there was something he really needed to buy with that Rs. 300 and he really didn’t ask for money very often!” The man went to the door of little boy’s room and opened the door. “Are you a sleep, son?” He asked. “No daddy, I’m awake,” replied the boy. “I’ve been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier”, said the man. “It’s been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you, Here’s the Rs.300 you asked for”.\n\nThe little boy sat straight up, smiling “oh thank you dad!” He yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled some crippled up notes. The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again. The little boy slowly counted out his money, then looked up at his father.\n\n“Why do you want money if you already had some?” the father grumbled. “Because I didn’t have enough, but now I do,” the little boy replied. “Daddy I have Rs. 500 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you”. Father was dumbstruck.\n\nMoral: It’s just a short reminder to all of you working so hard in life! We should not let time slip through our fingers without having spent some time with those who really matter to us, those close to our hearts. If we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family & friends we leave behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than to our family.\n\n"

      "body": "While at the park one day, a woman sat down next to a man on a bench near a playground. “That’s my son over there,” she said, pointing to a little boy in a red sweater who was gliding down the slide. “He’s a fine looking boy” the man said. “That’s my daughter on the bike in the white dress.”\n\nThen, looking at his watch, he called to his daughter. “What do you say we go, Melissa?” Melissa pleaded, “Just five more minutes, Dad. Please? Just five more minutes.” The man nodded and Melissa continued to ride her bike to her heart’s content. Minutes passed and the father stood and called again to his daughter. “Time to go now?”\n\nAgain Melissa pleaded, “Five more minutes, Dad. Just five more minutes.” The man smiled and said, “OK.” “My, you certainly are a patient father,” the woman responded.\n\nThe man smiled and then said, “Her older brother Tommy was killed by a drunk driver last year while he was riding his bike near here. I never spent much time with Tommy and now I’d give anything for just five more minutes with him. I’ve vowed not to make the same mistake with Melissa. She thinks she has five more minutes to ride her bike. The truth is, I get Five more minutes to watch her play.”\n\nMoral: Life is all about making priorities, and family is one and only priority on top of all other, so spend all time you can with loved ones.\n\n"

      "body": "The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for you, Daddy.”\n\nThe man was embarrassed by his earlier overreaction, but his anger flared again when he found out the box was empty. He yelled at her, stating, “Don’t you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside? The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried, “Oh, Daddy, it’s not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They’re all for you, Daddy.”\n\nThe father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness.\n\nOnly a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. It is also told that her father kept that gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.\n\nMoral: In a very real sense, each one of us, as humans beings, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love from our children, family members, friends, and God. There is simply no other possession, anyone could hold, more precious than this.\n\n"

      "title": "Grandpas Table",
      "body": "A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in- law, and four-year old grandson. The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather’ s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped, the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.\n\nThe son and daughter-in- law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about Grandfather, ” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.” So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl. When the family glanced in Grandfather’ s direction, sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence.\n\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.\nThat evening the husband took Grandfather’ s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.\n\nMoral: Children are remarkably perceptive. Their eyes ever observe, their ears ever listen, and their minds ever process the messages they absorb. If they see us patiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members, they will imitate that attitude for the rest of their lives. The wise parent realizes that every day the building blocks are being laid for the child’s future. Let’s be wise builders and role models. Because Children are our future. Life is about people connecting with people, and making a positive difference. Take care of yourself, … and those you love, … today, … and everyday!\n\n"

      "body": "When I was a kid, my Mom liked to make breakfast food for dinner every now and then. And I remember one night in particular when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work. On that evening so long ago, my Mom placed a plate of eggs, sausage and extremely burned biscuits in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone noticed! Yet all dad did was reached for his biscuit, smile at my Mom and ask me how my day was at school. I don’t remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him smear butter and jelly on that biscuit and eat every bite!\n\nWhen I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my Mom apologize to my dad for burning the biscuits. And I’ll never forget what he said: “Honey, I love burned biscuits.”\nLater that night, I went to kiss Daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his biscuits burned. He wrapped me in his arms and said, “Your Momma put in a hard day at work today and she’s real tired. And besides – a little burned biscuit never hurt anyone!”\n\nMoral: Life is full of imperfect things and imperfect people. I’m not the best at hardly anything, and I forget birthdays and anniversaries just like everyone else. But what I’ve learned over the years is that learning to accept each others faults – and choosing to celebrate each others differences – is one of the most important keys to creating a healthy, growing, and lasting relationship. \n\n"

      "title": "Mothers Sacrifice",
      "body": "My mom only had one eye. I hated her… she was such an embarrassment. My mom ran a small shop at a flea market. She collected little weeds and such to sell… anything for the money we needed she was such an embarrassment. There was this one day during elementary school.\n\nI remember that it was field day, and my mom came. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day at school… “Your mom only has one eye?!” and they taunted me.\n\nI wished that my mom would just disappear from this world so I said to my mom, “Mom, why don’t you have the other eye?! You’re only going to make me a laughingstock. Why don’t you just die?” My mom did not respond. I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it felt good to think that I had said what I’d wanted to say all this time. Maybe it was because my mom hadn’t punished me, but I didn’t think that I had hurt her feelings very badly.\n\nThat night… I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake me. I took a look at her, and then turned away. Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in the corner of my heart. Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out of her one eye. So I told myself that I would grow up and become successful, because I hated my one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty.\nThen I studied really hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul and studied, and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the confidence I had. Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too. Now I’m living happily as a successful man. I like it here because it’s a place that doesn’t remind me of my mom.\n\nThis happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when someone unexpected came to see me “What?! Who’s this?!” It was my mother… Still with her one eye. It felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me. My little girl ran away, scared of my mom’s eye. And I asked her, “Who are you? I don’t know you!!” as if I tried to make that real. I screamed at her “How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter! Get out of here now!!” And to this, my mother quietly answered, “oh, I’m so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,” and she disappeared. Thank goodness… she doesn’t recognize me. I was quite relieved. I told myself that I wasn’t going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life.\n\nThen a wave of relief came upon me… one day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. I lied to my wife saying that I was going on a business trip. After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to call a house…just out of curiosity there, I found my mother fallen on the cold ground. But I did not shed a single tear. She had a piece of paper in her hand…. it was a letter to me.\nShe wrote:\n\nMy son, I think my life has been long enough now. And… I won’t visit Seoul anymore… but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to come visit me once in a while? I miss you so much. And I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion. But I decided not to go to the school…. For you… I’m sorry that I only have one eye, and I was an embarrassment for you. You see, when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn’t stand watching you having to grow up with only one eye… so I gave you mine… I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye. I was never upset at you for anything you did. The couple times that you were angry with me. I thought to myself, ‘it’s because he loves me.’ I miss the times when you were still young around me. I miss you so much. I love you. You mean the world to me.\n\nMy World Shattered. I hated the person who only lived for me . I cried for My Mother, I didn’t know of any way that will make up for my worst deeds…\n\nMoral: Never Ever hate anyone for their disabilities. Never disrespect your parents, don’t ignore and under estimate their sacrifices. They give us life, they raise us better than they had been, they give and keep trying to give better than they ever had. They never wish unwell for their kids even in their wildest dreams. They always try showing right path and being motivator. Parents give up all for kids, forgive all mistakes made by kids. There is no way to repay what they done for kids, all we can do is try giving what they need and it is just time, love and respect.\n\n"

I hate to miss doing the garden because your mother always loved planting time. I’m just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. If you were here, all my troubles would be over. I know you would dig the plot for me, if you weren’t in prison. Love, Dad Shortly, the old man received this telegram: ‘For Heaven’s sake, Dad, don’t dig up the garden!! That’s where I buried the GUNS!!’ At 4 a.m. the next morning, a dozen FBI agents and local police officers showed up and dug up the entire garden without finding any guns. Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what had happened, and asked him what to do next. His son’s reply was: ‘Go ahead and plant your potatoes, Dad.

But I only have seventy-five cents, and a rose costs two dollars.”\n\nThe man smiled and said, “Come on in with me.

      "body": "Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood. Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder’s children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.\nAfter many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in the mines.\n\nThey tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht’s etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works.\n\nWhen the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht’s triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, “And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.”\n\nAll heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, “No …no …no …no.”\n\nFinally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, “No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look … look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. No, brother … for me it is too late.”\n\nMore than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer’s hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer’s works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.\nOne day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother’s abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply “Hands,” but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love “The Praying Hands.”\n\nMora: The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one – no one – ever makes it alone!\n\n"

However, to find out whose prayer was more powerful, they agreed to divide the territory between them and stay on opposite sides of the island.\n\nThe first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first man saw a fruit-bearing tree on his side of the land, and he was able to eat its fruit. The other man’s parcel of land remained barren.\n\nAfter a week, the first man was lonely and he decided to pray for a wife. The next day, another ship was wrecked, and the only survivor was a woman who swam to his side of the land. On the other side of the island, there was nothing.\n\nSoon the first man prayed for a house, clothes, more food. The next day, like magic, all of these were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.\n\nFinally, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife could leave the island. In the morning, he found a ship docked at his side of the island. The first man boarded the ship with his wife and decided to leave the second man on the island.\nHe considered the other man unworthy to receive God’s blessings, since none of his prayers had been answered.\n\nAs the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from heaven booming, “Why are you leaving your companion on the island?”\n\n“My blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them,” the first man answered. “His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not deserve anything.”\n\n“You are mistaken!” the voice rebuked him. “He had only one prayer, which I answered. If not for that, you would not have received any of my blessings.”\n\n“Tell me,” the first man asked the voice, “What did he pray for that I should owe him anything?”\n\n“He prayed that all your prayers be answered “\n\nMoral: For all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone, but those of another praying for us (Congregational Prayer).

      "title": "The White Elephant",
      "body": "Once upon a time, there lived a herd of eighty thousand elephants at the bottom of the majestic Himalayas. Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself.\nEach day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day. He was absolutely disgusted with his herd.\n\nThen one day, he decided to leave them all behind and disappeared in the middle of the night along with his dear mother. He took her to Mount Candorana to live in a cave beside a beautiful lake that was covered by gorgeous pink lotuses.\nIt so happened that one day, when the white elephant was feeding he heard loud cries. A forester from Benaras had lost his way in the forest and was absolutely terrified. He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out.\n\nOn seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out.\nThe elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to Benaras.\n\nOn reaching the city, he heard that King Brahmadutta’s personal elephant had just died and the King was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a King should come forward with the information.\n\nThe forester was very excited and immediately went up to the King and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on Mount Candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant.\nThe King was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother’s meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the King’s men to him. He was very upset at the ingratitude but decided that if he put up a struggle many of the men would be killed. And he was just too kind to hurt anyone. So he decided to go along with them to Benaras and then request the benevolent King to be set free.\n\nThat night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the King’s men had taken away her son. She was scared that the King would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed. She was also worried that there would be no one to look after her or even feed her, as she could not see. She just lay down and cried bitterly.\n\nMeanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of Benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent.\n\nThe worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their King, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The King was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. He offered the elephant food from the royal table and asked him why he grieved in this manner. He thought that the elephant should be proud and honored that he was chosen as the state elephant and would get the opportunity to serve his King.\n\nBut the white elephant replied that he would not eat a thing until he met his mother. So the King asked him where his mother was. The elephant replied that she was back home on Mount Candorana and must be worried and hungry as she was blind and had no one to feed her and take care of her. He was afraid that she would die.\n\nThe compassionate King was touched by the elephant’s story and asked him to return to his blind, old mother and take care of her as he had been doing all along. He set him free in love and kindness. The happy elephant went running home as fast as he could. And he was relieved to find that his mother was still alive. He filled his trunk with water and poured it over his sick mother who thought that it was raining. Then she cried out as she thought that some evil spirit had come to harm her and wished and prayed that her son was there to save her.\n\nThe white elephant gently bent over his blind mother and stroked her lovingly. She immediately recognized his touch and was overjoyed. Her son lifted her up and told her that the kind and compassionate King of Benaras had set him free and he was here to love and look after his mother forever.\n\nHis mother was absolutely thrilled and blessed the kind King with peace, prosperity and joy till the end of his days. She was so thankful to him for sending her son back home. The white elephant was able to take good care of his mother till the day she died. And when he died himself, the King erected a statue of him by the side of the lake and held an annual elephant festival there in memory of such a caring and noble soul.\n\nMoral: Always give affection and care to our dear ones. Always respect other’s feelings.\n\n"

      "body": "A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old man’s hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather’s shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.\n\nThe son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about father,” said the son. “I’ve had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor.” So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced in Grandfather’s direction, sometime he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food.\n\nThe four-year-old watched it all in silence.\n\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old smiled and went back to work .\n\nThe words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.\n\nThat evening the husband took Grandfather’s hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.\n\nMoral:You reap what you sow. Regardless of your relationship with your parents, you’ll miss them when they’re gone from your life. Always Respect, Care for and Love them.\n\n"

      "body": "The King Of The Golden Mountain:\n\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth, in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble.\n\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the merchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but I may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left but that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’ said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\n\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\n\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.\n\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel said, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be too much for the little man.’\n\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At last the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what good luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but Heinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to talk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my father,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and softly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money, and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me have what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said Heinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\n\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.\n\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\n\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come: their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour. They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do what they will—beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you—bear all; only speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.\n\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was against his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come upon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived.\n\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that he was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me if I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he had said was true.\n\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant said, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\n\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat himself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger. ‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to my kingdom.’\n\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three giants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly, and in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now give me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also; and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\n\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and drink, her plate and cup were always empty.\n\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said she to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment still seem to bind me?’\n\n‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to have had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him. However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden Mountain."

Despite his enormous physique, he was a very loving creature. People loved him and offered him delicious fruits to eat.\n\nWhile going to temple, the elephant had to pass through a busy market place. There a florist would give him a marigold garland everyday, while a fruit seller would offer him fruits. The elephant was very grateful to both of them for these presents. The people in the market place would gather around the elephant and show their affections by patting him gently. They had a lot of respect in their hearts for him.\n\nOne day, the florist thought of playing a little joke on the elephant.

But the queen said “I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good to our little daughter.”\n\nNow there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom, but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, red shoes with high heels on her feet and a long white wand in her hand. After the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world.\n\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy had come, with a black cap on her head, black shoes on her feet and a broomstick in her hand. She quickly came up into the dining-hall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, scolded the king and queen very much and set to work to take her revenge. So she cried out “The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.”\n\nDisgruntled fairy dressed in black casts spell on Sleeping Beauty who is lying in cot. Anguished king and queen in background with other good fairies.\n\nThen the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years.\n\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil, so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies came true in the meantime, for the princess was so beautiful, well behaved, good and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her.\n\nimages of Sleeping beauty. One as toddler chasing a butterfly, one about 10 years old and then as about 16. Castle in background.\n\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, until at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily.\n\n“Why how now, good mother,” said the princess, “what are you doing there?”\n\n“Spinning,” said the old lady, nodding her head and humming a tune, while the wheel buzzed.\n\n“How prettily that little thing turns round!” said the princess, who took the spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it before the fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled. The spindle wounded her and she fell down lifeless on the ground.\n\nSleeping Beauty pricking finger on spindle black fairy in background.\n\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep. The king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too. The horses slept in the stables, the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top and the very flies slept upon the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing and went to sleep and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still. The cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep. The butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips. And thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\n\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace and every year it became higher and thicker. At last, the old palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping princess, so that, from time to time, several kings’ sons came and tried to break through the thicket into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do, for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands and there they got stuck and could not escape.\n\nAfter many, many years there came a king’s son into that land and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns, how a beautiful palace stood behind it and how a wonderful princess lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it. Then the young prince said, “All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see this sleeping princess.” The old man tried to hinder him, but his mind was made up to go.\n\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs. He got through them with ease and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace and there in the court lay the dogs asleep. The horses were standing in the stables and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls, the spit was standing still, the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, the maid sat with a chicken in her lap ready to be plucked and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy.\n\nHandsome prince walking through palace on his way to find Sleeping Beauty with all the sleeping figures around frozen in position.\n\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew. At last he came to the old tower and opened the door of the little room in which the princess was and there she lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\n\nHandsome prince kissing Sleeping Beauty to wake her up.\n\nBut the moment he kissed her, she opened her eyes and awoke, smiled upon him and they went out together. Soon the king and queen also awoke and all the court and gazed on each other with great wonder. And the horses shook themselves, the dogs jumped up and barked, the pigeons took their heads from under their wings and looked about and flew into the fields, the flies on the walls buzzed again, the fire in the kitchen blazed up, round went the spit, with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his drink of ale, the maid went on plucking the fowl and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.\n\nThe prince and the princess were married, there was a tremendous wedding feast and they lived happily together for the rest of their lives."

      "body": "Hello! Cave:\n\nLong ago, there lived a lion by the name of Kharanakhara. He had been trying to hunt for his prey for the last two days, but could not succeed due to his old age and physical infirmity. He was no longer strong to hunt for his food. He was quite dejected and disappointed. He thought that he would die of strarving. One day, while he was wandering in the jungle hopelessly, he came across a cave. 'There must be some animal who lives in this cave'; so thought the lion. 'I will hide myself inside it and wait for its occupant to enter. And as soon as the occupant enters the cave, I shall kill him and eat his flesh.' Thinking thus, the lion entered the cave and hid himself carefully.\n\nAfter sometime, a fox came near the cave. The cave belonged to her. The fox was surprised to find the foot-marks of a lion poi nting towards the cave. 'Some lion has stealthily entered my cave', he thought to himself. But to make sure of the presence of the lion inside the cave, the fox played upon a trick.\n\nThe fox stood at some distance from the cave to save himself in case of a sudden attack and shouted, \"Hello cave! I've come back. Speak to me as you have been doing earlier. Why're you keeping silent, my dear cave? May I come in and occupy my residence?\"\n\nHearing the fox calling the cave, the lion thought to himself, that the cave he was hiding in, must in reality be a talking cave. The cave might be keeping quiet because of his kingly presence inside. Therefore, if the cave didn't answer to the fox's question, the fox might go away to occupy some other cave and thus, he would have to go without a meal once again.\n\nTrying to be wise, the lion answered in a roaring voice on behalf of the cave, \"I've not forgotten my practice of speaking to you when you come, my dear fox. Come in and be at home, please.\"\n\nThus, the clever fox confirmed the presence of the lion hiding in his cave and ran away without losing a single moment, saying, \"Only a fool would believe that a cave speaks.\"\n\nMoral: Presence of mind is the best weapon to guard oneself in every sphere of life."

      "body": "The Tale Of Benjamin Bunny:\n\nOne morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.\n\nHe pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.\n\nA gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.\n\nAs soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.\n\nThat wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.\n\nOld Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).\n\nLittle Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.\n\nHe came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.\n\nPeter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"Peter,\" said little Benjamin, in a whisper, \"who has got your clothes?\"  Peter replied, \"The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,\" and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.\n\nLittle Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.\n\nPeter said he hoped that it would rain.\n\nAt this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: \"Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!\"  Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.\n\nThey went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.\n\nLittle Benjamin said: \"It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.\"  Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.\n\nIt had been sown with lettuces.\n\nThey left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.\n\nLittle Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.\n\nThey took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.\n\nBenjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.\n\nThen he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.\n\nPeter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.\n\nBenjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.\n\n(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)  The lettuces certainly were very fine.\n\nPeter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions.\n\nLittle Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.\n\nThe mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.\n\nPresently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.\n\nThey got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.\n\nThis is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket....\n\nThe cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.\n\nPerhaps she liked the smell of onions!  Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.\n\nShe sat there for five hours.\n\nI cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.\n\nThe sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.\n\nAt length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.\n\nThe cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.\n\nHe was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.\n\nHe was looking for his son.\n\nOld Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.\n\nHe took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.\n\nThe cat was too much surprised to scratch back.\n\nWhen old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.\n\nThen he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.\n\nThen he took out his nephew Peter.\n\nThen he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.\n\nWhen Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.\n\nIt looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door upon the outside.\n\nWhen Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco."

So he decided to go to a nearby forest to cut wood and bring it home to repair his handloom. The weaver, then took an axe and set out to the forest.\n\nWhile he was walking on the seashore looking for a good tree, he come across a Shinvashapa tree. He decided to cut it down to repair his loom.\n\nAs soon as, the weaver started cutting down the tree with his axe, he heard a voice saying, \"Stop! please don't cut this tree. It's my home.\"\n\n\"So What!\" the weaver said. \"I've to repair my loom, otherwise, how will I weave the cloth and sell it in the market to feed my wife and children. Please find some other tree to live in.\"\n\nAs soon as, the weaver raised his axe to strike again at the root of the tree, the voice requested yet again, \"Please spare this tree. I am very pleased with your answer. Ask for a boon and I'll grant it.\"\n\n\"That's fine, but let me consult my wife and friends and then I'll let you know about my wish.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the tree devta, \"do it and come back to me.\"\n\nThe weaver returned to his town. There he consulted his friend, a barber. After listening to the whole story the barber said, \"It would be wise of you to ask for a kingdom. Once the boon is granted you will become a king and there will be no scarcity of any kind in your life. And then I hope you will make me your prime minister.\"\n\n\"This is all right, but let me consult my wife also. She loves me verymuch.\"\n\n\"Don't do this. The shastras advise against consulting women, because of their lower level of intelligence.\"\n\nBut the weaver went to his wife. He narrated the whole story to her. \"Tell me,\" the weaver asked his wife, \"what boon should I ask for? My friend, the barber has advised me to ask for a kingdom.\"\n\n\"Your barber friend is a fool,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Kingdoms have always been a source of trouble. You'd have to fight battles to defend your kingdom. You'd have to look after the welfare of your people. Rama had to go into exile. Ravana was destroyed. It's for the sake of kingdom that brothers, sons and other close relatives plot to kill each other. So, its better that you ask for something, which'lI bring more benefits to us. You may ask for two more hands and one more head, so that you could weave more cloth and earn more money by selling more cloth in the market.\"\n\nThe weaver then approached the tree devta and told him about his wish. The devta fulfilled his wish. The weaver got two extra hands and one extra head.\n\nBut while the weaver was returning home full of joy, the town people saw him and got frightened. They thought him to be some kind of a monster. They began pelting stones at the weaver and killed him.\n\nWhen the barber came to know about the death of the weaver, he became very sad.\n\nMoral: An advice should never be followed blindly."

Paapbuddhi made a plan to earn wealth with the help of Dharambuddhi.\n\nOne day, he said to Dharambuddhi, \"Friend, why are you wasting your talent here? If you go to some other town, you may come across many opportunities to earn a lot of money and fame. If you like, I can also accompany you to the new town.\"\n\nDharambuddhi agreed to the proposal of Paapbuddhi. Both of them set out on a long journey to settle in a new town.\n\nThere, Dharambuddhi became very famous and rich in the new town.\n\nAfter Dharambuddhi and Paapbuddhi had earned a lot of money, decided to return to their home town.\n\nAs they arrived near their home town, Paapbuddhi said to Dharambuddhi, \"I suppose it will be better if we don't carry all our wealth with us. Our relatives may ask for their share. Let's take a nominal amount with us and bury the rest in a pit here. When the need arises, we may come here again and take out the money from the pit.\n\nSo, they dug up a pit and after burying their wealth in it, they went to their respective homes.\n\nBut, thereafter, in one dark night Paapbuddhi visited the pit all alone and along with his money he stole Dharambuddhi's money also.\n\nAfter a few days Paapbuddhi went to Dharambuddhi and said,”Friend I need some money. Let us go to the pit to take out some money.” Dharambhddhi agreed to it and Paapbuddhi and Dharambuddhi went to the spot where the wealth was buried.They dug up the pit, but there was no wealth, in the pit.\n\n\"I never did it,\" said Dharambuddhi in great anger. Both of them began to fight with each other and at last, the matter was taken to the court.\n\nPaapbuddhi narrated the whole story and said to the judge, \"My lord! Dharambuddhi denies that he dug up the wealth in my absence. So, in my opinion the court should hear the tree also who was the sole witness to all that happened to the wealth there.\"\n\nThe court agreed to this and fixed a date when the court will visit the tree to know the tree's version.\n\nIn the meantime, Paapbuddhi told his father, \"Father, you know, I've stolen the wealth of Dharambuddhi. I want you to help me, or else I'll be caught and punished by the court.\"\n\n\"What am I supposed to do?\" asked Paapbuddhi's father, \"I don't want to lose the wealth.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Paapbuddhi, \"there is a Shami tree in the jungle. We had buried the wealth near this tree. The tree is hollow from inside. You just hide in the hollow. When the judges ask you to name the thief you shout from inside the tree. 'It's Dharambuddhi.' His father agreed to do it.\n\nOn the appointed day, the judge accompanied by Paapbuddhi and Dharambuddhi and other people went to the tree. Paapbuddhi then went near the tree and asked in a loud voice, \"0, divine tree, tell us the name of the thief?\"\n\nImmediately, there came a voice from inside the tree,\"Dharambuddhi is the thief. He has stolen the wealth.\"\n\nThe judge was wonderstruck to hear the tree speak.\n\nBut, meanwhile, Dharambuddhi put a heap of dry leaves and grass around the tree and lighted it. Everyone failed to understand what Dharambuddhi was upto. Soon there was a big fire around the tree trunk. After sometime, Paapbuddhi's father jumped out of the hollow of the tree yelling for help. Half of his body was burnt and his eyes were popping out.\n\nNow everything was crystal clear. The judge understood the whole story. He held Paapbuddhi responsible for the theft. He ordered his men of the court to hang Paapbuddhi to death by the same Shami tree.\n\nThe people were happy that Dharambuddhi, after all, got justice. Paapbuddhi was rightly punished for his greed and dishonesty.\n\nMoral: Sometimes bad person also comes in need."

One day the old man lost patience and said: \"Listen, old crony, you live as if you were in clover, give me a couple of eggs so that I can at least have a taste of them.\"\n\n\"No indeed!\" replied the old woman, who was very avaricious. \"If you want eggs, beat your rooster that he may lay eggs for you, and then eat them; I flogged my hen, and just see how she lays now.\"\n\nThe old man, being stingy and greedy, listened to the old woman's talk, angrily seized his rooster, gave him a sound thrashing and said:\n\n\"There, now, lay some eggs for me or else go out of the house, I won't feed you for nothing any longer.\"\n\nAs soon as the rooster escaped from the old man's hands it ran off down the high-road. While thus pursuing its way, lo and behold! it found a little purse with two half-pennies. Taking it in its beak, the bird turned and went back toward the old man's house. On the road it met a carriage containing a gentleman and several ladies. The gentleman looked at the rooster, saw a purse in its bill, and said to the driver:\n\n\"Get down and see what this rooster has in its beak.\"\n\nThe driver hastily jumped from his box, took the little purse from the rooster's bill, and gave it to his master. The gentleman put it in his pocket and drove on. The rooster was very angry and ran after the carriage, repeating continually:\n\n\"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,  To me the little purse give back.\"\n\nThe enraged gentleman said to the coachman as they passed a well:\n\n\"Take that impudent rooster and throw it into the well.\"\n\nThe driver got down from his box again, seized the rooster, and flung it down the well. When the rooster saw that its life was in such great danger, what was it to do?\n\nIt began to swallow the water, and drank and drank till it had swallowed all the water in the well. Then it flew out and again ran after the carriage, calling:\n\n\"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,  To me the little purse give back.\"\n\nWhen the gentleman saw this, he was perfectly amazed and said:\n\n\"Hoho! This rooster is a perfect imp of Satan! Never mind! I'll wring your neck, you saucy cockerel!\" When he reached home he told the cook to take the rooster, throw it on the coals burning upon the hearth, and push a big stone in front of the opening in the chimney. The old woman did what her master bade her.\n\nWhen the rooster saw this new injustice, it began to spit out the water it had swallowed till it had poured all the water from the well upon the burning coals. This put out the fire, cooled the hearth, and made such a flood on the kitchen floor that the cook fainted away from pure rage. Then the rooster gave the stone a push, came out safe and sound, ran to the gentleman's window, and began to knock on the panes with its bill, screaming:\n\n\"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,  To me the little purse give back.\"\n\n\"Heaven knows that I've got a torment in this monster of a rooster,\" said the gentleman. \"Driver, rid me of it, toss it into the middle of the herds of cows and oxen; perhaps some bull will stick its horns through it and relieve us.\" The coachman seized the rooster and flung it among the herds. You ought to have seen the rooster's delight. It swallowed bulls, oxen, cows, and calves, till it had devoured the whole herd and its stomach had grown as big as a mountain. Then it went to the window again, spread out its wings before the sun so that it darkened the gentleman's room, and once more began:\n\n\"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,  To me the little purse give back.\"\n\nWhen the gentleman saw this he was ready to burst with rage and did not know what to do to get rid of the rooster. He stood thinking till at last an idea entered his head:\n\n\"I'll lock it up in the treasure-chamber. Perhaps if it tries to swallow the ducats one will stick in its throat, and I shall get rid of the bird.\" No sooner said than done. He grasped the rooster and flung it into the treasure-chamber. The rooster swallowed all the money and left the chests empty. Then it escaped from the room, went to the gentleman's window, and again began:\n\n\"Kikeriki, sir, Kikerikak,  To me the little purse give back.\"\n\nAs the gentleman saw that there was nothing else to be done he tossed the purse out. The rooster picked it up, went about its own business, and left the gentleman in peace. All the poultry ran after the rooster so that it really looked like a wedding; but the gentleman turned green with rage as he watched, and said sighing:\n\n\"Let them all run off to the last chick, I'm glad to be rid of the torment; there was witchcraft in that rooster!\"\n\nBut the puffed-up rooster stalked proudly along, followed by all the fowls, and went merrily on and on till he reached the old man's house and began to crow: \"Kikeriki!\"\n\nWhen the old man heard the rooster's voice he ran out joyfully to meet the bird, but looking through the door what did he see? His rooster had become a terrible object. An elephant beside it would have seemed like a flea; and following behind came countless flocks of birds, each one more beautiful and brilliant than the other. When the old man saw the rooster so huge and fat, he opened the gate for it. \"Master,\" said the bird, \"spread a sheet here in the middle of the yard.\"\n\nThe old man, as nimble as a top, laid down the sheet. The rooster took its stand upon it, spread its wings, and instantly the whole yard was filled with birds and herds of cattle, but it shook out on the sheet a pile of ducats that flashed in the sun till they dazzled the eyes. When the old man beheld this vast treasure he did not know what to do in his delight, and hugged and kissed the rooster.\n\nBut all at once the old woman appeared from somewhere, and when she saw this marvelous spectacle her eyes glittered in her head, and she was ready to burst with wrath.\n\n\"Dear old friend,\" she said, \"give me a few ducats.\"\n\n\"Pine away with longing for them, old woman; when I begged you for some eggs, you know what you answered. Now flog your hen, that it may bring you ducats. I beat my rooster, and you see what it has fetched me.\"\n\nThe old woman went to the hen-coop, shook the hen, took it by the tail, and gave it such a drubbing that it was enough to make one weep for pity. When the poor hen escaped from the old woman's hands it fled to the highway. While walking along it found a bead, swallowed it, hurried back home as fast as possible, and began to cackle at the gate. The old woman welcomed it joyfully. The hen ran quickly in at the gate, passed its mistress, and went to its nest--at the end of an hour it jumped off, cackling loudly. The old woman hastened to see what the hen had laid. But when she glanced into the nest what did she perceive? A little glass bead. The hen had laid a glass bead! When the old woman saw that the hen had fooled her, she began to beat it, and beat till she flogged it to death. So the stupid old soul remained as poor as a church-mouse. From that time she might live on roast nothing and golden wait a while, instead of eggs, for she had abused and killed the poor hen, though it was not at all to blame.\n\nBut the old man was very rich; he built great houses, laid out beautiful gardens, and lived luxuriously. He made the old woman his poultry-maid, the rooster he took about with him everywhere, dressed in a gold collar, yellow boots, and spurs on its heels, so that one might have thought it was one of the Three Kings from the Christmas play instead of a mere ordinary rooster."

      "body": "The Merchant And The Barber:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a merchant called by the name of Manibhadra, in a town known as Patliputra. He was of a charitable nature. But, somehow, due to misfortune, he lost all his wealth and became a pauper. His status in the society gradually came down. He became sad and dejected.\n\nOne night, as he lay in his bed, he started cursing his fate and thought of committing suicide by starving himself to death.\n\nWhile thinking thus, he fell asleep. A jain monk appeared in his dream and said to him, \"Don't worry! I'm wealth, gathered by your forefathers. You are their legitimate heir. It's your legal right to possess me. Tomorrow, I shall come to your house in the guise of a jain monk. Just hit me on my head with a stick and I'll turn into solid gold.\"\n\nThe next morning, when the merchant woke up he felt pain in his head. He didn't believe his dream. In the meantime, his wife had called in a barber to massage her feet. Soon after the arrival of the barber, a jain monk came to the merchant's house. The merchant welcomed the monk. He offered him seat and a glass of water. Then he hit the monk's head with a stick. The monk fell down and turned into gold from head to toe.\n\nThe merchant picked up the gold and hid it in a basement room.\n\nThe barber who was a witness to all this thought to himself: 'I'll also invite these magical monks to my home to dine with me. When they come, I'll hit them on their heads, to turn them in gold. Soon I'll be a wealthy man'.\n\nThen the barber went to the head monk and invited him and other monks to his house to dine with him. But the head monk refused the invitation. He said, \"We are no Brahmins, who're invited to the houses to eat. Everyday, we collect alms and accept food only from the first devotee of the day. We eat to live only and not live to eat.\"\n\nThe barber then waited outside the monastery. When the monks came out, he requested them to come to his house and conduct prayers. A few monks agreed to it and went to the barber's house.\n\nAs soon as the monks entered the house, the barber hit them on their heads with a heavy stick. A few monks died, whereas a few others were badly injured.\n\nThe news of the barber hitting the monks spread in the town like wild fire. The barber was arrested by the authorities and taken to the court of law.\n\nThe judges, in the court, asked the barber, \"Why did you do this?\" \n\nThe barber then narrated the whole story. He said, \"I did it because saw the merchant doing it.\"\n\nThen the merchant was ordered to appear before the court. The merchant narrated the whole story.\n\nThe judges then ordered, \"Let this wicked barber be hanged till death.\" The barber was then hanged to death.\n\nMoral: A blind imitation is always dangerous."

      "body": "The Yellow Dwarf:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a queen who had been the mother of a great many children, and of them all only one daughter was left. But then she was worth at least a thousand.\n\nHer mother, who, since the death of the King, her father, had nothing in the world she cared for so much as this little Princess, was so terribly afraid of losing her that she quite spoiled her, and never tried to correct any of her faults. The consequence was that this little person, who was as pretty as possible, and was one day to wear a crown, grew up so proud and so much in love with her own beauty that she despised everyone else in the world.\n\nThe Queen, her mother, by her caresses and flatteries, helped to make her believe that there was nothing too good for her. She was dressed almost always in the prettiest frocks, as a fairy, or as a queen going out to hunt, and the ladies of the Court followed her dressed as forest fairies.\n\nAnd to make her more vain than ever the Queen caused her portrait to be taken by the cleverest painters and sent it to several neighboring kings with whom she was very friendly.\n\nWhen they saw this portrait they fell in love with the Princess—every one of them, but upon each it had a different effect. One fell ill, one went quite crazy, and a few of the luckiest set off to see her as soon as possible, but these poor princes became her slaves the moment they set eyes on her.\n\nNever has there been a gayer Court. Twenty delightful kings did everything they could think of to make themselves agreeable, and after having spent ever so much money in giving a single entertainment thought themselves very lucky if the Princess said \"That's pretty.\"\n\nAll this admiration vastly pleased the Queen. Not a day passed but she received seven or eight thousand sonnets, and as many elegies, madrigals, and songs, which were sent her by all the poets in the world. All the prose and the poetry that was written just then was about Bellissima—for that was the Princess's name—and all the bonfires that they had were made of these verses, which crackled and sparkled better than any other sort of wood.\n\nBellissima was already fifteen years old, and every one of the Princes wished to marry her, but not one dared to say so. How could they when they knew that any of them might have cut off his head five or six times a day just to please her, and she would have thought it a mere trifle, so little did she care? You may imagine how hard-hearted her lovers thought her; and the Queen, who wished to see her married, did not know how to persuade her to think of it seriously.\n\n\"Bellissima,\" she said, \"I do wish you would not be so proud. What makes you despise all these nice kings? I wish you to marry one of them, and you do not try to please me.\"\n\n\"I am so happy,\" Bellissima answered: \"do leave me in peace, madam. I don't want to care for anyone.\"\n\n\"But you would be very happy with any of these Princes,\" said the Queen, \"and I shall be very angry if you fall in love with anyone who is not worthy of you.\"\n\nBut the Princess thought so much of herself that she did not consider any one of her lovers clever or handsome enough for her; and her mother, who was getting really angry at her determination not to be married, began to wish that she had not allowed her to have her own way so much.\n\nAt last, not knowing what else to do, she resolved to consult a certain witch who was called \"The Fairy of the Desert.\" Now this was very difficult to do, as she was guarded by some terrible lions; but happily the Queen had heard a long time before that whoever wanted to pass these lions safely must throw to them a cake made of millet flour, sugar-candy, and crocodile's eggs. This cake she prepared with her own hands, and putting it in a little basket, she set out to seek the Fairy. But as she was not used to walking far, she soon felt very tired and sat down at the foot of a tree to rest, and presently fell fast asleep. When she awoke she was dismayed to find her basket empty. The cake was all gone! and, to make matters worse, at that moment she heard the roaring of the great lions, who had found out that she was near and were coming to look for her.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she cried; \"I shall be eaten up,\" and being too frightened to run a single step, she began to cry, and leaned against the tree under which she had been asleep.\n\nJust then she heard someone say: \"H'm, h'm!\"\n\nShe looked all round her, and then up the tree, and there she saw a little tiny man, who was eating oranges.\n\n\"Oh! Queen,\" said he, \"I know you very well, and I know how much afraid you are of the lions; and you are quite right too, for they have eaten many other people: and what can you expect, as you have not any cake to give them?\"\n\n\"I must make up my mind to die,\" said the poor Queen. \"Alas! I should not care so much if only my dear daughter were married.\"\n\n\"Oh! you have a daughter,\" cried the Yellow Dwarf (who was so called because he was a dwarf and had such a yellow face, and lived in the orange tree). \"I'm really glad to hear that, for I've been looking for a wife all over the world. Now, if you will promise that she shall marry me, not one of the lions, tigers, or bears shall touch you.\"\n\nThe Queen looked at him and was almost as much afraid of his ugly little face as she had been of the lions before, so that she could not speak a word.\n\n\"What! you hesitate, madam,\" cried the Dwarf. \"You must be very fond of being eaten up alive.\"\n\nAnd, as he spoke, the Queen saw the lions, which were running down a hill toward them.\n\nEach one had two heads, eight feet, and four rows of teeth, and their skins were as hard as turtle shells, and were bright red.\n\nAt this dreadful sight, the poor Queen, who was trembling like a dove when it sees a hawk, cried out as loud as she could, \"Oh! dear Mr. Dwarf, Bellissima shall marry you.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said he disdainfully. \"Bellissima is pretty enough, but I don't particularly want to marry her—you can keep her.\"\n\n\"Oh! noble sir,\" said the Queen in great distress, ado not refuse her. She is the most charming Princess in the world.\"\n\n\"Oh! well,\" he replied, \"out of charity I will take her; but be sure and don't forget that she is mine.\"\n\nAs he spoke a little door opened in the trunk of the orange tree, in rushed the Queen, only just in time, and the door shut with a bang in the faces of the lions.\n\nThe Queen was so confused that at first she did not notice another little door in the orange tree, but presently it opened and she found herself in a field of thistles and nettles. It was encircled by a muddy ditch, and a little further on was a tiny thatched cottage, out of which came the Yellow Dwarf with a very jaunty air. He wore wooden shoes and a little yellow coat, and as he had no hair and very long ears he looked altogether a shocking little object.\n\n\"I am delighted,\" said he to the Queen, \"that, as you are to be my mother-in-law, you should see the little house in which your Bellissima will live with me. With these thistles and nettles she can feed a donkey which she can ride whenever she likes; under this humble roof no weather can hurt her; she will drink the water of this brook and eat frogs—which grow very fat about here; and then she will have me always with her, handsome, agreeable, and gay as you see me now. For if her shadow stays by her more closely than I do I shall be surprised.\"\n\nThe unhappy Queen. seeing all at once what a miserable life her daughter would have with this Dwarf could not bear the idea, and fell down insensible without saying a word.\n\nWhen she revived she found to her great surprise that she was lying in her own bed at home, and, what was more, that she had on the loveliest lace night cap that she had ever seen in her life. At first she thought that all her adventures, the terrible lions, and her promise to the Yellow Dwarf that he should marry Bellissima, must have been a dream, but there was the new cap with its beautiful ribbon and lace to remind her that it was all true, which made her so unhappy that she could neither eat, drink, nor sleep for thinking of it.\n\nThe Princess, who, in spite of her wilfulness, really loved her mother with all her heart, was much grieved when she saw her looking so sad, and often asked her what was the matter; but the Queen, who didn't want her to find out the truth, only said that she was ill, or that one of her neighbors was threatening to make war against her. Bellissima knew quite well that something was being hidden from her—and that neither of these was the real reason of the Queen's uneasiness. So she made up her mind that she would go and consult the Fairy of the Desert about it, especially as she had often heard how wise she was, and she thought that at the same time she might ask her advice as to whether it would be as well to be married, or not.\n\nSo, with great care, she made some of the proper cake to pacify the lions, and one night went up to her room very early, pretending that she was going to bed; but instead of that, she wrapped herself in a long white veil, and went down a secret staircase, and set off all by herself to find the Witch.\n\nBut when she got as far as the same fatal orange tree, and saw it covered with flowers and fruit, she stopped and began to gather some of the oranges—and then, putting down her basket, she sat down to eat them. But when it was time to go on again the basket had disappeared and, though she looked everywhere, not a trace of it could she find. The more she hunted for it, the more frightened she got, and at last she began to cry. Then all at once she saw before her the Yellow Dwarf.\n\n\"What's the matter with you, my pretty one?\" said he. \"What are you crying about?\"\n\n\"Alas!\" she answered; \"no wonder that I am crying, seeing that I have lost the basket of cake that was to help me to get safely to the cave of the Fairy of the Desert.\"\n\n\"And what do you want with her, pretty one?\" said the little monster, \"for I am a friend of hers, and, for the matter of that, I am quite as clever as she is.\"\n\n\"The Queen, my mother,\" replied the Princess, \"has lately fallen into such deep sadness that I fear that she will die; and I am afraid that perhaps I am the cause of it, for she very much wishes me to be married, and I must tell you truly that as yet I have not found anyone I consider worthy to be my husband. So for all these reasons I wished to talk to the Fairy.\"\n\n\"Do not give yourself any further trouble, Princess,\" answered the Dwarf. \"I can tell you all you want to know better than she could. The Queen, your mother, has promised you in marriage——\"\n\n\"Has promised me!\" interrupted the Princess. \"Oh! no. I'm sure she has not. She would have told me if she had. I am too much interested in the matter for her to promise anything without my consent—you must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"Beautiful Princess,\" cried the Dwarf suddenly, throwing himself on his knees before her, \"I flatter myself that you will not be displeased at her choice when I tell you that it is to me she has promised the happiness of marrying you.\"\n\n\"You!\" cried Bellissima, starting back. \"My mother wishes me to marry you! How can you be so silly as to think of such a thing?\"\n\n\"Oh! it isn't that I care much to have that honor,\" cried the Dwarf angrily; \"but here are the lions coming; they'll eat you up in three mouthfuls, and there will be an end of you and your pride.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, at that moment the poor Princess heard their dreadful howls coming nearer and nearer.\n\n\"What shall I do?\" she cried. \"Must all my happy days come to an end like this?\"\n\nThe malicious Dwarf looked at her and began to laugh spitefully. \"At least,\" said he, \"you have the satisfaction of dying unmarried. A lovely Princess like you must surely prefer to die rather than be the wife of a poor little dwarf like myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be angry with me,\" cried the Princess, clasping her hands. \"I'd rather marry all the dwarfs in the world than die in this horrible way.\"\n\n\"Look at me well, Princess, before you give me your word,\" said he. \"I don't want you to promise me in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried she, \"the lions are coming. I have looked at you enough. I am so frightened. Save me this minute, or I shall die of terror.\"\n\nIndeed, as she spoke she fell down insensible, and when she recovered she found herself in her own little bed at home; how she got there she could not tell, but she was dressed in the most beautiful lace and ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair, which fitted so tightly that, try as she might, she could not get it off.\n\nWhen the Princess saw all these things, and remembered what had happened, she, too, fell into the deepest sadness, which surprised and alarmed the whole Court, and the Queen more than anyone else. A hundred times she asked Bellissima if anything was the matter with her; but she always said that there was nothing.\n\nAt last the chief men of the kingdom, anxious to see their Princess married, sent to the Queen to beg her to choose a husband for her as soon as possible. She replied that nothing would please her better, but that her daughter seemed so unwilling to marry, and she recommended them to go and talk to the Princess about it themselves so this they at once did. Now Bellissima was much less proud since her adventure with the Yellow Dwarf, and she could not think of a better way of getting rid of the little monster than to marry some powerful king, therefore she replied to their request much more favorably than they had hoped, saying that, though she was very happy as she was, still, to please them, she would consent to marry the King of the Gold Mines.\n\n Now he was a very handsome and powerful Prince, who had been in love with the Princess for years, but had not thought that she would ever care about him at all. You can easily imagine how delighted he was when he heard the news, and how angry it made all the other kings to lose forever the hope of marrying the Princess; but, after all, Bellissima could not have married twenty kings—indeed, she had found it quite difficult enough to choose one, for her vanity made her believe that there was nobody in the world who was worthy of her.\n\nPreparations were begun at once for the grandest wedding that had ever been held at the palace. The King of the Gold Mines sent such immense sums of money that the whole sea was covered with the ships that brought it. Messengers were sent to all the gayest and most refined Courts, particularly to the Court of France, to seek out everything rare and precious to adorn the Princess, although her beauty was so perfect that nothing she wore could make her look prettier. At least that is what the King of the Gold Mines thought, and he was never happy unless he was with her.\n\nAs for the Princess, the more she saw of the King the more she liked him; he was so generous, so handsome and clever, that at last she was almost as much in love with him as he was with her. How happy they were as they wandered about in the beautiful gardens together, sometimes listening to sweet music! And the King used to write songs for Bellissima. This is one that she liked very much:\n\nIn the forest all is gay\n\nWhen my Princess walks that way.\n\nAll the blossoms then are found\n\nDownward fluttering to the ground,\n\nHoping she may tread on them.\n\nAnd bright flowers on slender stem\n\nGaze up at her as she passes\n\nBrushing lightly through the grasses.\n\nOh! my Princess, birds above\n\nEcho back our songs of love,\n\nAs through this enchanted land\n\nBlithe we wander, hand in hand.\n\nThey really were as happy as the day was long. All the King's unsuccessful rivals had gone home in despair. They said good-by to the Princess so sadly that she could not help being sorry for them.\n\n\"Ah! madam,\" the King of the Gold Mines said to her \"how is this? Why do you waste your pity on these princes, who love you so much that all their trouble would be well repaid by a single smile from you?\"\n\n\"I should be sorry,\" answered Bellissima, \"if you had not noticed how much I pitied these princes who were leaving me forever; but for you, sire, it is very different: you have every reason to be pleased with me, but they are going sorrowfully away, so you must not grudge them my compassion.\"\n\nThe King of the Gold Mines was quite overcome by the Princess's good-natured way of taking his interference, and, throwing himself at her feet, he kissed her hand a thousand times and begged her to forgive him.\n\nAt last the happy day came. Everything was ready for Bellissima's wedding. The trumpets sounded, all the streets of the town were hung with flags and strewn with flowers, and the people ran in crowds to the great square before the palace. The Queen was so overjoyed that she had hardly been able to sleep at all, and she got up before it was light to give the necessary orders and to choose the jewels that the Princess was to wear. \n\nThese were nothing less than diamonds, even to her shoes, which were covered with them, and her dress of silver brocade was embroidered with a dozen of the sun's rays. You may imagine how much these had cost; but then nothing could have been more brilliant, except the beauty of the Princess! Upon her head she wore a splendid crown, her lovely hair waved nearly to her feet, and her stately figure could easily be distinguished among all the ladies who attended her.\n\nThe King of the Gold Mines was not less noble and splendid; it was easy to see by his face how happy he was, and everyone who went near him returned loaded with presents, for all round the great banqueting hall had been arranged a thousand barrels full of gold, and numberless bags made of velvet embroidered with pearls and filled with money, each one containing at least a hundred thousand gold pieces, which were given away to everyone who liked to hold out his hand, which numbers of people hastened to do, you may be sure—indeed, some found this by far the most amusing part of the wedding festivities.\n\nThe Queen and the Princess were just ready to set out with the King when they saw, advancing toward them from the end of the long gallery, two great basilisks, dragging after them a very badly made box; behind them came a tall old woman, whose ugliness was even more surprising than her extreme old age. She wore a ruff of black taffeta, a red velvet hood, and a farthingale all in rags, and she leaned heavily upon a crutch. This strange old woman, without saying a single word, hobbled three times round the gallery, followed by the basilisks, then stopping in the middle, and brandishing her crutch threateningly, she cried:\n\n\"Ho, ho, Queen! Ho, ho, Princess! Do you think you are going to break with impunity the promise that you made to my friend the Yellow Dwarf? I am the Fairy of the Desert; without the Yellow Dwarf and his orange tree my great lions would soon have eaten you up, I can tell you, and in Fairyland we do not suffer ourselves to be insulted like this. Make up your minds at once what you will do, for I vow that you shall marry the Yellow Dwarf. If you don't, may I burn my crutch!\"\n\n\"Ah! Princess,\" said the Queen, weeping, \"what is this that I hear? What have you promised?\"\n\n\"Ah! my mother,\" replied Bellissima sadly, \"what did you promise, yourself?\"\n\nThe King of the Gold Mines, indignant at being kept from his happiness by this wicked old woman, went up to her, and threatening her with his sword, said:\n\n\"Get away out of my country at once, and forever, miserable creature, lest I take your life, and so rid myself of your malice.\"\n\nHe had hardly spoken these words when the lid of the box fell back on the floor with a terrible noise, and to their horror out sprang the Yellow Dwarf, mounted upon a great Spanish cat. \"Rash youth!\" he cried, rushing between the Fairy of the Desert and the King. \"Dare to lay a finger upon this illustrious Fairy! Your quarrel is with me only. I am your enemy and your rival. That faithless Princess who would have married you is promised to me. See if she has not upon her finger a ring made of one of my hairs. Just try to take it off, and you will soon find out that I am more powerful than you are!\"\n\n\"Wretched little monster!\" said the King; \"do you dare to call yourself the Princess's lover, and to lay claim to such a treasure? Do you know that you are a dwarf—that you are so ugly that one cannot bear to look at you—and that I should have killed you myself long before this if you had been worthy of such a glorious death?\"\n\nThe Yellow Dwarf, deeply enraged at these words, set spurs to his cat, which yelled horribly, and leaped hither and thither—terrifying everybody except the brave King, who pursued the Dwarf closely, till he, drawing a great knife with which he was armed, challenged the King to meet him in single combat, and rushed down into the courtyard of the palace with a terrible clatter. \n\nThe King, quite provoked, followed him hastily, but they had hardly taken their places facing one another, and the whole Court had only just had time to rush out upon the balconies to watch what was going on, when suddenly the sun became as red as blood, and it was so dark that they could scarcely see at all. The thunder crashed, and the lightning seemed as if it must burn up everything; the two basilisks appeared, one on each side of the bad Dwarf, like giants, mountains high, and fire flew from their mouths and ears, until they looked like flaming furnaces. None of these things could terrify the noble young King, and the boldness of his looks and actions reassured those who were looking on, and perhaps even embarrassed the Yellow Dwarf himself; but even his courage gave way when he saw what was happening to his beloved Princess. \n\nFor the Fairy of the Desert, looking more terrible than before, mounted upon a winged griffin, and with long snakes coiled round her neck, had given her such a blow with the lance she carried that Bellissima fell into the Queen's arms bleeding and senseless. Her fond mother, feeling as much hurt by the blow as the Princess herself, uttered such piercing cries and lamentations that the King, hearing them, entirely lost his courage and presence of mind. Giving up the combat, he flew toward the Princess, to rescue or to die with her; but the Yellow Dwarf was too quick for him. Leaping with his Spanish cat upon the balcony, he snatched Bellissima from the Queen's arms, and before any of the ladies of the Court could stop him he had sprung upon the roof of the palace and disappeared with his prize.\n\nThe King, motionless with horror, looked on despairingly at this dreadful occurrence, which he was quite powerless to prevent, and to make matters worse his sight failed him, everything became dark, and he felt himself carried along through the air by a strong hand.\n\nThis new misfortune was the work of the wicked Fairy of the Desert, who had come with the Yellow Dwarf to help him carry off the Princess, and had fallen in love with the handsome young King of the Gold Mines directly she saw him. She thought that if she carried him off to some frightful cavern and chained him to a rock, then the fear of death would make him forget Bellissima and become her slave. So, as soon as they reached the place, she gave him back his sight, but without releasing him from his chains, and by her magic power she appeared before him as a young and beautiful fairy, and pretended to have come there quite by chance.\n\n\"What do I see?\" she cried. \"Is it you, dear Prince? What misfortune has brought you to this dismal place?\"\n\nThe King, who was quite deceived by her altered appearance, replied:\n\n\"Alas! beautiful Fairy, the fairy who brought me here first took away my sight, but by her voice I recognized her as the Fairy of the Desert, though what she should have carried me off for I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the pretended Fairy, \"if you have fallen into her hands, you won't get away until you have married her. She has carried off more than one Prince like this, and she will certainly have anything she takes a fancy to.\" While she was thus pretending to be sorry for the King, he suddenly noticed her feet, which were like those of a griffin, and knew in a moment that this must be the Fairy of the Desert, for her feet were the one thing she could not change, however pretty she might make her face.\n\nWithout seeming to have noticed anything, he said, in a confidential way:\n\n\"Not that I have any dislike to the Fairy of the Desert, but I really cannot endure the way in which she protects the Yellow Dwarf and keeps me chained here like a criminal. It is true that I love a charming princess, but if the Fairy should set me free my gratitude would oblige me to love her only.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean what you say, Prince?\" said the Fairy, quite deceived.\n\n\"Surely,\" replied the Prince; \"how could I deceive you? You see it is so much more flattering to my vanity to be loved by a fairy than by a simple princess. But, even if I am dying of love for her, I shall pretend to hate her until I am set free.\"\n\nThe Fairy of the Desert, quite taken in by these words, resolved at once to transport the Prince to a pleasanter place. So, making him mount her chariot, to which she had harnessed swans instead of the bats which generally drew it, away she flew with him. But imagine the distress of the Prince when, from the giddy height at which they were rushing through the air, he saw his beloved Princess in a castle built of polished steel, the walls of which reflected the sun's rays so hotly that no one could approach it without being burnt to a cinder! Bellissima was sitting in a little thicket by a brook, leaning her head upon her hand and weeping bitterly, but just as they passed she looked up and saw the King and the Fairy of the Desert. Now, the Fairy was so clever that she could not only seem beautiful to the King, but even the poor Princess thought her the most lovely being she had ever seen.\n\n\"What!\" she cried; \"was I not unhappy enough in this lonely castle to which that frightful Yellow Dwarf brought me? Must I also be made to know that the King of the Gold Mines ceased to love me as soon as he lost sight of me? But who can my rival be, whose fatal beauty is greater than mine?\"\n\nWhile she was saying this, the King, who really loved her as much as ever, was feeling terribly sad at being so rapidly torn away from his beloved Princess, but he knew too well how powerful the Fairy was to have any hope of escaping from her except by great patience and cunning.\n\nThe Fairy of the Desert had also seen Bellissima, and she tried to read in the King's eyes the effect that this unexpected sight had had upon him.\n\n\"No one can tell you what you wish to know better than I can,\" said he. \"This chance meeting with an unhappy princess for whom I once had a passing fancy, before I was lucky enough to meet you, has affected me a little, I admit, but you are so much more to me than she is that I would rather die than leave you.\"\n\n\"Ah, Prince,\" she said, \"can I believe that you really love me so much?\"\n\n\"Time will show, madam,\" replied the King; \"but if you wish to convince me that you have some regard for me, do not, I beg of you, refuse to aid Bellissima.\"\n\n\"Do you know what you are asking?\" said the Fairy of the Desert, frowning, and looking at him suspiciously. \"Do you want me to employ my art against the Yellow Dwarf, who is my best friend, and take away from him a proud princess whom I can but look upon as my rival?\"\n\nThe King sighed, but made no answer—indeed, what was there to be said to such a clear-sighted person? At last they reached a vast meadow, gay with all sorts of flowers; a deep river surrounded it, and many little brooks murmured softly under the shady trees, where it was always cool and fresh. A little way off stood a splendid palace, the walls of which were of transparent emeralds. As soon as the swans which drew the Fairy's chariot had alighted under a porch, which was paved with diamonds and had arches of rubies, they were greeted on all sides by thousands of beautiful beings, who came to meet them joyfully, singing these words:\n\n\"When Love within a heart would reign,\n\nUseless to strive against him ’tis.\n\nThe proud but feel a sharper pain,\n\nAnd make a greater triumph his.\"\n\nThe Fairy of the Desert was delighted to hear them sing of her triumphs; she led the King into the most splendid room that can be imagined, and left him alone for a little while, just that he might not feel that he was a prisoner; but he felt sure that she had not really gone quite away, but was watching him from some hiding-place. So walking up to a great mirror, he said to it, \"Trusty counselor, let me see what I can do to make myself agreeable to the charming Fairy of the Desert; for I can think of nothing but how to please her.\"\n\nAnd he at once set to work to curl his hair, and, seeing upon a table a grander coat than his own, he put it on carefully. The Fairy came back so delighted that she could not conceal her joy.\n\n\"I am quite aware of the trouble you have taken to please me,\" said she, \"and I must tell you that you have succeeded perfectly already. You see it is not difficult to do if you really care for me.\"\n\nThe King, who had his own reasons for wishing to keep the old Fairy in a good humor, did not spare pretty speeches, and after a time he was allowed to walk by himself upon the sea-shore. The Fairy of the Desert had by her enchantments raised such a terrible storm that the boldest pilot would not venture out in it, so she was not afraid of her prisoner's being able to escape; and he found it some relief to think sadly over his terrible situation without being interrupted by his cruel captor.\n\nPresently, after walking wildly up and down, he wrote these verses upon the sand with his stick:\n\n\"At last may I upon this shore\n\nLighten my sorrow with soft tears.\n\nAlas! alas! I see no more\n\nMy Love, who yet my sadness cheers.\n\n\"And thou, O raging, stormy Sea,\n\nStirred by wild winds, from depth to height,\n\nThou hold'st my loved one far from me,\n\nAnd I am captive to thy might.\n\n\"My heart is still more wild than thine,\n\nFor Fate is cruel unto me. Why must I thus in exile pine?\n\nWhy is my Princess snatched from me?\n\n\"O! lovely Nymphs, from ocean caves,\n\nWho know how sweet true love may be,\n\nCome up and calm the furious waves\n\nAnd set a desperate lover free!\"\n\nWhile he was still writing he heard a voice which attracted his attention in spite of himself. Seeing that the waves were rolling in higher than ever, he looked all round, and presently saw a lovely lady floating gently toward him upon the crest of a huge billow, her long hair spread all about her; in one hand she held a mirror, and in the other a comb, and instead of feet she had a beautiful tail like a fish, with which she swam.\n\nThe King was struck dumb with astonishment at this unexpected sight; but as soon as she came within speaking distance, she said to him, \"I know how sad you are at losing your Princess and being kept a prisoner by the Fairy of the Desert; if you like I will help you to escape from this fatal place, where you may otherwise have to drag on a weary existence for thirty years or more.\"\n\nThe King of the Gold Mines hardly knew what answer to make to this proposal. Not because he did not wish very much to escape, but he was afraid that this might be only another device by which the Fairy of the Desert was trying to deceive him. As he hesitated the Mermaid, who guessed his thoughts, said to him:\n\n\"You may trust me: I am not trying to entrap you. I am so angry with the Yellow Dwarf and the Fairy of the Desert that I am not likely to wish to help them, especially since I constantly see your poor Princess, whose beauty and goodness make me pity her so much; and I tell you that if you will have confidence in me I will help you to escape.\"\n\n\"I trust you absolutely,\" cried the King, \"and I will do whatever you tell me; but if you have seen my Princess I beg of you to tell me how she is and what is happening to her.\n\n\"We must not waste time in talking,\" said she. \"Come with me and I will carry you to the Castle of Steel, and we will leave upon this shore a figure so like you that even the Fairy herself will be deceived by it.\"\n\nSo saying, she quickly collected a bundle of sea-weed, and, blowing it three times, she said:\n\n\"My friendly sea-weeds, I order you to stay here stretched upon the sand until the Fairy of the Desert comes to take you away.\" And at once the sea-weeds became like the King, who stood looking at them in great astonishment, for they were even dressed in a coat like his, but they lay there pale and still as the King himself might have lain if one of the great waves had overtaken him and thrown him senseless upon the shore. And then the Mermaid caught up the King, and away they swam joyfully together.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, \"I have time to tell you about the Princess. In spite of the blow which the Fairy of the Desert gave her, the Yellow Dwarf compelled her to mount behind him upon his terrible Spanish cat; but she soon fainted away with pain and terror, and did not recover till they were within the walls of his frightful Castle of Steel. Here she was received by the prettiest girls it was possible to find, who had been carried there by the Yellow Dwarf, who hastened to wait upon her and showed her every possible attention. She was laid upon a couch covered with cloth of gold, embroidered with pearls as big as nuts.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" interrupted the King of the Gold Mines, \"if Bellissima forgets me, and consents to marry him, I shall break my heart.\"\n\n\"You need not be afraid of that,\" answered the Mermaid, \"the Princess thinks of no one but you, and the frightful Dwarf cannot persuade her to look at him.\"\n\n\"Pray go on with your story,\" said the King.\n\n\"What more is there to tell you?\" replied the Mermaid. \"Bellissima was sitting in the wood when you passed, and saw you with the Fairy of the Desert, who was so cleverly disguised that the Princess took her to be prettier than herself; you may imagine her despair, for she thought that you had fallen in love with her.\"\n\n\"She believes that I love her!\" cried the King. \"What a fatal mistake! What is to be done to undeceive her?\"\n\n\"You know best,\" answered the Mermaid, smiling kindly at him. \"When people are as much in love with one another as you two are, they don't need advice from anyone else.\"\n\nAs she spoke they reached the Castle of Steel, the side next the sea being the only one which the Yellow Dwarf had left unprotected by the dreadful burning walls.\n\n\"I know quite well,\" said the Mermaid, \"that the Princess is sitting by the brook-side, just where you saw her as you passed, but as you will have many enemies to fight with before you can reach her, take this sword; armed with it you may dare any danger, and overcome the greatest difficulties, only beware of one thing—that is, never to let it fall from your hand. Farewell; now I will wait by that rock, and if you need my help in carrying off your beloved Princess I will not fail you, for the Queen, her mother, is my best friend, and it was for her sake that I went to rescue you.\"\n\nSo saying, she gave to the King a sword made from a single diamond, which was more brilliant than the sun. He could not find words to express his gratitude, but he begged her to believe that he fully appreciated the importance of her gift, and would never forget her help and kindness.\n\nWe must now go back to the Fairy of the Desert. When she found that the King did not return, she hastened out to look for him, and reached the shore, with a hundred of the ladies of her train, loaded with splendid presents for him. Some carried baskets full of diamonds, others golden cups of wonderful workmanship, and amber, coral, and pearls, others, again, balanced upon their heads bales of the richest and most beautiful stuffs, while the rest brought fruit and flowers, and even birds.\n\n But what was the horror of the Fairy, who followed this gay troop, when she saw, stretched upon the sands, the image of the King which the Mermaid had made with the sea-weeds. Struck with astonishment and sorrow, she uttered a terrible cry, and threw herself down beside the pretended King, weeping, and howling, and calling upon her eleven sisters, who were also fairies, and who came to her assistance. But they were all taken in by the image of the King, for, clever as they were, the Mermaid was still cleverer, and all they could do was to help the Fairy of the Desert to make a wonderful monument over what they thought was the grave of the King of the Gold Mines.\n\n But while they were collecting jasper and porphyry, agate and marble, gold and bronze, statues and devices, to immortalize the King's memory, he was thanking the good Mermaid and begging her still to help him, which she graciously promised to do as she disappeared; and then he set out for the Castle of Steel. He walked fast, looking anxiously round him, and longing once more to see his darling Bellissima, but he had not gone far before he was surrounded by four terrible sphinxes who would very soon have torn him to pieces with their sharp talons if it had not been for the Mermaid's diamond sword.\n\n For, no sooner had he flashed it before their eyes than down they fell at his feet quite helpless, and he killed them with one blow. But he had hardly turned to continue his search when he met six dragons covered with scales that were harder than iron. Frightful as this encounter was the King's courage was unshaken, and by the aid of his wonderful sword he cut them in pieces one after the other. Now he hoped his difficulties were over, but at the next turning he was met by one which he did not know how to overcome. Four-and-twenty pretty and graceful nymphs advanced toward him, holding garlands of flowers, with which they barred the way.\n\n\"Where are you going, Prince?\" they said; \"it is our duty to guard this place, and if we let you pass great misfortunes will happen to you and to us. We beg you not to insist upon going on. Do you want to kill four-and-twenty girls who have never displeased you in any way?\"\n\nThe King did not know what to do or to say. It went against all his ideas as a knight to do anything a lady begged him not to do; but, as he hesitated, a voice in his ear said:\n\n\"Strike! strike! and do not spare, or your Princess is lost forever!\"\n\nSo, without reply to the nymphs, he rushed forward instantly, breaking their garlands, and scattering them in all directions; and then went on without further hindrance to the little wood where he had seen Bellissima. She was seated by the brook looking pale and weary when he reached her, and he would have thrown himself down at her feet, but she drew herself away from him with as much indignation as if he had been the Yellow Dwarf.\n\n\"Ah! Princess,\" he cried, \"do not be angry with me. Let me explain everything. I am not faithless or to blame for what has happened. I am a miserable wretch who has displeased you without being able to help himself.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Bellissima, \"did I not see you flying through the air with the loveliest being imaginable? Was that against your will?\"\n\n\"Indeed it was, Princess,\" he answered; \"the wicked Fairy of the Desert, not content with chaining me to a rock, carried me off in her chariot to the other end of the earth, where I should even now be a captive but for the unexpected help of a friendly mermaid, who brought me here to rescue you, my Princess, from the unworthy hands that hold you. Do not refuse the aid of your most faithful lover.\" So saying, he threw himself at her feet and held her by her robe. But, alas! in so doing he let fall the magic sword, and the Yellow Dwarf, who was crouching behind a lettuce, no sooner saw it than he sprang out and seized it, well knowing its wonderful power.\n\nThe Princess gave a cry of terror on seeing the Dwarf, but this only irritated the little monster; muttering a few magical words he summoned two giants, who bound the King with great chains of iron.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Dwarf, \"I am master of my rival's fate, but I will give him his life and permission to depart unharmed if you, Princess, will consent to marry me.\"\n\n\"Let me die a thousand times rather,\" cried the unhappy King.\n\n\"Alas!\" cried the Princess, \"must you die? Could anything be more terrible?\"\n\n\"That you should marry that little wretch would be far more terrible,\" answered the King.\n\n\"At least,\" continued she, \"let us die together.\"\n\n\"Let me have the satisfaction of dying for you, my Princess,\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" she cried, turning to the Dwarf; \"rather than that I will do as you wish.\"\n\n\"Cruel Princess!\" said the King, \"would you make my life horrible to me by marrying another before my eyes?\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied the Yellow Dwarf; \"you are a rival of whom I am too much afraid; you shall not see our marriage.\" So saying, in spite of Bellissima's tears and cries, he stabbed the King to the heart with the diamond sword.\n\nThe poor Princess, seeing her lover lying dead at her feet, could no longer live without him; she sank down by him and died of a broken heart.\n\nSo ended these unfortunate lovers, whom not even the Mermaid could help, because all the magic power had been lost with the diamond sword.\n\nAs to the wicked Dwarf, he preferred to see the Princess dead rather than married to the King of the Gold Mines; and the Fairy of the Desert, when she heard of the King's adventures, pulled down the grand monument which she had built, and was so angry at the trick that had been played her that she hated him as much as she had loved him before.\n\nThe kind Mermaid, grieved at the sad fate of the lovers, caused them to be changed into two tall palm trees, which stand always side by side, whispering together of their faithful love and caressing one another with their interlacing branches."

      "body": "The Mongoose And The Baby In The Cradle:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a poor Brahmin named Dev Sharma with his wife in a small village. The Brahmin used to perform puja in religious functions taking place in nearby villages. They had no children. They offered prayers to god for a child. At last, a son was born to them.\n\nThe Brahmin's wife had a mongoose as her pet. The mongoose was very playful. He used to guard the Brahmin's house and also looked after the baby, while it slept in the cradle.\n\nOnce, some people came to invite the Brahmin for performing puja in their house. The Brahmin was in a quandary. Should he go to perform puja or stay home to look after his baby? His wife had also gone to fetch water from the well situated on the outskirts of the village.\n\nThe Brahmin didn't want to leave the baby all alone in the house, even though the mongoose was sitting there beside the cradle like a baby sitter. He was in a state of perplexity. But at last he buckled under the pressure and went to the nearby village to conduct the religious ceremony, leaving the baby all alone in the house.\n\nThe mongoose still sat beside the cradle guarding the baby. Suddenly, he saw a big black snake crawling towards the cradle. Being a natural enemy of snakes and also having the responsibility of guarding the baby, he pounced upon the snake. After a fierce fighting with the snake the mongoose killed it.\n\nBut the mouth and paws of the mongoose were smeared with the snake's blood. The mongoose was happy that he had done his duty faithfully and had saved the baby from the snake. He ran to the main entrance of the house and sat there waiting for his master's wife to come back. He thought that she would be highly impressed with his performance and shall reward him suitably.\n\nAfter sometime, the Brahmin's wife came along with the water pitcher on her head. She saw the paws and mouth of the mongoose smeared in blood.\n\nShe thought that the mongoose had killed her baby. In a fit of rage, she threw the heavy water pitcher on the head of the mongoose. The mongoose died on the spot.\n\nThe Brahmin'os wife now went running inside the house. There she saw a big black snake lying dead. The baby was sleeping safe in the cradle. Now she realised that she was greatly mistaken, and the mongoose had, in fact, saved her child. She began repenting and weeping. She had killed her faithful pet without knowing what had really happened.\n\nMoral: One should avoid taking hasty decisions in sensitive matters."

      "body": "The Devoted Friend:\n\nOne morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber. The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.\n\n\"You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,\" she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done. But the little ducks paid no attention to her. They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.\n\n\"What disobedient children!\" cried the old Water-rat; \"they really deserve to be drowned.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind,\" answered the Duck, \"every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.\"\n\n\"Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,\" said the Water- rat; \"I am not a family man. In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be. Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher. Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.\"\n\n\"And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?\" asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.\n\n\"Yes, that is just what I want to know,\" said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.\n\n\"What a silly question!\" cried the Water-rat. \"I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.\"\n\n\"And what would you do in return?\" said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" answered the Water-rat.\n\n\"Let me tell you a story on the subject,\" said the Linnet.\n\n\"Is the story about me?\" asked the Water-rat. \"If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.\"\n\n\"It is applicable to you,\" answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" said the Linnet, \"there was an honest little fellow named Hans.\"\n\n\"Was he very distinguished?\" asked the Water-rat.\n\n\"No,\" answered the Linnet, \"I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face. He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden. In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his. Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France. There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.\n\n\"Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller. Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.\n\n\"Real friends should have everything in common,\" the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.\n\n\"Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship.\n\n\"So little Hans worked away in his garden. During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts. In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.\n\n\"There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,\" the Miller used to say to his wife, \"for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors. That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right. So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.\"\n\n\"You are certainly very thoughtful about others,\" answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; 'very thoughtful indeed. It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship. I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.\"\n\n\"But could we not ask little Hans up here?\" said the Miller's youngest son. 'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.\"\n\n\"What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller; 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school. You seem not to learn anything. Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled. I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused. Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that.\"\n\n\"How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; 'really I feel quite drowsy. It is just like being in church.\"\n\n\"Lots of people act well,\" answered the Miller; 'but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also'; and he looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea. However, he was so young that you must excuse him.\"\n\n\"Is that the end of the story?\" asked the Water-rat.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" answered the Linnet, \"that is the beginning.\"\n\n\"Then you are quite behind the age,\" said the Water-rat. \"Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle. That is the new method. I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man. He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!\"  But pray go on with your story. I like the Miller immensely. I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, \"as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans.\n\n\"Why, what a good heart you have\"! cried his Wife; \"you are always thinking of others. And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.\"\n\n\"So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.\n\n\"Good morning, little Hans,\" said the Miller.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear.\n\n\"And how have you been all the winter?\" said the Miller.\n\n\"Well, really,\" cried Hans, \"it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed. I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.\"\n\n\"We often talked of you during the winter, Hans\" said the Miller, \"and wondered how you were getting on.\"\n\n\"That was kind of you,\" said Hans; \"I was half afraid you had forgotten me.\"\n\n\"Hans, I am surprised at you,\" said the Miller; 'friendship never forgets. That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye\"!\n\n\"They are certainly very lovely,\" said Hans, \"and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many. I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.\"\n\n\"Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don't mean to say you have sold it?  What a very stupid thing to do'!\n\n\"Well, the fact is,\" said Hans, \"that I was obliged to. You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with. So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow. But I am going to buy them all back again now.\"\n\n\"Hans,\" said the Miller, \"I will give you my wheelbarrow. It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you. I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world. I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself. Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.\"\n\n\"Well, really, that is generous of you,\" said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure. 'I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.\"\n\n\"A plank of wood'! said the Miller; 'why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn. There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don't stop it up. How lucky you mentioned it!  It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another. I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank. Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that. Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.\n\n\"It is not a very big plank,\" said the Miller, looking at it, \"and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return. Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.\"\n\n\"Quite full?\" said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.\n\n\"Well, really,\" answered the Miller, \"as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.\"\n\n\"My dear friend, my best friend,\" cried little Hans, \"you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden. I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day'; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.\n\n\"Good-bye, little Hans,\" said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.\n\n\"The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road. So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.\n\n\"There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.\n\n\"Dear little Hans,\" said the Miller, \"would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry,\" said Hans, \"but I am really very busy to-day. I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Miller, \"I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't say that,\" cried little Hans, \"I wouldn't be unfriendly for the whole world'; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders.\n\n\"It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest. However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market. After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.\n\n\"It has certainly been a hard day,\" said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, \"but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.\"\n\n\"Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said the Miller, \"you are very lazy. Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish. You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you. Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend. But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain. Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, \"but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing. Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?\"\n\n\"Well, I am glad of that,\" said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, \"for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.\"\n\n\"Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.\n\n\"Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?\" he inquired in a shy and timid voice.\n\n\"Well, really,\" answered the Miller, \"I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.\"\n\n\"Oh! on no account,\" cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.\n\n\"He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on.\n\n\"Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?\" cried the Miller in a cheery voice.\n\n\"It is quite mended,\" answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.\n\n\"Ah'! said the Miller, \"there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.\"\n\n\"It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,\" answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, \"a very great privilege. But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.\"\n\n\"Oh! they will come to you,\" said the Miller, \"but you must take more pains. At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.\"\n\n\"Do you really think I shall?\" asked little Hans.\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" answered the Miller, \"but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain. It took him the whole day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.\n\n\"What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,\" he said, and he went to work at once.\n\n\"But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill. Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend. 'Besides,\" he used to say, \"he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.\"\n\n\"So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.\n\n\"Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door. It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm. But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.\n\n\"It is some poor traveller,\" said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.\n\n\"There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.\n\n\"Dear little Hans,\" cried the Miller, \"I am in great trouble. My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me. You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" cried little Hans, \"I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once. But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry,\" answered the Miller, \"but it is my new lantern, and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind, I will do without it,\" cried little Hans, and he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off.\n\n\"What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand. However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor's house, and knocked at the door.\n\n\"Who is there?\" cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window.\n\n\"Little Hans, Doctor.\"\n\n\"What do you want, little Hans?\"\n\n\"The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.\n\n\"But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse. At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned. His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.\n\n\"Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.\n\n\"As I was his best friend,\" said the Miller, \"it is only fair that I should have the best place'; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,\" said the Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.\n\n\"A great loss to me at any rate,\" answered the Miller; 'why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don't know what to do with it. It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it. I will certainly take care not to give away anything again. One always suffers for being generous.\"\"\n\n\"Well?\" said the Water-rat, after a long pause.\n\n\"Well, that is the end,\" said the Linnet.\n\n\"But what became of the Miller?\" asked the Water-rat.\n\n\"Oh!  I really don't know,\" replied the Linnet; \"and I am sure that I don't care.\"\n\n\"It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,\" said the Water-rat.\n\n\"I am afraid you don't quite see the moral of the story,\" remarked the Linnet.\n\n\"The what?\" screamed the Water-rat.\n\n\"The moral.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the Linnet.\n\n\"Well, really,\" said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, \"I think you should have told me that before you began. If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said 'Pooh,\" like the critic. However, I can say it now\"; so he shouted out \"Pooh\" at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.\n\n\"And how do you like the Water-rat?\" asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards. \"He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.\"\n\n\"I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,\" answered the Linnet. \"The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,\" said the Duck.\n\nAnd I quite agree with her."

      "body": "The Twelve Huntsmen:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a prince who had a fiancée whom he loved very much. Once when he was sitting beside her very happily, news came that his father was deathly ill, and wanted to see him before he died.\n\nThen he said to his beloved, \"I must now go and leave you. I give you a ring to remember me by. As soon as I am king, I will return and take you home with me.\"\n\nThen he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was mortally ill and near death.\n\nThe king said to him, \"My dearest son, I wanted to see you one more time before my end. Promise me to marry the woman of my choice,\" and he named a certain princess who was to become his wife.\n\nThe son was so grieved that without thinking he said, \"Yes, dear father, your will shall be done.\"\n\nThen the king closed his eyes and died.\n\nAfter the son had been proclaimed king, and the period of mourning had passed, he had to keep the promise that he had given his father. He proposed marriage to the princess, and she was promised to him.\n\nHis first fiancée heard about this, and was so saddened by his faithlessness that she nearly died.\n\nThen her father said to her, \"Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have whatever you want.\"\n\nShe thought for a moment and then said, \"Dear father, I want eleven girls exactly like myself in appearance, figure, and size.\"\n\nThe father said, \"If it is possible, your wish shall be fulfilled,\" and he had his entire kingdom searched until eleven girls were found who were exactly like his daughter in appearance, figure, and size.\n\nWhen they came to the princess, she had twelve huntsmen's outfits made, each one like the others. The eleven girls put on the huntsmen's outfits, and she herself put on the twelfth outfit.\n\nAfter this she took leave of her father, and rode away with them. They rode to the court of her former fiancé, whom she loved so dearly. There she asked if he needed any huntsmen, and if he would take all of them into his service. The king looked at her without recognizing her. Because they were such good-looking fellows, he said, yes, that he would willingly take them, and then they were the king's twelve huntsmen.\n\nNow the king had a lion that was a miraculous animal, for he knew all hidden and secret things. It happened that one evening the lion said to the king, \"You think that you have twelve huntsmen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king, \"they are twelve huntsmen.\"\n\nThe lion continued, \"You are mistaken. They are twelve girls.\"\n\nThe king said, \"That is absolutely not true. How can you prove that to me?\"\n\n\"Oh, just have some peas scattered in your antechamber,\" answered the lion, \"and then you shall soon see. Men have a firm step, and when they walk over the peas, none of them will be moved. On the other hand, girls trip and skip and shuffle their feet, rolling the peas about.\"\n\nThe king liked this advise and had peas scattered on the floor.\n\nNow one of the king's servants liked the huntsmen, and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test, he went to them and told them everything, saying, \"The lion wants to make the king believe that you are girls.\"\n\nThe princess thanked him, then said to her girls, \"Be strong, and step firmly on the peas.\"\n\nThe next morning the king had the twelve huntsmen called before him. When they came into the antechamber where the peas were lying, they stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not one of the peas rolled or moved.\n\nAfter they had gone, the king said to the lion, \"You lied to me. They walk just like men.\"\n\nThe lion said, \"They knew that were going to be put to a test, and acted like they were strong. Just have twelve spinning wheels brought into the antechamber. They will go up to them and admire them. No man would do that.\"\n\nThe king liked this advice, and he had the spinning wheels set up in the antechamber.\n\nBut the servant who was honest with the huntsmen went to them and told them about the proposal.\n\nSo when they were alone, the princess said to her eleven girls, \"Be strong and do not look around at the spinning wheels.\"\n\nThe next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they walked through the antechamber without looking at the spinning wheels at all.\n\nThen the king again said to the lion, \"You lied to me. They are men, for they did not look at the spinning wheels.\"\n\nThe lion answered, \"They knew that they were going to be put to a test, and acted like they were strong.\"\n\nThe king, however, refused to believe the lion anymore.\n\nThe twelve huntsmen always accompanied the king hunting, and the longer he knew them, the better he liked them. Now it happened that once when they were out hunting, news came that the king's bride was approaching. When the true bride heard this, it hurt her so much that it almost broke her heart, and she fainted and fell to the ground.\n\nThinking that something had happened to his dear huntsman, the king ran up to him in order to help him. Pulling the huntsman's glove off, he saw the ring that he had given to his first fiancée, and when he looked into her face, he recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said, \"You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can change that.\"\n\nHe sent a messenger to the other bride, and asked her to return to her own kingdom, for, as he informed her, he already had a wife, and someone who had found an old key did not need a new one.\n\nAfter this their wedding was celebrated, and the lion was accepted back into favor, because, after all, he had told the truth."

He used to beg for his living. Whatever food he got as alms, he kept in an earthen pot and hung it beside his bed. Whenever he felt hungry he took out some food from the pot and ate it.\n\nOne night, the Brahmin lay on his bed and soon he was fast asleep. He began to dream-He was no longer a poor Brahmin.

Very soon the buffaloes and cows had their young ones. Those young ones grew and became buffaloes and cows. The buffaloes and cows gave milk. He made a lot of butter and curd from the milk. He sold butter and curd in the market. Soon he became richer then ever before. He built a big house for himself. Then he married a beautiful girl. Soon they had their children.

She had, by aformer husband, two daughters of her own humour and they were indeedexactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, ayoung daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper,which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in theworld.\n\nNo sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over, but the stepmotherbegan to shew herself in her colours. She could not bear the goodqualities of this pretty girl; and the less, because they made her owndaughters appear the more odious. She employed her in the meanest workof the house; she scoured the dishes, tables, &c. and rubbed Madam'schamber, and those of Misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorrygarret, upon a wretched straw-bed, while her sisters lay in finerooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion,and where they had looking-glasses so large, that they might seethemselves at their full length, from head to foot.\n\nThe poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, whowould have rattled her off; for his wife governed him intirely. Whenshe had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, andsit down among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be calledCinder-breech; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil asthe eldest, called her Cinderilla. However, Cinderilla,notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer thanher sisters, tho' they were always dressed very richly.\n\nIt happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all personsof fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited; for they cut avery grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted atthis invitation, and wonderfully busy in chusing out such gowns,petticoats, and head-clothes as might best become them. This was a newtrouble to Cinderilla; for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen,and plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but howthey should be dressed. \"For my part,\" said the eldest, \"I will wearmy red velvet suit, with French trimming.\" \"And I,\" said the youngest,\"shall only have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends forthat, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamondstomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in theworld.\" They sent for the best tire-woman they could get, to make uptheir head-dresses, and adjust their double-pinners,[3] and they hadtheir red brushes, and patches from the fashionable maker.\n\n[Footnote 3: 'Pinners' were coifs with two long side-flaps pinned on.'Double-pinners'--with two side-flaps on each side--accuratelytranslates the French cornettes à deux rangs.]\n\n[Illustration: \"ANY ONE BUT CINDERILLA WOULD HAVE DRESSED THEIR HEADSAWRY\"]\n\nCinderilla was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all thesematters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always forthe best, nay and offered her service to dress their heads, which theywere very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said toher:\n\n\"Cinderilla, would you not be glad to go to the ball?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said she, \"you only jeer at me; it is not for such as I am to gothither.\"\n\n\"Thou art in the right of it,\" replied they, \"it would make the peoplelaugh to see a Cinder-breech at a ball.\"\n\nAny one but Cinderilla would have dressed their heads awry, but shewas very good, and dressed them perfectly well. They were almost twodays without eating, so much they were transported with joy; theybroke above a dozen of laces in trying to be laced up close, that theymight have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at theirlooking-glass. At last the happy day came; they went to Court, andCinderilla followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and whenshe had lost sight of them she fell a-crying.\n\nHer godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was thematter.\n\n\"I wish I could----, I wish I could--;\" she was not able to speak therest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.\n\nThis godmother of hers, who was a Fairy, said to her:\n\n\"Thou wishest thou couldest go to the ball, is it not so?\"\n\n\"Y--es,\" cried Cinderilla, with a great sigh.\n\n\"Well,\" said her godmother, \"be but a good girl, and I will contrivethat thou shalt go.\" Then she took her into her chamber, and said toher:\n\n\"Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.\"\n\nCinderilla went immediately to gather the finest she could get, andbrought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how thispumpkin could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out allthe inside of it, leaving nothing but the rind; which done, she struckit with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a finecoach, gilded all over with gold.\n\nShe then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six miceall alive, and ordered Cinderilla to lift up a little the trap-door,when giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand,the mouse was at that moment turned into a fair horse, whichaltogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautifulmouse-coloured dapple-grey.\n\nBeing at a loss for a coachman, \"I will go and see,\" says Cinderilla,\"if there be never a rat in the rat-trap, that we may make a coachmanof him.\"\n\n\"Thou art in the right,\" replied her godmother; \"go and look.\"\n\nCinderilla brought the trap to her, and in it there were three hugerats. The Fairy made choice of one of the three, which had the largestbeard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fatjolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.\n\nAfter that, she said to her:\n\n\"Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind thewatering pot; bring them to me.\"\n\nShe had no sooner done so, but her godmother turned them into sixfootmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with theirliveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behindit, as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The Fairy thensaid to Cinderilla:\n\n\"Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are younot pleased with it?\"\n\n\"O yes,\" cried she, \"but must I go thither as I am, in these poisonnasty rags?\"\n\nHer godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the sameinstant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, allbeset with jewels. This done she gave her a pair of glass-slippers,[4]the prettiest in the whole world.\n\n[Footnote 4: In Perrault's tale: pantoufles de verre. There is nodoubt that in the medieval versions of this ancient tale Cinderillawas given pantoufles de vair--i.e., of a grey, or grey and white,fur, the exact nature of which has been a matter of controversy, butwhich was probably a grey squirrel. Long before the seventeenthcentury the word vair had passed out of use, except as a heraldicterm, and had ceased to convey any meaning to the people. Thus the_pantoufles de vair_ of the fairy tale became, in the oral tradition,the homonymous pantoufles de verre, or glass slippers, a delightfulimprovement on the earlier version.]\n\nBeing thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother,above all things, commanded her not to stay till after midnight,telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed at the ball onemoment longer, her coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice,her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become justas they were before.\n\nShe promised her godmother, she would not fail of leaving the ballbefore midnight; and then away she drove, scarce able to containherself for joy. The King's son, who was told that a great Princess,whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her hishand as she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the hall,among all the company. There was immediately a profound silence, theyleft off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive wasevery one to contemplate the singular beauty of this unknown newcomer. Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of,\n\n\"Ha! how handsome she is! Ha! how handsome she is!\"\n\nThe King himself, old as he was, could not help ogling her, andtelling the Queen softly, \"that it was a long time since he had seenso beautiful and lovely a creature.\" All the ladies were busied inconsidering her clothes and head-dress, that they might have some madenext day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with suchfine materials, and as able hands to make them.\n\nThe King's son conducted her to the most honourable seat, andafterwards took her out to dance with him: she danced so verygracefully, that they all more and more admired her. A fine collationwas served up, whereof the young Prince ate not a morsel, so intentlywas he busied in gazing on her. She went and sat down by her sisters,shewing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the orangesand citrons which the Prince had presented her with; which very muchsurprised them, for they did not know her.\n\nWhile Cinderilla was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clockstrike eleven and three quarters, whereupon she immediately made acurtesy to the company, and hasted away as fast as she could.\n\nBeing got home, she ran to seek out her godmother, and after havingthanked her, she said, \"she could not but heartily wish she might gonext day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her.\" As shewas eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, hertwo sisters knocked at the door which Cinderilla ran and opened.\n\n\"How long you have stayed,\" cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes, andstretching herself as if she had been just awaked out of her sleep;she had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since theywent from home.\n\n\"If thou hadst been at the ball,\" said one of her sisters, \"thouwouldst not have been tired with it; there came thither the finestPrincess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; sheshewed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.\"Cinderilla was transported with joy; she asked them the name of thatPrincess; but they told her they did not know it; and that the King'sson was very anxious to learn it, and would give all the world to knowwho she was. At this Cinderilla, smiling, replied:\n\n\"She must then be very beautiful indeed; Lord! how happy have youbeen; could not I see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me youryellow suit of cloaths which you wear every day!\"\n\n\"Ay, to be sure!\" cried Miss Charlotte, \"lend my cloaths to such adirty Cinder-breech as thou art; who's the fool then?\"\n\nCinderilla, indeed, expected some such answer, and was very glad ofthe refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it, if her sisterhad lent her what she asked for jestingly.\n\nThe next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderilla,but dressed more magnificently than before. The King's son was alwaysby her, and never ceased his compliments and amorous speeches to her;to whom all this was so far from being tiresome, that she quite forgotwhat her godmother had recommended to her, so that she, at last,counted the clock striking twelve, when she took it to be no more thaneleven; she then rose up, and fled as nimble as a deer.\n\nThe Prince followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind oneof her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. Shegot home, but quite out of breath, without coach or footmen, and inher nasty old cloaths, having nothing left her of all her finery, butone of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped. The guards atthe palace gate were asked if they had not seen a Princess go out; whosaid, they had seen nobody go out, but a young girl, very meanlydressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench, than agentle-woman.\n\n[Illustration: \"SHE LEFT BEHIND ONE OF HER GLASS SLIPPERS, WHICH THEPRINCE TOOK UP MOST CAREFULLY\"]\n\nWhen the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderilla asked them ifthey had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there. Theytold her, Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it strucktwelve, and with so much haste, that she dropped one of her littleglass slippers, the prettiest in the world, and which the King's sonhad taken up; that he had done nothing but look at it during all thelatter part of the ball, and that most certainly he was very much inlove with the beautiful person who owned the little slipper.\n\nWhat they said was very true; for a few days after, the King's soncaused it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet, that he would marryher whose foot this slipper would just fit. They whom he employedbegan to try it on upon the Princesses, then the duchesses, and allthe Court, but in vain. It was brought to the two sisters, who did allthey possibly could to thrust their feet into the slipper, but theycould not effect it.\n\nCinderilla, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to themlaughing:\n\n\"Let me see if it will not fit me?\"\n\nHer sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. Thegentleman who was sent to try the slipper, looked earnestly atCinderilla, and finding her very handsome, said it was but just thatshe should try, and that he had orders to let every one make tryal. Heinvited Cinderilla to sit down, and putting the slipper to her foot,he found it went on very easily, and fitted her, as if it had beenmade of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessivelygreat, but still abundantly greater, when Cinderilla pulled out of herpocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in cameher godmother, who having touched, with her wand, Cinderilla'scloaths, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those shehad before.\n\nAnd now her two sisters found her to be that fine beautiful lady whomthey had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet, to begpardon for all the ill treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderillatook them up, and as she embraced them, cried that she forgave themwith all her heart, and desired them always to love her.\n\nShe was conducted to the young Prince, dressed as she was; he thoughther more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.\n\nCinderilla, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisterslodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with twogreat lords of the court."

      "body": "The Trick Of The Crow:\n\nOnce upon a time, there stood a huge peepal tree on the outskirts of a small village. In this, tree there lived a pair of crows with their young ones. And at the root of the tree there lived a big black serpent in a deep hole. Every time the crows laid their eggs, the serpent crept up the tree and ate all the eggs and the young ones. With the result, the crows were never able to raise their young ones. This made the crows very sad. They didn't know how to get rid of the killer serpent.\n\nOne day, the crows went to a fox. The fox was their intimate friend.\n\n\"Hello dear friends, come in\", said the fox seeing the crows at his door, \"You two seem to be very sad. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"The root cause of our problem is a black serpent. He is after us. He eats up our e,ggs and the young ones. Please help us get rid of this bloody serperit,\" said the female crow to the fox.\n\nThe fox too was shocked to hear this sad story. She promised to help the crows.\n\nShe thought for a few minutes and then laid out a plan before the crows.\n\n\"Listen carefully\", said the fox, \"you know where the king's palace is situated. You've also seen the queen taking bath in an open swimming pool, inside the palace. The queen, while taking bath always removes all her ornaments and keeps them on a tray kept by the side of the pool. While she is busy taking her bath, you two swoop down upon the tray and pick up two diamond ornaments from it. Drop them into the serpent's hole. The servants of the queen will come chasing you and finding the ornaments into the serpent's hole, they will first kill the serpent to save them from being bitten by it and then will take the ornaments out of the hole. Thus, the serpent will be killed and you too will be saved from all the troubles of killing it by yourself.\"\n\nThis was a very bright idea. The crows liked it. They flew to the king's palace. There they saw the queen taking bath in a swimming pool. She had removed her ornaments and kept them in a tray. The crows swooped down upon the tray, picked up two expensive diamond necklaces from it and flew towards the snake's hole. The guards ran after the crows brandishing their sticks and swords. They chased the crows and soon reached that big peepal.tree, where the big black snake lived. They found the diamond necklaces, lying inside the serpent's hole. Afraid of the snake, they first killed the snake by sticks and swords and then took out the ornaments and returned to the palace.\n\nThe crows thanked the fox for his help and lived happily in the peepal tree, thereafter.\n\nMoral: Intelligence is greater than strength."

      "body": "The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman:\n\nHere lived in the Land of Oz two queerly made men who were the best of friends. They were so much happier when together that they were seldom apart; yet they liked to separate, once in a while, that they might enjoy the pleasure of meeting again.\n\nOne was a Scarecrow. That means he was a suit of blue Munchkin clothes, stuffed with straw, on top of which was fastened a round cloth head, filled with bran to hold it in shape. On the head were painted two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth. The Scarecrow had never been much of a success in scaring crows, but he prided himself on being a superior man, because he could feel no pain, was never tired and did not have to eat or drink. His brains were sharp, for the Wizard of Oz had put pins and needles in the Scarecrow’s brains.\n\nThe other man was made all of tin, his arms and legs and head being cleverly jointed so that he could move them freely. He was known as the Tin Woodman, having at one time been a woodchopper, and everyone loved him because the Wizard had given him an excellent heart of red plush.\n\nThe Tin Woodman lived in a magnificent tin castle, built on his country estate in the Winkie Land, not far from the Emerald City of Oz. It had pretty tin furniture and was surrounded by lovely gardens in which were many tin trees and beds of tin flowers. The palace of the Scarecrow was not far distant, on the banks of a river, and this palace was in the shape of an immense ear of corn.\n\nOne morning the Tin Woodman went to visit his friend the Scarecrow, and as they had nothing better to do they decided to take a boat ride on the river. So they got into the Scarecrow’s boat, which was formed from a big corncob, hollowed out and pointed at both ends and decorated around the edges with brilliant jewels. The sail was of purple silk and glittered gayly in the sunshine.\n\nThere was a good breeze that day, so the boat glided swiftly over the water. By and by they came to a smaller river that flowed from out a deep forest, and the Tin Woodman proposed they sail up this stream, as it would be cool and shady beneath the trees of the forest. So the Scarecrow, who was steering, turned the boat up the stream and the friends continued talking together of old times and the wonderful adventures they had met with while traveling with Dorothy, the little Kansas girl. They became so much interested in this talk that they forgot to notice that the boat was now sailing through the forest, or that the stream was growing more narrow and crooked.\n\nSuddenly the Scarecrow glanced up and saw a big rock just ahead of them.\n\n“Look out!” he cried; but the warning came too late.\n\nThe Tin Woodman sprang to his feet just as the boat bumped into the rock, and the jar made him lose his balance. He toppled and fell overboard and being made of tin he sank to the bottom of the water in an instant and lay there at full length, face up.\n\nImmediately the Scarecrow threw out the anchor, so as to hold the boat in that place, and then he leaned over the side and through the clear water looked at his friend sorrowfully.\n\n“Dear me!” he exclaimed; “what a misfortune!”\n\n“It is, indeed,” replied the Tin Woodman, speaking in muffled tones because so much water covered him. “I cannot drown, of course, but I must lie here until you find a way to get me out. Meantime, the water is soaking into all my joints and I shall become badly rusted before I am rescued.” \n\n“Very true,” agreed the Scarecrow; “but be patient, my friend, and I’ll dive down and get you. My straw will not rust, and is easily replaced, if damaged, so I’m not afraid of the water.”\n\nThe Scarecrow now took off his hat and made a dive from the boat into the water; but he was so light in weight that he barely dented the surface of the stream, nor could he reach the Tin Woodman with his outstretched straw arms. So he floated to the boat and climbed into it, saying the while:\n\n“Do not despair, my friend. We have an extra anchor aboard, and I will tie it around my waist, to make me sink, and dive again.”\n\n“Don’t do that!” called the tin man. “That would anchor you also to the bottom, where I am, and we’d both be helpless.”\n\n“True enough,” sighed the Scarecrow, wiping his wet face with a handkerchief; and then he gave a cry of astonishment, for he found he had wiped off one painted eye and now had but one eye to see with.\n\n“How dreadful!” said the poor Scarecrow. “That eye must have been painted in water-color, instead of oil. I must be careful not to wipe off the other eye, for then I could not see to help you at all.”\n\nA shriek of elfish laughter greeted this speech and looking up the Scarecrow found the trees full of black crows, who seemed much amused by the straw man’s one-eyed countenance. He knew the crows well, however, and they had usually been friendly to him because he had never deceived them into thinking he was a meat man—the sort of man they really feared.\n\n“Don’t laugh,” said he; “you may lose an eye yourselves some day.”\n\n“We couldn’t look as funny as you, if we did,” replied one old crow, the king of them. “But what has gone wrong with you?”\n\n“The Tin Woodman, my dear friend and companion, has fallen overboard and is now on the bottom of the river,” said the Scarecrow. “I’m trying to get him out again, but I fear I shall not succeed.”\n\n“Why, it’s easy enough,” declared the old crow. “Tie a string to him and all of my crows will fly down, take hold of the string, and pull him up out of the water. There are hundreds of us here, so our united strength could lift much more than that.”\n\n“But I can’t tie a string to him,” replied the Scarecrow. “My straw is so light that I am unable to dive through the water. I’ve tried it, and knocked one eye out.”\n\n“Can’t you fish for him?”\n\n“Ah, that is a good idea,” said the Scarecrow. “I’ll make the attempt.”\n\nHe found a fishline in the boat, with a stout hook at the end of it. No bait was needed, so the Scarecrow dropped the hook into the water till it touched the Woodman.\n\n“Hook it into a joint,” advised the crow, who was now perched upon a branch that stuck far out and bent down over the water.\n\nThe Scarecrow tried to do this, but having only one eye he could not see the joints very clearly.\n\n“Hurry up, please,” begged the Tin Woodman; “you’ve no idea how damp it is down here.”\n\n“Can’t you help?” asked the crow.\n\n“How?” inquired the tin man.\n\n“Catch the line and hook it around your neck.”\n\nThe Tin Woodman made the attempt and after several trials wound the line around his neck and hooked it securely.\n\n“Good!” cried the King Crow, a mischievous old fellow. “Now, then, we’ll all grab the line and pull you out.”\n\nAt once the air was filled with black crows, each of whom seized the cord with beak or talons. The Scarecrow watched them with much interest and forgot that he had tied the other end of the line around his own waist, so he would not lose it while fishing for his friend.\n\n“All together for the good caws!” shrieked the King Crow, and with a great flapping of wings the birds rose into the air.\n\nThe Scarecrow clapped his stuffed hands in glee as he saw his friend drawn from the water into the air; but the next moment the straw man was himself in the air, his stuffed legs kicking wildly; for the crows had flown straight up through the trees. On one end of the line dangled the Tin Woodman, hung by the neck, and on the other dangled the Scarecrow, hung by the waist and clinging fast to the spare anchor of the boat, which he had seized hoping to save himself. \n\n“Hi, there—be careful!” shouted the Scarecrow to the crows. “Don’t take us so high. Land us on the river bank.”\n\nBut the crows were bent on mischief. They thought it a good joke to bother the two, now that they held them captive.\n\n“Here’s where the crows scare the Scarecrow!” chuckled the naughty King Crow, and at his command the birds flew over the forest to where a tall dead tree stood higher than all the other trees. At the very top was a crotch, formed by two dead limbs, and into the crotch the crows dropped the center of the line. Then, letting go their hold, they flew away, chattering with laughter, and left the two friends suspended high in the air—one on each side of the tree.\n\nNow the Tin Woodman was much heavier than the Scarecrow, but the reason they balanced so nicely was because the straw man still clung fast to the iron anchor. There they hung, not ten feet apart, yet unable to reach the bare tree-trunk.\n\n“For goodness sake don’t drop that anchor,” said the Tin Woodman anxiously.\n\n“Why not?” inquired the Scarecrow.\n\n“If you did I’d tumble to the ground, where my tin would be badly dented by the fall. Also you would shoot into the air and alight somewhere among the tree-tops.”\n\n“Then,” said the Scarecrow, earnestly, “I shall hold fast to the anchor.”\n\nFor a time they both dangled in silence, the breeze swaying them gently to and fro. Finally the tin man said: “Here is an emergency, friend, where only brains can help us. We must think of some way to escape.”\n\n“I’ll do the thinking,” replied the Scarecrow. “My brains are the sharpest.”\n\nHe thought so long that the tin man grew tired and tried to change his position, but found his joints had already rusted so badly that he could not move them. And his oil-can was back in the boat.\n\n“Do you suppose your brains are rusted, friend Scarecrow?” he asked in a weak voice, for his jaws would scarcely move.\n\n“No, indeed. Ah, here’s an idea at last!”\n\nAnd with this the Scarecrow clapped his hands to his head, forgetting the anchor, which tumbled to the ground. The result was astonishing; for, just as the tin man had said, the light Scarecrow flew into the air, sailed over the top of the tree and landed in a bramble-bush, while the tin man fell plump to the ground, and landing on a bed of dry leaves was not dented at all. The Tin Woodman’s joints were so rusted, however, that he was unable to move, while the thorns held the Scarecrow a fast prisoner.\n\nWhile they were in this sad plight the sound of hoofs was heard and along the forest path rode the little Wizard of Oz, seated on a wooden Sawhorse. He smiled when he saw the one-eyed head of the Scarecrow sticking out of the bramble-bush, but he helped the poor straw man out of his prison.\n\n“Thank you, dear Wiz,” said the grateful Scarecrow. “Now we must get the oil-can and rescue the Tin Woodman.”\n\nTogether they ran to the river bank, but the boat was floating in midstream and the Wizard was obliged to mumble some magic words to draw it to the bank, so the Scarecrow could get the oil-can. Then back they flew to the tin man, and while the Scarecrow carefully oiled each joint the little Wizard moved the joints gently back and forth until they worked freely. After an hour of this labor the Tin Woodman was again on his feet, and although still a little stiff he managed to walk to the boat.\n\nThe Wizard and the Sawhorse also got aboard the corncob craft and together they returned to the Scarecrow’s palace. But the Tin Woodman was very careful not to stand up in the boat again."

He would seek advice from the wise and rule his kingdom aptly. Once an old sage visited his palace as a guest. He asked the old guru to reveal the formula to survive the worst of the time, if it ever befelled on him. The old sage wrote something on a piece of paper, folded and sealed it. Handing over, he said, \"keep this very close to you at all times. Only when you face a situation that is beyond you or when nothing else works and all is lost then open this and follow the formula.\" Saying this the sage left.\n\nYears went by and the worst situation had never arrived. But fate was not so kind to him. In a war with a warring ruler he was badly defeated and severely wounded. He had no choice but to escape from being captured and killed. Far away from the battlefield he rested and was enveloped in complete despair. He felt like dying but couldn't when he thought of his people who had faith in him. He couldn't let his citizens down.

Her father was so proud of her that he boasted about her cleverness at home and abroad. He could not keep his tongue still about it. One day he was boasting to one of his neighbors, and he said, \"The girl is so clever that not even the King himself could ask her a question she couldn't answer, or read her a riddle she couldn't unravel.\"\n\nNow it so chanced the King was sitting at a window near by, and he overheard what the girl's father was saying. The next day he sent for the man to come before him. \"I hear you have a daughter who is so clever that no one in the kingdom can equal her; and is that so?\" asked the King.\n\nYes, it was no more than the truth. Too much could not be said of her wit and cleverness.\n\nThat was well, and the King was glad to hear it. He had thirty eggs; they were fresh and good, but it would take a clever person to hatch chickens out of them. He then bade his chancellor get the eggs and give them to the man.\n\n\"Take these home to your daughter,\" said the King, \"and bid her hatch them out for me. If she succeeds she shall have a bag of money for her pains, but if she fails you shall be beaten as a vain boaster.\"\n\nThe man was troubled when he heard this. Still his daughter was so clever he was almost sure she could hatch out the eggs. He carried them home to her and told her exactly what the King had said, and it did not take the girl long to find out that the eggs had been boiled.\n\nWhen she told her father that, he made a great to-do. That was a pretty trick for the King to have played upon him. Now he would have to take a beating and all the neighbors would hear about it. Would to Heaven he had never had a daughter at all if that was what came of it.\n\nThe girl, however, bade him be of good cheer. \"Go to bed and sleep quietly,\" said she. \"I will think of some way out of the trouble. No harm shall come to you, even though I have to go to the palace myself and take the beating in your place.\"\n\nThe next day the girl gave her father a bag of boiled beans and bade him take them out to a certain place where the King rode by every day. \"Wait until you see him coming,\" said she, \"and then begin to sow the beans.\" At the same time he was to call out this, that, and the other so loudly that the King could not help but hear him.\n\nThe man took the bag of beans and went out to the field his daughter had spoken of. He waited until he saw the King coming, and then he began to sow the beans, and at the same time to cry aloud, \"Come sun, come rain! Heaven grant that these boiled beans may yield me a good crop.\"\n\nThe King was surprised that any one should be so stupid as to think boiled beans would grow and yield a crop. He did not recognize the man, for he had only seen him once, and he stopped his horse to speak to him. \"My poor man,\" said he, \"how can you expect boiled beans to grow? Do you not know that that is impossible?\"\n\n\"Whatever the King commands should be possible,\" answered the man, \"and if chickens can hatch from boiled eggs why should not boiled beans yield a crop?\"\n\nWhen the King heard this he looked at the man more closely, and then he recognized him as the father of the clever daughter.\n\n\"You have indeed a clever daughter,\" said he. \"Take your beans home and bring me back the eggs I gave you.\"\n\nThe man was very glad when he heard that, and made haste to obey. He carried the beans home and then took the eggs and brought them back to the palace of the King.\n\nAfter the King had received the eggs he gave the man a handful of flax. \"Take this to your clever daughter,\" he said, \"and bid her make for me within the week a full set of sails for a large ship. If she does this she shall receive the half of my kingdom as a reward, but if she fails you shall have a drubbing that you will not soon forget.\"\n\nThe man returned to his home, loudly lamenting his hard lot.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked his daughter. \"Has the King set another task that I must do?\"\n\nYes, that he had; and her father showed her the flax the King had sent her and gave her the message.\n\n\"Do not be troubled,\" said the girl. \"No harm shall come to you. Go to bed and sleep quietly, and to-morrow I will send the King an answer that will satisfy him.\"\n\nThe man believed what his daughter said. He went to bed and slept quietly.\n\nThe next day the girl gave her father a small piece of wood. \"Carry this to the King,\" said she. \"Tell him I am ready to make the sails, but first let him make me of this wood a large ship that I may fit the sails to it.\"\n\nThe father did as the girl bade him, and the King was surprised at the cleverness of the girl in returning him such an answer.\n\n\"That is all very well,\" said he, \"and I will excuse her from this task. But here! Here is a glass mug. Take it home to your clever daughter. Tell her it is my command that she dip out the waters from the ocean bed so that I can ride over the bottom dry shod. If she does this, I will take her for my wife, but if she fails you shall be beaten within an inch of your life.\"\n\nThe man took the mug and hastened home, weeping aloud and bemoaning his fate.\n\n\"Well, and what is it?\" asked his daughter. \"What does the King demand of me now?\"\n\nThe man gave her the glass mug and told her what the King had said.\n\n\"Do not be troubled,\" said the girl. \"Go to bed and sleep in peace. You shall not be beaten, and soon I shall be reigning as Queen over all this land.\"\n\nThe man had trust in her. He went to bed and slept and dreamed he saw her sitting by the King with a crown on her head.\n\nThe next day the girl gave her father a bunch of tow. \"Take this to the King,\" she said. \"Tell him you have given me the mug, and I am willing to dip the sea dry, but first let him take this tow and stop up all the rivers that flow into the ocean.\"\n\nThe man did as his daughter bade him. He took the tow to the King and told him exactly what the girl had said.\n\nThen the King saw that the girl was indeed a clever one, and he sent for her to come before him.\n\nShe came just as she was, in her homespun dress and her rough shoes and with a cap on her head, but for all her mean clothing she was as pretty and fine as a flower, and the King was not slow to see it. Still he wanted to make sure for himself that she was as clever as her messages had been.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said he, \"what sound can be heard the farthest throughout the world?\"\n\n\"The thunder that echoes through heaven and earth,\" answered the girl, \"and your own royal commands that go from lip to lip.\"\n\nThis reply pleased the King greatly. \"And now tell me,\" said he, \"exactly what is my royal sceptre worth?\"\n\n\"It is worth exactly as much as the power for which it stands,\" the girl replied.\n\nThe King was so well satisfied with the way the girl answered that he no longer hesitated; he determined that she should be his Queen, and that they should be married at once.\n\nThe girl had something to say to this, however. \"I am but a poor girl,\" said she, \"and my ways are not your ways. It may well be that you will tire of me, or that you may be angry with me sometime, and send me back to my father's house to live. Promise that if this should happen you will allow me to carry back with me from the castle the thing that has grown most precious to me.\"\n\nThe King was willing to agree to this, but the girl was not satisfied until he had written down his promise and signed it with his own royal hand. Then she and the King were married with the greatest magnificence, and she came to live in the palace and reign over the land.\n\nNow while the girl was still only a peasant she had been well content to dress in homespun and live as a peasant should, but after she became Queen she would wear nothing but the most magnificent robes and jewels and ornaments, for that seemed to her only right and proper for a Queen. But the King, who was of a very jealous nature, thought his wife did not care at all for him, but only for the fine things he could give her.\n\nOne time the King and Queen were to ride abroad together, and the Queen spent so much time in dressing herself that the King was kept waiting, and he became very angry. When she appeared before him, he would not even look at her. \"You care nothing for me, but only for the jewels and fine clothes you wear,\" he cried. \"Take with you those that are the most precious to you, as I promised you, and return to your father's house. I will no longer have a wife who cares only for my possessions and not at all for me.\"\n\nVery well; the girl was willing to go. \"And I will be happier in my father's house than I was when I first met you,\" said she. Nevertheless she begged that she might spend one more night in the palace, and that she and the King might sup together once again before she returned home.\n\nTo this the King agreed, for he still loved her, even though he was so angry with her.\n\nSo he and his wife supped together that evening, and just at the last the Queen took a golden cup and filled it with wine. Then, when the King was not looking, she put a sleeping potion in the wine and gave it to him to drink.\n\nHe took it and drank to the very last drop, suspecting nothing, but soon after he sank down among the cushions in a deep sleep. Then the Queen caused him to be carried to her father's house and laid in the bed there.\n\nWhen the King awoke the next morning he was very much surprised to find himself in the peasant's cottage. He raised himself upon his elbow to look about him, and at once the girl came to the bedside, and she was again dressed in the coarse and common clothes she had worn before she was married.\n\n\"What means this?\" asked the King, \"and how came I here?\"\n\n\"My dear husband,\" said the girl, \"your promise was that if you ever sent me back to my father's house I might carry with me the thing that had become most precious to me in the castle. You are that most precious thing, and I care for nothing else except as it makes me pleasing in your sight.\"\n\nThen the King could no longer feel jealous or angry with her. He clasped her in his arms, and they kissed each other tenderly. That same day they returned to the palace, and from that time on the King and his peasant Queen lived together in the greatest love and happiness."

      "body": "Thumbelina:\n\nA long time ago and far, far away an old woman was sitting in her rocking chair thinking how happy she would be if she had a child. Then, she heard a knock at the door and opened it. A lady was standing there and she said, \"If you let me in, I will grant you a wish.\" The old woman let the woman in firstly because she felt pity, secondly because she knew what she'd wish for...a child. After she washed the lady up and fed her, she saw that she was really beautiful.\n\nThe lady slept soundly all night long and then right before she left, she said, \"Now, about your wish. What do you want?\"\n\nThe lady thought about most people's wishes to be richest in the world, most powerful person, the smartest, and the prettiest. But the old woman wished for \nsomething the lady could not believe. She said, \"I would like a child.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" she asked because she was astonished at what the old lady asked for. The old lady repeated what she said. \"I would like a child.\"\n\nThe lady then placed a tiny seed in the old woman's hand and gave her instructions. \" Plant this seed, water it carefully, watch over it, and give it your love. If you do all those things, then you will have a child.\"\n\nSo the old woman did all of those things the lady had told her to. In a week, there was a beautiful yellow flower in place of the seed. The next day, the flower bloomed. Inside the flower was a beautiful little girl who was the size of the woman's thumb so she a called her Thumbellina. She made her a little dress out of golden threads. Thumbellina slept in a walnut shell and brought the old woman joy and happiness.\n\nBut, one day when Thumbellina went down for her nap, a frog hopped through the open window and said, \"You will be a perfect bride for my son,\" and she took Thumbellina to a lily pad and hopped off to find her son.\n\nThumbellina cried and some little guppies heard her and chewed the roots off the lily pad to help her escape. Thumbellina's lily pad floated away. A few hours later, she finally stopped floating. During the summer, she ate berries and drank the dew off the leaves. But then winter came and she needed shelter. A kindly mouse let her stay with it, but it said, \"You'll have to marry my friend, Mole, because I cannot keep you for another winter.\"\n\nThe next day she went to see Mole. In one of tunnels, she found a sick bird and said, \"Poor thing, I will bury it.\" Then she found out that it was still alive and she cared for it until was ready to fly. It flew off. That fall she nearly had to marry Mole. But then she heard a familiar tweet and an idea popped up in the bird's head.\n\n\"You can come down to the warm country,\" said the bird, so Thumbellina hopped on the bird's back and flew to the warm country. The people there who were like her renamed her Erin. She married a prince and she lived happily ever after."

One day, he stumbled on a broken pot in a drunken state and fell down. The sharp edge of the broken pot pierced his forehead and he started bleeding profusely. He didn't care much for his wound. The wound got worse. Even after it had healed, it had left a big scar on his forehead.\n\nAfter sometime, there was a famine in the country. The potter lost his business. He, then, left for some other part of the country. There he, somehow, got himself employed in the king's service.\n\nOnce, the king noticed the big scar on the forehead of the potter, he thought to himself that the potter must be a brave man. The scar was most probably the result of his face to face fight with some soldier of the enemy.\n\nSo, the king decided to place the potter amongst his chosen army generals. As the war was impending, the king decided to bestow honour on generals to encourage them.\n\nLater the king decided to make the potter the chief of the army. So he asked the potter, \"General, what's your name? How did you get this scar on your forehead? What was the name of the battle you fought in?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" replied the potter, \"I'm a potter by profession. Once I fell down on a broken pot in a drunken state and got wounded. This scar is the result of that wound.\"\n\nHearing this, the king was very much dejected. He ordered his soldiers to throw the potter out of the army.\n\nThe potter begged for king's forgiveness.

When it was time for the lapwing's wife to lay eggs, she said to her husband. \"I don't want to lay eggs here on the sea shore. The sea might eat up my eggs. Let us go to some pond or lake.\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish\", said the lapwing. \"Even our ancestors laid eggs here. Let the sea eat our eggs.

But when she came back to the sea-shore, she was shocked to see all her eggs missing. She began to weep. When the lapwing came to know about it, he became red with rage. He called a meeting of all the birds and narrated to them the unjust and cruel exercise of power by the sea. Addressing all the other birds around him, he said, \"Today the sea has swept away our eggs. Tomorrow it might be your turn.\"\n\nThe birds understood the logic and became highly upset over this incidence. They decided to meet their king, the eagle.

      "body": "The Old Greedy Crane:\n\nThere was an old crane, who lived by a lake. He was so old that he could not arrange for his food. The fish swam around him, but he was so weak that he could not catch them.\n\nOne day, he was very hungry. He hadn't had anything to eat for days together. In total dejection he sat on the bank of the lake and began weeping. A crab who was passing by, heard him crying and asked him for the reason.\n\nAll of a sudden, he hit upon an idea. He asked the crab to have patience and allow him some time to overcome his emotion. The crab consoled him and became silent. Meanwhile, the crane pretended to have overcome his emotions and began saying in a sad tone, \"Perhaps, you are not aware of the future of the acquatic animals of this lake. They will soon die without water.\"\n\n\"What!\" the crab exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes\", the crane said. \"A fortune teller has told me that very soon this lake will go dry and all the creatures living in it will die. This thought of impending doom has sunken my heart with grief.\" After a pause, the crane continued, \"There is another lake at some distance from here. All the big creatures like crocodiles, tortoises, frogs etc. can travel upto that lake, but I am worried about those, who cannot travel by land, like fish. They will die without water. This is the reason why I am so sad. I want to help them.\"\n\nAll the creatures in the lake were dumbstruck to know the future of the lake but they became very happy to know that the crane was ready to help them.\n\n\"There is a big lake, full of water, a few miles away from here. I'll carry such helpless creatures on my back\", said the crane, \"and put them safely in the big lake.\"\n\nEveryone in the lake agreed to this proposal. Now the crane started carrying one creature at a time, on his back. First, he started with fish and carried them on his back; but, instead of taking them to the big lake, he took them to a nearby hill and ate them.\n\nAnd in this way, the crane ate a large number of fish everyday.\n\nWithin a few days, he regained his health and became stout.\n\nOne day, the crab said to the crane, \"Friend, you seem to have forgotten me. I thought, I would be the first one to be carried to the big lake, but I have a feeling that I have been completely ignored.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't forgotten you\", said the crane cunningly. He was tired of eating fish everyday. He wanted to have a change. So he said to the crab, \"Come my friend. Sit on my back\"\n\nThe crab gladly sat on the crane's back and the crane flew towards the big lake.\n\n\"How far is the lake now?\" the crab asked. The crane thought that the crab was quite an innocent creature. He would never know his evil plans. So, he said angrily, \"You fool, do you think I am your servant? There is no other lake around here. I made this plan in order to be able to eat you all. Now you too be prepared to die.\"\n\nBut the crab didn't loose his senses. He quickly grabbed the long neck of the crane with his sharp claws and told him to return to the old lake. He threatened to cut the crane's neck into two, if he didn't obey him.\n\nThe crane was left with no choice, but to return to the old lake On reaching the lake the crab immediately jumped off the back of the crane. Then he told all the other creatures about the crane's misdeeds. This made the creatures very angry. They attacked the crane and killed him.\n\nMoral: Never be greedy."

      "body": "The Heart Of A Monkey:\n\nA long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff.\n\nOf course the people had taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. The branches of the tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big grey monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight.\n\nAfter he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water. While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch comfortably he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes.\n\n'Can I do anything for you, my friend?' asked the monkey politely.\n\n'Oh! if you only would thrown me down some of those delicious things, I should be so grateful,' answered the shark. 'After you have lived on fish for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so very, very tired of the taste of salt.'\n\n'Well, I don't like salt myself,' said the monkey; 'so if you will open your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it,' and, as he spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so easy to hit the shark's mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better luck, and the fruit fell right in.\n\n'Ah, how good!' cried the shark. 'Send me another, please.' And the monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating them.\n\n'It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children,' he said, at length, 'but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you another treat.'\n\n'Thank you, thank you,' said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth as he grinned with delight; 'you can't guess how happy you have made me,' and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the monkey came again.\n\nFor weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how to teach them all they ought to know. By and bye the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from the shark. The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater marvels, and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy.\n\nMatters were in this state when one day the shark said: 'I really hardly know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks. Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen to take your fancy.'\n\n'I should like nothing better,' cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as they always did when he was pleased. 'But how could I get there? Not by water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!'\n\n'Oh! don't let that trouble you,' replied the shark, 'you have only to sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you.'\n\nSo it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark swam close up under the tree and the monkey dropped neatly on his back, without even a splash. After a few minutes--for at first he felt a little frightened at his strange position--the monkey began to enjoy himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish and the sea-weeds and the oddly-shaped things that floated past them, and as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself.\n\nThe sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, 'My friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I should tell you something.'\n\n'What is it?' asked the monkey. 'Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you sound rather grave?'\n\n'Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure him is a monkey's heart.'\n\n'Poor man, I am very sorry for him,' replied the monkey; 'but you were unwise not to tell me till we had started.'\n\n'What do you mean?' asked the shark; but the monkey, who now understood the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he should say.\n\n'Why are you so silent?' inquired the shark again.\n\n'I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me.'\n\n'Your heart! Why isn't your heart here?' said the shark, with a puzzled expression.\n\n'Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don't know that when we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being troublesome? However, perhaps you won't believe that, and will just think I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you find it you can kill me.'\n\nThe monkey spoke in such a calm, indifferent way that the shark was quite deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry.\n\n'But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you,' he said at last. 'We had better turn back to the town, and then you can fetch it.'\n\nOf course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not to seem too pleased.\n\n'Well, I don't know,' he remarked carelessly, 'it is such a long way; but you may be right.'\n\n'I am sure I am,' answered the shark, 'and I will swim as quickly as I can,' and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree hanging over the water.\n\nWith a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and swung himself up.\n\n'Wait for me here,' he called out to the shark. 'I am so hungry I must have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart,' and he went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep.\n\n'Are you there?' cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about under the cliff, and was in haste to be gone.\n\nThe monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer.\n\n'Are you there?' called the shark again, louder than before, and in a very cross voice.\n\n'Oh, yes. I am here,' replied the monkey; 'but I wish you had not wakened me up. I was having such a nice nap.'\n\n'Have you got it?' asked the shark. 'It is time we were going.'\n\n'Going where?' inquired the monkey.\n\n'Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You CAN'T have forgotten!'\n\n'My dear friend,' answered the monkey, with a chuckle, 'I think you must be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman's donkey?'\n\n'Don't talk nonsense,' exclaimed the shark, who did not like being laughed at. 'What do you mean about a washerman's donkey? And I wish you would be quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan.'\n\n'Did you really never hear of the washerman's donkey?' asked the monkey, who was enjoying himself immensely. 'Why, he is the beast who has no heart. And as I am not feeling very well, and am afraid to start while the sun is so high lest I should get a sunstroke, if you like, I will come a little nearer and tell you his story.'\n\n'Very well,' said the shark sulkily, 'if you won't come, I suppose I may as well listen to that as do nothing.'\n\nSo the monkey began.\n\n'A washerman once lived in the great forest on the other side of the town, and he had a donkey to keep him company and to carry him wherever he wanted to go. For a time they got on very well, but by and bye the donkey grew lazy and ungrateful for her master's kindness, and ran away several miles into the heart of the forest, where she did nothing but eat and eat and eat, till she grew so fat she could hardly move.\n\n'One day as she was tasting quite a new kind of grass and wondering if it was as good as what she had had for dinner the day before, a hare happened to pass by.\n\n'Well, that is a fat creature,' thought she, and turned out of her path to tell the news to a lion who was a friend of hers. Now the lion had been very ill, and was not strong enough to go hunting for himself, and when the hare came and told him that a very fat donkey was to be found only a few hundred yards off, tears of disappointment and weakness filled his eyes.\n\n'What is the good of telling me that?' he asked, in a weepy voice; 'you know I cannot even walk as far as that palm.'\n\n'Never mind,' answered the hare briskly. 'If you can't go to your dinner your dinner shall come to you,' and nodding a farewell to the lion she went back to the donkey.\n\n'Good morning,' said she, bowing politely to the donkey, who lifted her head in surprise. 'Excuse my interrupting you, but I have come on very important business.'\n\n'Indeed,' answered the donkey, 'it is most kind of you to take the trouble. May I inquire what the business is?'\n\n'Certainly,' replied the hare. 'It is my friend the lion who has heard so much of your charms and good qualities that he has sent me to beg that you will give him your paw in marriage. He regrets deeply that he is unable to make the request in person, but he has been ill and is too weak to move.'\n\n'Poor fellow! How sad!' said the donkey. 'But you must tell him that I feel honoured by his proposal, and will gladly consent to be Queen of the Beasts.'\n\n'Will you not come and tell him so yourself?' asked the hare.\n\n'Side by side they went down the road which led to the lion's house. It took a long while, for the donkey was so fat with eating she could only walk very slowly, and the hare, who could have run the distance in about five minutes, was obliged to creep along till she almost dropped with fatigue at not being able to go at her own pace. When at last they arrived the lion was sitting up at the entrance, looking very pale and thin. The donkey suddenly grew shy and hung her head, but the lion put on his best manners and invited both his visitors to come in and make themselves comfortable.\n\n'Very soon the hare got up and said, 'Well, as I have another engagement I will leave you to make acquaintance with your future husband,' and winking at the lion she bounded away.\n\n'The donkey expected that as soon as they were left alone the lion would begin to speak of their marriage, and where they should live, but as he said nothing she looked up. To her surprise and terror she saw him crouching in the corner, his eyes glaring with a red light, and with a loud roar he sprang towards her. But in that moment the donkey had had time to prepare herself, and jumping on one side dealt the lion such a hard kick that he shrieked with the pain. Again and again he struck at her with his claws, but the donkey could bite too, as well as the lion, who was very weak after his illness, and at last a well- planted kick knocked him right over, and he rolled on the floor, groaning with pain. The donkey did not wait for him to get up, but ran away as fast as she could and was lost in the forest.\n\n'Now the hare, who knew quite well what would happen, had not gone to do her business, but hid herself in some bushes behind the cave, where she could hear quite clearly the sounds of the battle. When all was quiet again she crept gently out, and stole round the corner.\n\n'Well, lion, have you killed her?' asked she, running swiftly up the path.\n\n'Killed her, indeed!' answered the lion sulkily, 'it is she who has nearly killed me. I never knew a donkey could kick like that, though I took care she should carry away the marks of my claws.'\n\n'Dear me! Fancy such a great fat creature being able to fight!' cried the hare. 'But don't vex yourself. Just lie still, and your wounds will soon heal,' and she bade her friend, good bye, and returned to her family.\n\n'Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey's back showed where the lion's claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever. He was beginning to think that it was almost time for him to begin hunting again, when one morning a rustle was heard in the creepers outside, and the hare's head peeped through.\n\n'Ah! there is no need to ask how you are,' she said. 'Still you mustn't overtire yourself, you know. Shall I go and bring you your dinner?'\n\n'If you will bring me that donkey I will tear it in two,' cried the lion savagely, and the hare laughed and nodded and went on her errand.\n\n'This time the donkey was much further than before, and it took longer to find her. At last the hare caught sight of four hoofs in the air, and ran towards them. The donkey was lying on a soft cool bed of moss near a stream, rolling herself backwards and forwards from pleasure.\n\n'Good morning,' said the hare politely, and the donkey got slowly on to her legs, and looked to see who her visitor could be.\n\n'Oh, it is you, is it?' she exclaimed. 'Come and have a chat. What news have you got?'\n\n'I mustn't stay,' answered the hare; 'but I promised the lion to beg you to pay him a visit, as he is not well enough to call on you.'\n\n'Well, I don't know,' replied the donkey gloomily, 'the last time we went he scratched me very badly, and really I was quite afraid.'\n\n'He was only trying to kiss you,' said the hare, 'and you bit him, and of course that made him cross.'\n\n'If I were sure of that,' hesitated the donkey.\n\n'Oh, you may be quite sure,' laughed the hare. 'I have a large acquaintance among lions. But let us be quick,' and rather unwillingly the donkey set out.\n\n'The lion saw them coming and hid himself behind a large tree. As the donkey went past, followed by the hare, he sprang out, and with one blow of his paw stretched the poor foolish creature dead before him.\n\n'Take this meat and skin it and roast it,' he said to the hare; 'but my appetite is not so good as it was, and the only part I want for myself is the heart. The rest you can either eat yourself or give away to your friends.'\n\n'Thank you,' replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and roasted it. As soon as it was cooked the hare took out the heart and had just finished eating it when the lion, who was tired of waiting, came up.\n\n'I am hungry,' said he. 'Bring me the creature's heart; it is just what I want for supper.'\n\n'But there is no heart,' answered the hare, looking up at the lion with a puzzled face.\n\n'What nonsense!' said the lion. 'As if every beast had not got a heart. What do you mean?'\n\n'This is a washerman's donkey,' replied the hare gravely.\n\n'Well, and suppose it is?'\n\n'Oh, fie!' exclaimed the hare. 'You, a lion and a grown-up person, and ask questions like that. If the donkey had had a heart would she be here now? The first time she came she knew you were trying to kill her, and ran away. Yet she came back a second time. Well, if she had had a heart would she have come back a second time? Now would she?'\n\n'And the lion answered slowly, 'No, she would not.'\n\n'So you think I am a washerman's donkey?' said the monkey to the shark, when the story was ended. 'You are wrong; I am not. And as the sun is getting low in the sky, it is time for you to begin your homeward journey. You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan better. Farewell!' And the monkey disappeared among the green branches, and was gone."

      "body": "Somilaka The Weaver:\n\nLong, long ago, there lived a weaver in a town by the name of Somilaka. The cloth he wove was so fine and beautiful that even the king liked it. But somehow, he still remained a poor man, while other weavers were quite rich, even though they wove inferior cloth. This bitter fact made Somilaka sad. He left his native village and went to settle down in some other town to try his luck. In this town also, Somilaka couldn't earn much money. He became frustrated and decided to commit suicide. He made a rope of grass, prepared a noose and tied the rope's other end to the high branch of a tree. He put the noose round his neck. As he was about to jump on to the ground, he heard a voice from the heaven calling, \"Hold it, don't commit suicide. It is I, God. I'm pleased with your hard work. Ask any boon of me and I'll grant it.\"\n\n\"Please give me a lot of wealth,\" said Somilaka. He was astonished to see God before him.\n\n\"But, what will you do with a lot of wealth?\" asked God. \"You don't need a lot of wealth, no more than what is required for your food and clothing.\"\n\n\"But I want a lot of wealth even then,\" replied Somilaka. \"A man with money is respected everywhere, whether he spends it or not.\"\n\nSeeing that Somilaka was adamant on his demand, God said, \"First go to your native town and meet the two traders living there. One is known as 'Secret Wealth' and the other as 'Useful Wealth'.\"\n\nSomilaka became very happy. He went back to his native town. There he decided to first observe the 'Secret wealth's living.\n\nWhen 'Secret Wealth' saw Somilaka, he became very angry. He talked to Somilaka in an abusive language. 'Secret Wealth's wife offered him food in a broken plate. She also banged the glass of water on the floor. Somilaka didn't utter a word. He ate his food and thanked the family members of 'Secret Wealth' and left quietly. Then he went to meet 'Useful Wealth' trader.\n\n'Useful Wealth' was much delighted to see Somilaka. Even the other members of his house welcomed him. They served him with delicious food. They talked to him in a friendly tone. At night, proper arrangements were made for him to take rest.\n\nEarly next morning, the king's servants arrived and brought money for 'Useful Wealth.'\n\nWhen Somilaka observed this, he thought to himself: \"This 'Useful Wealth’ is not a wealthy man, but even then he lives more comfortably than the 'Secret Wealth'.\"\n\nHis wish for a lot of money was granted by God. He began to enjoy his wealth to the full, just like 'Useful Wealth.'\n\nMoral: Wealth must be used properly. Where necessary it must also be donated."

      "body": "Snow-white And Rose-red:\n\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was nothing to do.\n\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said: ‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we live,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the other.’\n\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\n\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not worry on their account.\n\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children.\n\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings.\n\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said: ‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door.\n\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’\n\n‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out: ‘Leave me alive, children,\n\n'Snow-white, Rose-red,  Will you beat your wooer dead?'\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\n\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived.\n\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white. ‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.’\n\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees.\n\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\n\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to, little man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the dwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’\n\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You senseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’ ‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\n\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children.\n\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in. They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said Rose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such a fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\n\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people. I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\n\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\n\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go. As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their business in town.\n\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared at them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again.\n\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in gold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.\n\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red."

      "body": "The King's Treasure:\n\nAccurately relating how a marked advance in material and political prosperity accrued to Abdul Karim, and the part played by a monarch whose philosophy included the immediate advancement of a worthy subject.\n\nA Laboring man named Abdul Karim, with his wife, Zeeba \"the beautiful one\" lived in a sheltered valley, surrounded by hills, the sides of which were covered with fine gardens, in which the peach, the grape, the mulberry, and other delicious fruits grew in great profusion.\n\nAlthough his wife's name was Zeeba, as a matter of fact, she was very plain in appearance. But from having been named Zeeba, she really thought she was beautiful, and thus it came about that, moved by vanity, her two children were named, the boy, Yusuf, or Joseph, who as you know, was sold by his brethren into Egypt and became next to the King; and the girl, Fatima, after Fatima, the favorite daughter of Mahomet, and the wife of the famous Ali.\n\nNow Abdul Karim was only a laborer on the land, receiving no wages, merely being paid in grain and cloth sufficient for the wants of himself and family. Of money he knew nothing except by name.\n\nOne day his master was so pleased with his work that he actually gave him ten \"krans,\" equivalent to about a dollar of our money. To Abdul Karim this seemed great wealth, and directly his day's work was done, he ran home to his wife and said: \"Look, Zeeba, there's riches for you!\" and spread out the money before her. His good wife was delighted, and so were the children.\n\nThen Abdul Karim said: \"How shall we spend this great sum? The master has also given me a day's holiday, so if you don't mind, I will go to the famous city of Meshed, which is only twenty miles from here, and after placing two krans on the shrine of the holy Imam, I will then visit the bazaars and buy everything you and the children desire.\"\n\n\"You would better buy me a piece of silk for a new dress,\" said Zeeba.\n\n\"I want a fine horse and a sword,\" said little Yusuf.\n\n\"I would like an Indian handkerchief and a pair of gold slippers,\" said Fatima.\n\n\"They shall be here by to-morrow night,\" said the father, and taking a big stick, he set off on his journey.\n\nWhen he had come down from the mountains to the plain below, Abdul Karim saw stretched before him the glorious city, and was lost in wonder at the sight of the splendid domes, where roofs glittered with gold, and the minarets, from the tops of which the priests were calling the people to prayer.\n\nThen coming to the gate of the shrine, he asked an old priest if he might enter. \"Yes, my son,\" was the reply. \"Go in and give what thou canst spare to the mosque, and Allah will reward thee.\"\n\nSo Abdul Karim walked through the great court, amidst worshipers from every city in Asia. With open-mouthed astonishment he gazed on the riches of the temple, the jewels, the lovely carpets, the silks, the golden ornaments, and with humility he placed his two pieces of money on the sacred tomb. Then through the noise and bustle of the crowded streets, he went until he found the bazaars.\n\nHe found the sellers of fruits in one place, in another those who sold pots and pans, then he came to the jewelers, the bakers, the butchers, each trade having its own part of the bazaar, and so on, until he reached that part where there were only those who sold silks.\n\nHe entered one of the shops and asked to see some silks, and after much picking and choosing, fixed upon a superb piece of purple silk with an embroidered border of exquisite design. \"I will take this,\" he said. \"What is the price?\"\n\n\"I shall only ask you two hundred krans, as you are a new customer,\" said the shopkeeper. \"Anybody else but you would have to pay three or four hundred.\"\n\n\"Two hundred krans,\" repeated Abdul Karim, in astonishment. \"Surely you have made a mistake. Do you mean krans like these?\" taking one out of his pocket.\n\n\"Certainly I do,\" replied the shopkeeper, \"and let me tell you it is very cheap at that price.\"\n\nAbdul Karim pictured the disappointment of his wife. \"Poor Zeeba,\" he sighed.\n\n\"Poor who?\" said the silk merchant.\n\n\"My wife,\" said Abdul Karim.\n\n\"What have I to do with your wife?\" asked the merchant, getting angry because he saw that all his trouble was in vain.\n\n\"I will tell you about it,\" said Abdul Karim. \"Because I did my work well, my master gave me ten krans, the first time I ever have had any money. After giving two krans to the shrine, I intended to buy a piece of silk for my wife, a horse and sword for my little boy Yusuf, and an Indian handkerchief and a pair of gold slippers for my little girl Fatima. And here you ask me two hundred krans for one piece of silk. How can I pay you and buy the other things?\"\n\n\"Here I have been wasting my time and rumpling my beautiful silks for a fool like you,\" cried the angry merchant. \"Get out of my shop! Go home to your stupid Zeeba and your stupid children. Buy them some stale cakes and some black sugar, and don't put your head in my shop again, or it will be worse for you.\"\n\nThen he took off his slipper, and with many blows drove poor Abdul Karim out into the street. Then Abdul Karim went to the horse market, only to find that the lowest-priced horse would cost two hundred and fifty krans.\n\nThe horse dealer mocked him when they found he had only eight krans, and suggested that he buy the sixteenth part of a donkey for his little son. As for a sword, he found that it would cost at least thirty krans; while a pair of golden slippers would run into many hundreds of krans; and for an Indian handkerchief, the price was twelve krans.\n\nAs poor Abdul Karim bent his weary way home, he met a beggar crying: \"Dear friend, give me something, for to-morrow is Friday\"--the Mahommedan Sunday. \"He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, and of a certainty the Lord will pay him back a hundredfold.\"\n\n\"Of all the men I have met to-day, you are the only one with whom I can deal,\" said simple Abdul Karim. \"Here are eight krans. Use them in the service of God, and don't forget to pay me back a hundredfold.\"\n\nWrapping up the eight krans very carefully, the cunning beggar promised some day to return them a hundredfold.\n\nAt last Abdul Karim came in sight of his cottage, and little Yusuf, who had been all day on the look-out for him, ran breathlessly to meet him. \"Where's my horse and sword, father?\" he cried. And Fatima, who had just come up, called out, \"And my handkerchief and golden slippers?\" And Zeeba asked for her bit of silk.\n\nPoor Abdul Karim looked so confused, that his wife said: \"Be quiet, my dears. Your father could not bring them all with him, so he has packed them on Yusuf's horse and left him in charge of a servant, who will be here presently.\" But when she heard his story, and above all that he had given eight krans to a beggar, she got very angry, and marched off and told the master.\n\nBut the master was still more angry, and said: \"What! the blockhead gave his eight krans to a beggar? Send him to me.\" And when Abdul Karim came before him, he said scornfully: \"You must fancy yourself a big man, Abdul. I never give more than a copper coin to a beggar, but your Excellency gives them silver. The beggar promised that you should be repaid a hundredfold, did he? And it shall be so, even now.\" Then as Abdul's face brightened, he laughed and said: \"Not in money, but in stripes.\" And his servants threw Abdul on the ground and gave him one hundred blows on his bare feet.\n\nThe next day, Abdul's master sent for him again, and after calling him a fool, said: \"I have a nice little job for you, that will bring you to your proper senses. Go into the field and dig for water, day after day until you find it.\"\n\nSo for many days Abdul labored under the scorching sun, until he had dug down to a depth of about thirty feet, and then he came upon a brass vessel, finely chased, full of round white stones, which fairly dazzled his eyes in the fierce sunlight. He put one in his mouth and tried to break it with his teeth, but could not.\n\nThen he said to himself, \"The master has planted some rice and it has turned into stones. Perhaps there are some more.\" And going down a few feet lower, he found another pot filled with sparkling stones of various colors.\n\nThen he remembered that he had seen pretty pieces of glass like these for sale in Meshed, and made up his mind that on the first opportunity he would again visit the city and take the stones with him. Meanwhile, he would hide them, and say nothing.\n\nAbdul did not have to wait long for a holiday, for on finding water a little lower down, his master was so pleased that he gave him a well-deserved rest, and then Abdul set off for Meshed. But before entering the city, he hid most of the treasure at the foot of a tree under a big stone. Then with still a pocket full, he went straight to the shop where he had seen such stones, and spoke to the shopkeeper who was seated at the entrance to his shop, calmly smoking his water-pipe.\n\n\"Do you want to buy any more stones like those?\" he asked, pointing to some in a brass tray. \"Yes, have you got one?\" replied the merchant, for Abdul did not look like a man who was likely to have more than one, if any.\n\n\"I have a pocket full of them,\" said Abdul.\n\n\"You have a pocket full of pebbles, more likely,\" said the jeweler. But when Abdul took out a handful and showed him, he was so astonished that he could hardly speak. Trembling in every limb, he bade Abdul wait a minute, and leaving his apprentice in charge, he hastily left the shop. When he returned, the chief of the police was with him.\n\n\"I am innocent,\" cried the jeweler. \"There is the man. His pockets are filled with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls of great price. Without doubt he has found the long-lost treasure of Cyrus.\"\n\nThen Abdul was searched; the precious stones were found upon him; and when they had brought Zeeba and the children, the whole family were sent under a guard of five hundred soldiers to the capital.\n\nWhile all these things were taking place, the King saw in his dreams, for three nights, one after the other, the Holy Prophet, who, looking steadfastly at him, exclaimed: \"Abbas, protect and favor my friend.\" And on the third night, the King took courage and said to the Prophet: \"And who is thy friend?\" And the answer came:\n\n\"He is a poor laboring man, Abdul Karim by name, who of his poverty gave one-fifth to the shrine at Meshed, and now, because he has found the King's treasure, they have bound him, and are bringing him to this city to oppress him.\"\n\nSo the King went forth two days' journey to meet Abdul. First came one hundred horsemen. Next, poor Abdul, seated on a camel, with his arms bound tightly. Walking behind the camel were the weeping children and their mother. Then came the foot soldiers guarding the treasure. The King made the camel kneel down, and with his own hands undid the cruel bonds.\n\nThen with tears running down his face, Abdul knelt before the King and pleaded for his dear ones, saying: \"If thou slay me, at least let these innocent ones go free!\"\n\nLifting Abdul from the ground, the King then said: \"I am come to honor, not to slay thee. When thou hast rested, thou shalt return to thine own province, not as a prisoner, but as the Governor thereof.\" And smiling, he added:\n\n\"Already is the silk dress prepared for Zeeba; the horse and sword for Yusuf; and the Indian handkerchief and the golden slippers for Fatima have not been forgotten.\" For the King had read in the report of the chief of police all the details of Abdul's case.\n\nAnd so it was that Abdul's piety and gift to the shrine had come back, not a hundredfold, but beyond his wildest dreams, and the shrine and the poor benefited greatly thereby."

What to do with him the man did not know.\n\n\"Come,\" said the father one day, \"we will go out into the wide world. It may be that somewhere or other we will find a master who can make you work.\"\n\nThe lad was very good-natured. \"Very well,\" said he, \"I am willing\"; and he arose and stretched himself and yawned, and then he was ready to set out.\n\nThe father put on his cap and took a staff in his hand, and then he was ready, too.\n\nThe two of them journeyed along together, in step and out of step, and after a while they came to a deep wood.

And that is my name.\"\n\n\"I said, 'Oh, what have I done to have such a lazy son,'\" replied the man, \"but I did not call you, for I did not know that was your name.\"\n\nThe Green one looked closely at the lad. \"Is he so lazy?\" he asked. \"He looks a stout, healthy fellow.\"\n\n\"That is the worst of it,\" answered the father. \"He is so stout and healthy that he eats me out of house and home, and not one stroke will he do to pay for it. I have tried to apprentice him to different masters, but they soon weary of him and drive him out.\"\n\n\"Very well; I will take him as an apprentice myself,\" answered the little man. \"Leave him here with me for a year. Come back at the end of that time, and if you know him again and are able to choose him out from among my other apprentices, then you shall take him home with you, but if not, then he shall serve with me a year longer.\"\n\nVery well, the father was willing to agree to that. It would only be for a year, for of course he would recognize his own son anywhere. So he left the lad with Oh and went on home again.\n\nOh took the lad down into the country that lies beneath this earth, and the way was not long. There everything was green. Oh's house was made of green rushes. His wife was green and his daughters were green and his dog was green, and when they gave the lad food to eat, it was green also.\n\nThe oldest daughter would have been a beauty if she had not been green all over--eyes, hair, and all. As soon as she saw the lad she loved him and would have been glad to have him for a husband, but he had no fancy for her.\n\n\"When I marry,\" said he, \"it shall be some girl who is good red and white flesh and blood like myself.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Oh. \"After you have lived here for a while you will be glad enough to have her for a wife.\"\n\nThe lad lived down in the under country for a year, and Oh taught him much magic, and he was very useful to the old Green One.\n\nBut at the end of the year the father came back in search of his son. He stopped at the very same spot in the forest where he had stopped before and cried out in a loud voice, \"Oh! Oh! I would like to see my son.\"\n\nAt once Oh appeared before him. \"Come with me,\" he said, \"but remember our bargain. If you know your son when you see him he is yours again, but if you do not know him, then he must stay with me and serve me still another year.\"\n\nThe man was very willing to agree, for it would be a strange thing if he did not know his own son when he saw him.\n\nOh led him down the short way to the land that is under this, and when he got there the man stared about him in wonder. Never had he seen so many green things in all his life before.\n\nOh took a handful of corn and scattered it about, calling as he did so. Then a great number of cocks that were pecking about the place came running and began to pick up the corn.\n\n\"Tell me now, which of these is your son?\" asked Oh, \"for one of them is he.\"\n\nThe man stared and scratched his head and stared again, but he could not tell, for one cock was just like another. He had to own that he could not tell which was his son.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Oh. \"Then you will have to go home without him. Come back at the end of another year, and then if you know him from his mates you shall take him home with you, but if not then he shall stay with me a twelvemonth longer.\"\n\nThat did not suit the man at all, but he could not say no, for that was what the bargain had been.\n\nAt the end of the year the man came back to the forest again and called upon Oh, and Oh was quickly before him.\n\n\"Come along,\" said Oh. \"You surely ought to know your son when you see him. If you do he shall go home with you, and I shall not say no to it, but if not then he shall stay with me a year longer.\"\n\nWhen the man heard this he was troubled, for he feared the Green One meant to play some trick on him as he had before, and he wanted his son home again, lazy or not. Moreover the lad's mother was grieving for him.\n\nOh led the man down to the underworld and over to a field where a flock of rams was grazing.\n\n\"All these are my servants,\" said Oh, \"and one of them is your son. Look well and tell me which is he, for unless you can choose him out he must stay here with me.\"\n\nThe man looked and looked, but he could not tell which of the rams was his son, for they all looked alike to him, so he had to go home without him.\n\nWhen the lad's mother heard of this second trick the Green One had played on her husband she wept bitterly. \"If we cannot find some way to get round him, we will never have the lad back again,\" she said.\n\n\"That is true,\" said the man; \"but if our son looks like a cock, how can I tell him from other cocks; and if he looks like a ram, how can I tell him from other rams?\"\n\nWell, time slipped by, and the man and his wife grew poorer and poorer, for they were growing old, and they needed a young body in the house to work for them.\n\nWhen it was about time for the man to set out for Oh's house his wife said to him, \"See now! we have nothing left in the house but a small loaf and a bit of honeycomb. But we can do better than fill our stomach with them. Do you take them to the old Wise Woman who lives over beyond the hill. Tell her they are a gift, and then ask her what we can do to meet the tricks of the little old Green One.\"\n\nThe man did as his wife bade him, though he was hungry and would have been glad of a bit of the bread himself.\n\nThe Wise Woman was pleased with the gift, and thanked the man kindly. Then the man told her all his troubles and asked her how he was to get his son back again from Oh.\n\n\"Listen!\" said the old woman. \"Oh would gladly keep your son with him as a husband for his daughter, and if you do not bring the lad away with you this time, you will never have him back. This time Oh will show you a flock of doves, and one of them will be your son. Look closely at them, and the one that has tears in its eyes is he, for only a human soul can weep.\"\n\nThe father thanked the old woman and hurried back home again, and very soon after it was time to set out for Oh's house.\n\nThe man travelled along till he came to the wood and the place where he had come twice already, and he stood there and cried, \"Oh! Oh!\"\n\nThen Oh appeared before him. \"Here I am,\" said Oh, \"ready and waiting for you. This time, as before, I tell you that if you know your son when you see him you shall take him away with you, but if, this time, you do not know him, then he is mine forever.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the man, \"that is a bargain.\"\n\nThen Oh took him down to the underworld. He called to a flock of doves that was perched on the roof and scattered a handful of peas on the ground for them. The doves flew down all about them and began to peck up the peas; but one dove would not eat but sat mournfully on a low bough and looked at them, and its eyes were full of tears.\n\n\"This one is my son,\" cried the man, pointing to the dove that wept.\n\nAs soon as he said this the dove changed its shape and became a young man, and this was the son, though he had become so fine and tall and handsome in these three years that his father could scarcely recognize him.\n\nThen Oh was in a fine rage. He danced with fury and tore his beard.\n\n\"Very well,\" he cried, \"he is yours now, but you shall not keep him long, and when I once get him back again he is mine forever.\"\n\nBut the lad paid no heed to his threats. He and his father were soon on the upper earth again, and they set out for home, one foot before the other.\n\nOn the way the father told the lad how badly it had gone with him and the mother in the past years; of how poor they were, and of how their hut was tumbling to pieces, and how their cow had died.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said the lad. \"I learned quite a bit of magic from the Green One, and that should help us out now. Do you hear the huntsmen winding their horns farther on in the open?\"\n\nYes, the father heard them.\n\n\"I will turn myself into a greyhound,\" said the lad. \"The hunt is coming this way, and when the huntsmen see me they will want to buy me. Ask them three hundred dollars for me; no more, no less, but when they take me do not leave the leash on me, whatever you do. Take it off and put it in your pocket, and then all will be well with me. Fail to do this, and misfortune will surely overtake me.\"\n\nThe father promised to do as the son said, and then the lad turned himself into a greyhound, and he was so sleek and handsome that the man could not admire him enough; but about his neck was an old, worn leash that did not look as though it were worth a penny. It seemed a pity to leave it on the neck of such a handsome dog.\n\nThe man went on a little further and then he came to where a grand nobleman and his friends were hunting a hare. They had a pack of dogs with them but the hare had outrun them.\n\nWhen the nobleman saw the man and the greyhound he stopped his horse.\n\n\"That is a fine greyhound you have there.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" answered the man.\n\n\"Do you think it could course down the hare we are chasing?\"\n\nYes, the man was sure it could.\n\n\"Then let me have it and I will pay you a good price for it.\"\n\nVery well, he could have it for three hundred dollars, but that was without the leash; the leash was not for sale.\n\nThe nobleman laughed aloud, \"when the dog is mine,\" he said, \"he shall have a golden leash, for that one you have is fit for nothing but the ash heap.\"\n\nThe nobleman then paid the man three hundred dollars and unfastened the leash from the dog's neck.\n\nAway he flew like the wind and soon caught the hare. But when the hunters reached the spot where the hare lay they could see nothing of the dog. Only a tall and handsome youth stood there, and he was flushed and hot as though he had been running.\n\n\"Have you seen my greyhound, a sleek and handsome dog?\" asked the nobleman.\n\nNo, the youth had not seen any dog.\n\nThe nobleman called and whistled, and he and his huntsman hunted far and near, but they never found the greyhound.\n\nAs for the lad he set out on the road his father had taken and soon caught up with him.\n\n\"That was a very pretty trick,\" said the father; \"but after all three hundred dollars is not much. It will barely buy us a cow and clothes and put a new roof on the hut.\"\n\n\"Yes, but that is not the only trick I know,\" answered the son. \"Look at the hill over yonder and tell me what you see.\"\n\nThe father looked. \"I see a company of fine ladies and gentlemen,\" answered the father, \"and they are flying their falcons.\"\n\n\"I will change myself into a falcon, and when you have come to where they are you shall loose me, and I will strike down a quail. Then they will want to buy me. Sell me for three hundred dollars, no more, no less. But whatever you do take off my hood and keep it, or misfortune will surely overtake us.\"\n\nThe father promised he would do this, and then the lad turned himself into a falcon and perched upon his father's hand.\n\nPresently the father came up to where the ladies and gentlemen were at their sport. They loosed their falcons, and the falcons flew after the quail, but always they failed to strike, and the quail escaped.\n\n\"That is poor sport,\" said the man. \"I can show you better.\"\n\nHe took off the hood and cast his falcon at the quail, and it quickly struck down its prey.\n\nThe gentlemen and ladies were astonished at the quickness of the falcon and at the beauty of its feathers.\n\n\"Sell us the bird,\" they said.\n\nYes, the man was willing to do that, but his price was three hundred dollars without the hood; the hood was not for sale for love nor money.\n\nAll the fine folk began to laugh. \"What do we want with that old hood?\" they cried. \"We will give the bird a hood that is worthy of a king.\"\n\nSo the man took the three hundred dollars and the hood and went on his way.\n\nThe one who had bought the falcon cast it at a quail, and it struck down its prey as before, but when the hunters reached the place where the birds had fallen they saw no falcon, but only a handsome young man who stood there looking down at the dead quail.\n\n\"What became of the falcon that was here?\" they asked.\n\nBut the youth had seen no falcon.\n\nHe set out and soon overtook his father, who had not gone far. \"And now art thou content?\" he asked.\n\n\"Six hundred dollars is not a fortune,\" answered the man. \"Since you have done so well you might have done better.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" answered the son. \"We are now coming to a town where they are holding a fair. I will change myself into a horse, and you shall take me there and sell me for a thousand dollars,--no more, no less. But heed what I say. Do not sell the halter whatever you do, or evil will surely come of it.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the father. \"I will remember.\"\n\nThe son then changed himself into a coal-black horse. His skin was like satin, his eyes like jewels, and when he moved, his hoofs scarcely seemed to touch the ground. But around his neck was an old leather halter that was scarcely fit for an old farm nag.\n\nThe father led the horse on to where the fair was being held, and at once a crowd gathered around him, all bidding for the horse. Some offered him more and some less.\n\n\"The price is a thousand dollars,\" said the father, \"no more, no less. But that is without the halter.\"\n\nThen the people all laughed. \"Who wants the halter?\" they cried. \"What we offer is for the horse alone. The halter we would not take as a gift.\"\n\nThen a rough looking, black-haired gypsy elbowed his way through the crowd. He was really the Green One who had taken on this form, though this the man did not know.\n\n\"I will give you two thousand,\" he cried. \"One thousand for the horse and one thousand for the halter, but I will not have one without the other.\"\n\nWhen the crowd heard this they laughed louder than ever. They thought the gypsy was crazy to offer such a price.\n\nAs for the father he stood there gaping and he did not know what to do.\n\n\"The price of the horse is a thousand dollars,\" he said.\n\n\"And a thousand for the halter,\" said the gypsy.\n\nWell, two thousand dollars seemed a fortune to the man. Moreover he did not see what harm it could do to sell the halter too.\n\nSo he let the gypsy have the horse and the halter as well, and the gypsy paid him two thousand dollars and led the horse away.\n\nAnd now the lad could not change himself back into his human shape, because the halter held him, and this Oh knew very well.\n\nHe led the horse back to the forest and down to the world that is under this. \"Now I have you again,\" he said, \"and this time you shall not escape me.\"\n\nThen he called to his youngest daughter and bade her take the horse down to the river to drink.\n\nWhen she had brought the horse to the river bank it said to her. \"Loosen, I pray of thee, the halter, that I may drink more easily.\"\n\nThen the girl, who was a stupid wench, loosened the halter. At once the lad slipped out of it and changed himself into a perch and fled away down the river.\n\nBut the Green One knew what had happened. He rushed down to the river and changed himself into a pike and pursued after the perch.\n\nOn and on they went, but the pike swam faster than the perch and was just about to catch it when the perch sprang clear out of the water.\n\nThe daughter of the Tsar was walking by the river, and she was such a beauty that it made the heart ache to look at her. On her arm she carried a basket.\n\nAs the perch leaped he changed himself into a ruby ring and fell into the basket.\n\nThe damsel was very much astonished to see the ring in her basket. She did not know where it had come from. She looked up, and she looked down, but she could see no one who could have thrown the ring.\n\nThen she took it up and slid it upon her finger, and at once she loved it as she had never loved anything in all her life before.\n\nShe carried it to her father and said to him, \"Look what a pretty ring I have found!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered her father, \"but where did you find it?\"\n\n\"I found it in my basket, but how it came there I do not know.\"\n\nThe Tsaritsa's mother also admired the ring very much. Never had they seen such a brilliant and flashing ruby before.\n\nNow at first, after the perch leaped out of the river and into the Tsaritsa's basket, Oh did not know what had become of him. He was obliged to go home and get out his magic books, and then he soon learned where the lad was.\n\nHe then changed himself into a venerable merchant, clothed in velvet robes and with a long white beard. He broke a stick from an ash tree and changed it into a horse, and mounted on it and rode away to the Tsar's palace.\n\nThen he asked to speak with the Tsar, and so old and venerable did he look that they would not refuse him, but brought him before the Tsar.\n\n\"What dost thou want, old man?\" asked the Tsar.\n\n\"Your majesty,\" answered the Green One, \"I have had a great loss. I was crossing the river in a boat, and I had with me a very handsome ruby ring that I was carrying with me to my master, who is also a Tsar. Unfortunately I lost the ring overboard, and I thought it might perchance have washed up on the shore and have been picked up by one of thy servants.\"\n\n\"What was thy ring like?\" asked the Tsar.\n\nThen the pretended merchant described the Tsaritsa's ring exactly.\n\nThe Tsar sent for his daughter, and she came with the ring on her finger, for she would not take it off, either night or day.\n\n\"Let me see thy ring,\" said the Tsar.\n\nHe took her hand in his and examined the ring carefully, and it was in every respect exactly as the Green One had described it.\n\n\"Is this thy ring?\" the Tsar asked of the merchant.\n\n\"Yes, your majesty, it is.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Tsar to his daughter, \"it is right that thou shouldst return it to him.\"\n\nThe Tsaritsa wept and implored. She offered the merchant her pearls and every other gem she had if he would but let her keep the ring, but he refused.\n\n\"Very well, then, it shall be neither thine nor mine,\" cried the Tsaritsa, and she drew the ring from her finger and dashed it against the wall.\n\nAt once the ring changed into a hundred millet seeds and was scattered all over the floor.\n\nBut the Green One as quickly changed himself into a cock and ran about this way and that, pecking up the millet seeds and swallowing them. Ninety-nine millet seeds he found and ate, but the hundredth he did not find, because it had fallen beside the Tsaritsa's foot, and the hem of her robe covered it.\n\nAs soon as the cock had swallowed the ninety-ninth seed he sprang upon the window sill, and stretched his neck and crowed with triumph.\n\nBut the hundredth seed was really the lad, and in that moment he changed himself back into his human form, and before the cock knew what had happened, he caught hold of it and wrung its neck and that was the end of Oh and his magic.\n\nAs for the Tsaritsa, no sooner had she seen the lad than her heart went out to him, and she loved him even better than she had her ring, and she declared that he and he only should be her husband.\n\nThe Tsar did not know what to say to that, for it did not seem fitting that his daughter should marry a common man. But the Tsaritsa begged and plead with him till he could no longer withstand her.\n\nSo she and the lad were married with great pomp and magnificence.\n\nHis old father and mother were bidden to the wedding, and they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw their son stand there in those costly robes with a crown upon his head and the Tsaritsa beside him as his bride.\n\nThe old people were given a house to live in and plenty of money to spend, and they all lived in peace and happiness forever after."

      "body": "Little Thumb:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a fagot-maker and his wife, who had seven children, all boys. The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest only seven.\n\nThey were very poor, and their seven children were a great source of trouble to them because not one of them was able to earn his bread. What gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was very delicate, and scarce ever spoke a word, which made people take for stupidity that which was a sign of good sense. He was very little, and when born he was no bigger than one's thumb; hence he was called Little Thumb.\n\nThe poor child was the drudge of the household, and was always in the wrong. He was, however, the most bright and discreet of all the brothers; and if he spoke little, he heard and thought the more.\n\nThere came a very bad year, and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children. One evening, when they were in bed, and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief:\n\n\"You see plainly that we no longer can give our children food, and I cannot bear to see them die of hunger before my eyes; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow, which may very easily be done, for, while they amuse themselves in tying up fagots, we have only to run away and leave them without their seeing us.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried out his wife, \"could you really take the children and lose them?\"\n\nIn vain did her husband represent to her their great poverty; she would not consent to it. She was poor, but she was their mother.\n\nHowever, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them die of hunger, she consented, and went weeping to bed.\n\nLittle Thumb heard all they had said; for, hearing that they were talking business, he got up softly and slipped under his father's seat, so as to hear without being seen. He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking of what he had to do. He got up early in the morning, and went to the brookside, where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returned home. They all went out, but Little Thumb never told his brothers a word of what he knew.\n\nThey went into a very thick forest, where they could not see one another at ten paces apart. The fagot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up sticks to make fagots. Their father and mother, seeing them busy at their work, got away from them unbeknown and then all at once ran as fast as they could through a winding by-path.\n\nWhen the children found they were alone, they began to cry with all their might. Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get home again; for, as he came, he had dropped the little white pebbles he had in his pockets all along the way. Then he said to them, \"Do not be afraid, my brothers,—father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again; only follow me.\"\n\nThey followed, and he brought them home by the very same way they had come into the forest. They dared not go in at first, but stood outside the door to listen to what their father and mother were saying.\n\nThe very moment the fagot-maker and his wife reached home the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had long owed them, and which they never hoped to see. This gave them new life, for the poor people were dying of hunger. The fagot-maker sent his wife to the butcher's at once. As it was a long while since they had eaten, she bought thrice as much meat as was needed for supper for two people. When they had eaten, the woman said:—\n\n\"Alas! where are our poor children now? They would make a good feast of what we have left here; it was you, William, who wished to lose them. I told you we should repent of it. What are they now doing in the forest? Alas! perhaps the wolves have already eaten them up; you are very inhuman thus to have lost your children.\"\n\nThe fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated twenty times that he would repent of it, and that she was in the right. He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue. The fagot-maker was, perhaps, more sorry than his wife, but she teased him so he could not endure it. She wept bitterly, saying:—\n\n\"Alas! where are my children now, my poor children?\"\n\nShe said this once so very loud that the children, who were at the door, heard her and cried out all together:—\n\n\"Here we are! Here we are!\"\n\nShe ran immediately to let them in, and said as she embraced them:—\n\n\"How happy I am to see you again, my dear children; you are very tired and very hungry, and, my poor Peter, you are covered with mud. Come in and let me clean you.\"\n\nPeter was her eldest son, whom she loved more than all the rest, because he was red haired, as she was herself.\n\nThey sat down to table, and ate with an appetite which pleased both father and mother, to whom they told how frightened they were in the forest, nearly all speaking at once. The good folk were delighted to see their children once more, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted. But when the money was all spent, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and resolved to lose their children again. And, that they might be the surer of doing it, they determined to take them much farther than before.\n\nThey could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by Little Thumb, who laid his plans to get out of the difficulty as he had done before; but, though he got up very early to go and pick up some little pebbles, he could not, for he found the house-door double-locked. He did not know what to do. Their father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast. He reflected that he might make use of the bread instead of the pebbles, by throwing crumbs all along the way they should pass, and so he stuffed it in his pocket. Their father and mother led them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest, and then, stealing away into a by-path, left them there. Little Thumb was not very much worried about it, for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered all along as he came; but he was very much surprised when he could not find a single crumb: the birds had come and eaten them all.\n\nThey were now in great trouble; for the more they wandered, the deeper they went into the forest. Night now fell, and there arose a high wind, which filled them with fear. They fancied they heard on every side the howling of wolves coming to devour them. They scarce dared to speak or turn their heads. Then it rained very hard, which wetted them to the skin. Their feet slipped at every step, and they fell into the mud, covering their hands with it so that they knew not what to do with them.\n\nLittle Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover anything. Looking on every side, he saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long way beyond the forest. He came down, and, when upon the ground, he could see it no more, which grieved him sadly. However, having walked for some time with his brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light, he discovered it again as he came out of the wood.\n\nThey arrived at last at the house where this candle was, not without many frights; for very often they lost sight of it, which happened every time they came into a hollow. They knocked at the door, and a good woman came and opened it.\n\nShe asked them what they wanted. Little Thumb told her they were poor children who were lost in the forest, and desired to lodge there for charity's sake. The woman, seeing them all so very pretty, began to weep and said to them: \"Alas! poor babies, where do you come from? Do you know that this house belongs to a cruel Ogre who eats little children?\"\n\n\"Alas! dear madam,\" answered Little Thumb (who, with his brothers, was trembling in every limb), \"what shall we do? The wolves of the forest surely will devour us to-night if you refuse us shelter in your house; and so we would rather the gentleman should eat us. Perhaps he may take pity upon us if you will be pleased to ask him to do so.\"\n\nThe Ogre's wife, who believed she could hide them from her husband till morning, let them come in, and took them to warm themselves at a very good fire; for there was a whole sheep roasting for the Ogre's supper.\n\nAs they began to warm themselves they heard three or four great raps at the door; this was the Ogre, who was come home. His wife quickly hid them under the bed and went to open the door. The Ogre at once asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat himself down to table. The sheep was as yet all raw, but he liked it the better for that. He sniffed about to the right and left, saying:\n\n\"I smell fresh meat.\"\n\n\"What you smell,\" said his wife, \"must be the calf which I have just now killed and flayed.\"\n\n\"I smell fresh meat, I tell you once more,\" replied the Ogre, looking crossly at his wife, \"and there is something here which I do not understand.\"\n\nAs he spoke these words he got up from the table and went straight to the bed.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"that is how you would cheat me; I know not why I do not eat you, too; it is well for you that you are tough. Here is game, which comes very luckily to entertain three Ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a visit in a day or two.\"\n\nHe dragged them out from under the bed, one by one. The poor children fell upon their knees and begged his pardon, but they had to do with one of the most cruel of Ogres, who, far from having any pity on them, was already devouring them in his mind, and told his wife they would be delicate eating when she had made a good sauce.\n\nHe then took a great knife, and, coming up to these poor children, sharpened it upon a great whetstone which he held in his left hand. He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him:\n\n\"What need you do it now? Will you not have time enough to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Hold your prating,\" said the Ogre; \"they will eat the tenderer.\"\n\n\"But you have so much meat already,\" replied his wife; \"here are a calf, two sheep, and half a pig.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the Ogre; \"give them a good supper that they may not grow thin, and put them to bed.\"\n\nThe good woman was overjoyed at this, and gave them a good supper; but they were so much afraid that they could not eat. As for the Ogre, he sat down again to drink, being highly pleased that he had the wherewithal to treat his friends. He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary, which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed.\n\nThe Ogre had seven daughters, who were still little children. These young Ogresses had all of them very fine complexions; but they all had little gray eyes, quite round, hooked noses, a very large mouth, and very long, sharp teeth, set far apart. They were not as yet wicked, but they promised well to be, for they had already bitten little children.\n\nThey had been put to bed early, all seven in one bed, with every one a crown of gold upon her head. There was in the same chamber a bed of the like size, and the Ogre's wife put the seven little boys into this bed, after which she went to bed herself.\n\nLittle Thumb, who had observed that the Ogre's daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his not killing them that evening, got up about midnight, and, taking his brothers' bonnets and his own, went very softly and put them upon the heads of the seven little Ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold, which he put upon his own head and his brothers', so that the Ogre might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill.\n\nThings turned out just as he had thought; for the Ogre, waking about midnight, regretted that he had deferred till morning to do that which he might have done overnight, and jumped quickly out of bed, taking his great knife.\n\n\"Let us see,\" said he, \"how our little rogues do, and not make two jobs of the matter.\"\n\nHe then went up, groping all the way, into his daughters' chamber; and, coming to the bed where the little boys lay, and who were all fast asleep, except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when he found the Ogre fumbling about his head, as he had done about his brothers', he felt the golden crowns, and said:—\n\n\"I should have made a fine piece of work of it, truly; it is clear I drank too much last night.\"\n\nThen he went to the bed where the girls lay, and, having found the boys' little bonnets:—\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"my merry lads, are you there? Let us work boldly.\"\n\nAnd saying these words, without more ado, he cruelly murdered all his seven daughters. Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again.\n\nSo soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and bade them put on their clothes quickly and follow him. They stole softly into the garden and got over the wall. They ran about, all night, trembling all the while, without knowing which way they went.\n\nThe Ogre, when he woke, said to his wife: \"Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night.\" The Ogress was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after what manner she should dress them; but, thinking that he had ordered her to go up and put on their clothes, she went, and was horrified when she perceived her seven daughters all dead.\n\nShe began by fainting away, as was only natural in such a case. The Ogre, fearing his wife was too long in doing what he had ordered, went up himself to help her. He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle.\n\n\"Ah! what have I done?\" cried he. \"The wretches shall pay for it, and that instantly.\"\n\nHe threw a pitcher of water upon his wife's face, and having brought her to herself, \"Give me quickly,\" cried he, \"my seven-leagued boots, that I may go and catch them.\"\n\nHe went out into the country, and, after running in all directions, he came at last into the very road where the poor children were, and not above a hundred paces from their father's house. They espied the Ogre, who went at one step from mountain to mountain, and over rivers as easily as the narrowest brooks. Little Thumb, seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were, hid his brothers in it, and crowded into it himself, watching always what would become of the Ogre.\n\nThe Ogre, who found himself tired with his long and fruitless journey (for these boots of seven leagues greatly taxed the wearer), had a great mind to rest himself, and, by chance, went to sit down upon the rock in which the little boys had hidden themselves. As he was worn out with fatigue, he fell asleep, and, after reposing himself some time, began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was going to take their lives. Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers, and told them that they should run away at once toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they need not be in any trouble about him. They took his advice, and got home quickly.\n\nLittle Thumb then went close to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently, and put them on his own legs. The boots were very long and large, but as they were fairy boots, they had the gift of becoming big or little, according to the legs of those who wore them; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made for him. He went straight to the Ogre's house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of her murdered daughters.\n\n\"Your husband,\" said Little Thumb, \"is in very great danger, for he has been taken by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver. At the very moment they held their daggers at his throat he perceived me and begged me to come and tell you the condition he was in, and to say that you should give me all he has of value, without retaining any one thing; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy. As his case is very pressing, he desired me to make use of his seven-leagued boots, which you see I have on, so that I might make the more haste and that I might show you that I do not impose upon you.\"\n\nThe good woman, being greatly frightened, gave him all she had; for this Ogre was a very good husband, though he ate up little children. Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre's money, came home to his father's house, where he was received with abundance of joy.\n\nThere are many people who do not agree in regard to this act of Little Thumb's, and pretend that he never robbed the Ogre at all, and that he only thought he might very justly take off his seven-leagued boots because he made no other use of them but to run after little children. These folks affirm that they are very well assured of this, because they have drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker's house. They declare that when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre's boots he went to Court, where he was informed that they were very much in trouble about a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off, and anxious as to the success of a battle. He went, they say, to the King and told him that if he desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night.\n\nThe King promised him a great sum of money if he succeeded. Little Thumb returned that very same night with the news; and, this first expedition causing him to be known, he earned as much as he wished, for the King paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army. Many ladies employed him also to carry messages, from which he made much money. After having for some time carried on the business of a messenger and gained thereby great wealth, he went home to his father, and it is impossible to express the joy of his family. He placed them all in comfortable circumstances, bought places for his father and brothers, and by that means settled them very handsomely in the world, while he successfully continued to make his own way."

      "body": "King Grisly-beard:\n\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she only made sport of them.\n\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank —kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’ said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\n\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.\n\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, ‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to go—you must not stay here—you must travel on with your husband.’\n\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’\n\nThen they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she. ‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’\n\nAt last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she; ‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said, ‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’ sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’\n\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.’\n\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat that was left, and on this they lived.\n\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich meats, which she put into her basket to take home.\n\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is time to hold our marriage feast.’\n\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party."

      "body": "The Brahmin And The Diamonds:\n\nOnce a Brahmin was passing through a jungle to reach another town, when a huge and cruel giant hiding somewhere behind the thick bushes, attacked the Brahmin and jumped upon his shoulders. The giant dangled both his legs in front of the Brahmin and sat comfortably on his shoulders.\n\nThe Brahmin began trembling with fear, but he was helpless. He didn't know what to do. The giant said to the Brahmin, \"I'm very fond of human flesh. But before killing and eating you I wish to have a joy ride on your shoulders. So take me where I say.\"\n\nThe Brahmin had no choice, but to obey the giant. So he kept on walking. While walking the Brahmin noticed that the giant's feet were extraordinarily small and soft. The Brahmin asked the giant, \"I'm very surprised to see that you're so huge, but your feet are so small and delicate. How is it?\"\n\nThe giant thought, there was no harm in revealing the secret of his feet to Brahmin since very soon the Brahmin is going to be killed and eaten up by him. So he said, \"I never walk on ground with my feet wet. Walking or running on wet feet gives me great pain.\"\n\nThe Brahmin kept the giants words firmly in his mind and kept on walking. After walking quite a distance they reached on the banks of a river. The giant said to the Brahmin, \"Let me down here and you yourself stay here, till I come back, after taking my bath.\"\n\nThe Brahmin became very happy seeing the giant taking a dive in the river. By the time the giant took another dive in the water, the Brahmin took to his heels and ran away to save his life.\n\nThe giant saw the Brahmin running away from the river bank, but he could do nothing to stop him. He was wet all over because he was taking his bath. In this situation, with his feet wet the giant was quite helpless to chase the Brahmin. Thus, the Brahmin escaped from the clutches of the giant and saved his life.\n\nMoral: To sacrifice ones life for others is a great deed."

      "body": "The Hunter And The Doves:\n\nThere was a huge banyan tree standing on the outer boundaries of a village. All kinds of birds had their homes in this tree. Even the travellers would come and relax under its cool shade during the hot summer days.\n\nOnce, a fowler came to take a rest there. He also had a huge net with him. He set his net under the tree and strewed some grains of rice to lure the birds. A crow living in the tree saw it and cautioned his friends not to go down to eat the rice.\n\nBut at the same moment, a flock of doves came flying over the banyan tree. They saw grains of rice strewn around and without losing a moment, descended on the ground to eat the grains of rice. As soon as they started eating the rice, a huge net fell over them and they were all trapped. They tried everything to come out of the net, but in vain. They saw the fowler coming towards them. He was very happy to find a large number of doves trapped inside the net.\n\nHowever, the king of doves was very intelligent and clever. He said to other doves, \"We must do something immediately to free ourselves from the clutches of this fowler. I've an idea. We should all fly up together clutching the net in our beaks. We will decide our next course of action later. Now, come on friends, let's fly.\"\n\nSo each dove picked up a part of the huge net in his beak and they all flew up together. Seeing the birds flying along with the whole net, the fowler was surprised. He could never imagine this. He ran after the flying birds, shouting madly, but could not catch them. Soon the birds flew out of his sight.\n\nWhen the king dove saw that the fowler had given up the chase, he said to his friends, \"Now we all have to get out of this net. There lives a mouse on the nearby hillock. He is my friend. Let's go to him for his help.\"\n\nAll the doves flew on to meet the mouse. When the mouse heard the doves making noise in front of his hole, he got frightened and hid himself deeper into the hole. He came out only when he heard the king dove saying, \"Friend, it's 1, the king dove. We're in great difficulty. Please come out and help us.\"\n\nHearing the dove, his friend's voice, the mouse came out of his hole and saw the king dove and his friends trapped in the net.\n\n\"Oh!\", said the mouse, \"Who's done all this to you?\"\n\nThe king dove narrated the whole story. The mouse immediately started nibbling at the net around the king dove. The king dove said, \"No, my friend. First set my followers free. A king cannot keep his subjects in pain and enjoy the freedom for himself.\"\n\nThe mouse praised the king dove for his nobleness and nibbled at the portion of the net, which would set free the other doves first. And only at last, he freed the king dove.\n\nAll the doves were very grateful to the mouse. They thanked the mouse and then flew to their destination happily.\n\nMoral: Unity is strength."

      "body": "The Three Sillies:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a farmer and his wife who had one daughter, and she was courted by a gentleman. Every evening he used to come and see her, and stop to supper at the farmhouse, and the daughter used to be sent down into the cellar to draw the beer for supper.\n\nSo one evening she had gone down to draw the beer, and she happened to look up at the ceiling while she was drawing, and she saw a mallet stuck in one of the beams. It must have been there a long, long time, but somehow or other she had never noticed it before, and she began a- thinking.\n\nAnd she thought it was very dangerous to have that mallet there, for she said to herself: \"Suppose him and me was to be married, and we was to have a son, and he was to grow up to be a man, and come down into the cellar to draw the beer, like as I'm doing now, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!\" And she put down the candle and the jug, and sat herself down and began a-crying.\n\nWell, they began to wonder upstairs how it was that she was so long drawing the beer, and her mother went down to see after her, and she found her sitting on the settle crying, and the beer running over the floor. \"Why, whatever is the matter?\" said her mother. \"Oh, mother!\" says she, \"look at that horrid mallet! Suppose we was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down to the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!\" \"Dear, dear! what a dreadful thing it would be!\" said the mother, and she sat her down aside of the daughter and started a-crying too. \n\nThen after a bit the father began to wonder that they didn't come back, and he went down into the cellar to look after them himself, and there they two sat a- crying, and the beer running all over the floor. \"Whatever is the matter?\" says he. \"Why,\" says the mother, \"look at that horrid mallet. Just suppose, if our daughter and her sweetheart was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him, what a dreadful thing it would be!\" \"Dear, dear, dear! so it would!\" said the father, and he sat himself down aside of the other two, and started a-crying.\n\nNow the gentleman got tired of stopping up in the kitchen by himself, and at last he went down into the cellar too, to see what they were after; and there they three sat a-crying side by side, and the beer running all over the floor. And he ran straight and turned the tap. Then he said: \"Whatever are you three doing, sitting there crying, and letting the beer run all over the floor?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" says the father, \"look at that horrid mallet! Suppose you and our daughter was to be married, and was to have a son, and he was to grow up, and was to come down into the cellar to draw the beer, and the mallet was to fall on his head and kill him!\" And then they all started a-crying worse than before. But the gentleman burst out a- laughing, and reached up and pulled out the mallet, and then he said: \"I've travelled many miles, and I never met three such big sillies as you three before; and now I shall start out on my travels again, and when I can find three bigger sillies than you three, then I'll come back and marry your daughter.\" So he wished them good-bye, and started off on his travels, and left them all crying because the girl had lost her sweetheart.\n\nWell, he set out, and he travelled a long way, and at last he came to a woman's cottage that had some grass growing on the roof. And the woman was trying to get her cow to go up a ladder to the grass, and the poor thing durst not go. So the gentleman asked the woman what she was doing. \"Why, lookye,\" she said, \"look at all that beautiful grass. I'm going to get the cow on to the roof to eat it. She'll be quite safe, for I shall tie a string round her neck, and pass it down the chimney, and tie it to my wrist as I go about the house, so she can't fall off without my knowing it.\"\n\n \"Oh, you poor silly!\" said the gentleman, \"you should cut the grass and throw it down to the cow!\" But the woman thought it was easier to get the cow up the ladder than to get the grass down, so she pushed her and coaxed her and got her up, and tied a string round her neck, and passed it down the chimney, and fastened it to her own wrist. And the gentleman went on his way, but he hadn't gone far when the cow tumbled off the roof, and hung by the string tied round her neck, and it strangled her. And the weight of the cow tied to her wrist pulled the woman up the chimney, and she stuck fast half-way and was smothered in the soot.\n\nWell, that was one big silly.\n\nAnd the gentleman went on and on, and he went to an inn to stop the night, and they were so full at the inn that they had to put him in a double-bedded room, and another traveller was to sleep in the other bed. The other man was a very pleasant fellow, and they got very friendly together; but in the morning, when they were both getting up, the gentleman was surprised to see the other hang his trousers on the knobs of the chest of drawers and run across the room and try to jump into them, and he tried over and over again, and couldn't manage it; and the gentleman wondered whatever he was doing it for. At last he stopped and wiped his face with his handkerchief. \n\n\"Oh dear,\" he says, \"I do think trousers are the most awkwardest kind of clothes that ever were. I can't think who could have invented such things. It takes me the best part of an hour to get into mine every morning, and I get so hot! How do you manage yours?\" So the gentleman burst out a-laughing, and showed him how to put them on; and he was very much obliged to him, and said he never should have thought of doing it that way.\n\nSo that was another big silly.\n\nThen the gentleman went on his travels again; and he came to a village, and outside the village there was a pond, and round the pond was a crowd of people. And they had got rakes, and brooms, and pitchforks, reaching into the pond; and the gentleman asked what was the matter. \"Why,\" they say, \"matter enough! Moon's tumbled into the pond, and we can't rake her out anyhow!\" So the gentleman burst out a- laughing, and told them to look up into the sky, and that it was only the shadow in the water. But they wouldn't listen to him, and abused him shamefully, and he got away as quick as he could.\n\nSo there was a whole lot of sillies bigger than them three sillies at home. So the gentleman turned back home again and married the farmer's daughter, and if they didn't live happy for ever after, that's nothing to do with you or me."

      "body": "A Story:\n\nAll the apple trees in the garden were blooming. They had hastened to cover themselves with blossoms before their green leaves were fully unfolded. All the ducklings were in the farmyard, and so was the cat; it basked in the sun and tried to lick the sunshine from its own paws.\n\nAnd to look across the fields was a pleasing sight; there stood the corn, so beautifully green, while all the small birds chirped and twittered as happily as if they were having a great holiday.\n\nAnd, indeed, people could rightly think of this as a holiday, for it was Sunday. The bells were chiming while people in their best clothes were walking to church and looking so cheerful. It was such a bright, warm day that one might well say: \"How good God is to grant us so many blessings!\"\n\nBut inside the church the preacher in the pulpit spoke in a loud and angry tone; he said that all humans were wicked and that God would certainly punish them by sending them to the eternal torments of hell when they died. He said that they would never find peace or rest in hell, for their consciences would never die nor would the fires ever be extinguished.\n\nThis was terrible to hear, but still he went on as if the subject he was explaining were really true. He described hell to them as a stagnant cave, where all the impure and sinful of the world would be; there would be no air, only the hot sulphur flames, and no bottom there, and the wicked would sink deeper and deeper into eternal silence forever!\n\nIt was horrible to hear this, but the preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.\n\nBut the birds outside the church sang joyously, and the sun was shining warmly; it was as if each little bird were saying, \"Nothing is so great as the loving-kindness of the Almighty!\"\n\nYes, outside the church, it was not at all like the preacher's sermon.\n\nBefore the preacher went to bed that evening he noticed that his wife sat silent and thoughtful. \"What's the matter with you?\" he said to her.\n\n\"Why,\" she replied, \"the matter with me is that I can't quite bring myself to agree with what you said today in your sermon. It doesn't seem right to say that so many sinners will be condemned to everlasting fire forever. Forever! Ah, how long! I'm only a poor sinful creature myself, but I can't believe in my heart that even the vilest sinner will be condemned to burn in torment forever! We know the mercy of the Almighty is as great as His power; He knows how people are tempted from without and within by their own evil natures. No, I do not believe it, even if you said so.\"\n\nIt was autumn, the trees scattering their leaves on the ground, and the severe but earnest preacher sat beside the bed of a dying person. A faithful soul closed her eyes forever; it was the preacher's wife.\n\n\"If anyone can find peace and rest in the grave, through God's mercy, it is you!\" sighed the preacher, as he folded her hands and read a psalm over the dead woman.\n\nShe was laid in her grave. Two large tears rolled down the cheeks of the sincere man, and in the parsonage everything seemed so empty and still. The sunshine of his home had vanished, for she had gone.\n\nIt was night, and a cold wind blew over the head of the preacher. He opened his eyes and it seemed to him that the moon was shining into the room, but there was no moonlight. A figure stood beside his bed, and the spirit of his deceased wife shone upon him. Earnestly and sadly she looked at him, as if she had something on her mind that she wanted to say to him.\n\nHe half raised himself in bed, stretched out his arms to her, and cried, \"Then even you aren't permitted to rest in peace forever? Must you suffer, too? You, the best, the most pious!\"\n\nThe dead bowed her head as if to say \"yes,\" and laid her hand on her heart.\n\n\"And can I give you peace in the grave?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the distinct reply.\n\n\"And how?\"\n\n\"Bring me a hair, just one single hair, from the head of just one sinner whom God will condemn to eternal torture in hell.\"\n\n\"Yes, you should be freed that easily, you pure, you pious woman!\" he said.\n\n\"Then follow me,\" said the dead. It has been granted us that you can fly through the air by my side, wherever your thoughts are directed. To mortals we shall be invisible, and able to pass unseen through the closed and bolted doors of inner rooms. But you must be certainthat the man you point out to me as eternally damned is really one whom God will condemn to the torments of hell-fire forever, and he must be found before the cock crows.\"\n\nAnd quickly, as if carried by the wings of thoughts, they arrived at the great city. On the walls of the houses letters of living flame gave the names of the deadly sins: Arrogance, Greed, Drunkenness, Wantonness-in fact, the whole seven-colored bow of sin.\n\n\"Yes, in these houses, as I thought, as I knew,\" said the preacher, \"live those who will be punished forever.\"\n\nAnd then they stood before a brilliantly lighted gate. The broad steps were covered with flowers and carpets, while from the festive rooms came the sounds of music and dancing.\n\nA footman dressed in velvet and silk, with a large silverhandled stick in his hand, stood erect near the door.\n\n\"Our ball is as splendid as those at the palace of the king,\" said he, and turned toward the people outside. From tip to toe his thoughts were evident: \"Poor beggars who stare in at the gate; compared to me, you people are only cattle!\"\n\n\"Arrogance,\" said the dead wife. \"Do you see him?\"\n\n\"Him!\" replied the preacher. \"Yes, but this man is only a fool and a simpleton. He'll not be condemned to everlasting fire or eternal torment.\"\n\n\"Only a fool!\" echoed through the whole house of Arrogance; they were all fools there.\n\nThen they flew within the four bare walls of a miser's room-where, skinny, shivering with cold, hungry and thirsty, an old, old man clung desperately with all his thoughts to his gold. They saw how he, as in a fever, sprang from his miserable bed and took a loose stone out of the wall. There lay a stocking crammed full of gold pieces. The man kept fumbling in his ragged pockets, where he had sewn more gold, and his clammy fingers trembled.\n\n\"He is ill; it is insanity, a dreadful insanity. Haunted by terrors and evil dreams!\"\n\nSwiftly they left the miser's room, and stood before a dormitory of a jail, where the prisoners slept close together in long rows. Suddenly one of them started up in his sleep and uttered the terrible cry of a wild beast! With his pointed elbow, he gave his companion a ferocious blow, and the latter turned around sleepily: \"Shut up, you beast, and go to sleep! You go on like this every night!\"\n\n\"Every night!\" the man repeated. \"Yes, every night hehowls and torments me like this. I have committed many wrongs because of the passionate temper with which I was born. Twice my wicked temper has brought me here, but if I have done wrong, I am certainly being punished for it.\n\n\"There is only one thing I have not confessed. The last time I went out from here and passed by my master's farm, evil thoughts rose within me. I struck a match against the wall; it came a bit too close to the thatched roof. The heat seized onto the straw, as it often seizes onto me, and everything was burned. I helped to rescue the house property and the animals; no living creature perished, except a flock of pigeons which flew right into the fire, and also the yard dog, which was chained up. I had not thought of him. One could hear him howl, and that howl I can still hear when I want to sleep, and when I do fall asleep, the dog comes also. He is very large, with thick, shaggy fur, and he lies on me and howls and squeezes me until I am nearly choked. Now listen to what I tell you! You all can sleep and snore the whole night, but I can sleep for only a short quarter of an hour.\" And the blood rose to the head of the tormented; he threw himself upon his comrade and struck him in the face with his clenched fist.\n\n\"The madman is raging again!\" everyone cried. Then the other criminals threw themselves on him, wrestled with him, bent his body down until his head was forced between his legs, and then bound him so tightly that the blood seemed about to burst from his eyes and his pores.\n\n\"You're killing him!\" cried the preacher, and stretched his protecting hand over the sinner who had already suffered severely.\n\nThen the scene changed. Unseen they glided through rich homes, as well as through the huts of the poor. Wantonness and envy, and all the deadly sins, passed before them.\n\nAn angel from the judgment seat appeared, to read to each of them their sins and their excuses. These excuses meant little to God, for He reads the hearts; He knows every hidden sin that dwells there; He knows the temptations that are before us in the outer world as well as in our own hearts, and knows when to show mercy and pitying love.\n\nThe preacher's hand trembled, and now he dared not stretch it out to pluck a single hair from the head of any sinner. Tears streamed from his eyes as he thought of the fountain of mercy and love, which can quench even the everlasting fire of hell.\n\nAnd then the cock crowed!\n\n\"All-merciful God, I pray Thee grant her that peace in the grave which I have not been able to produce for her!\"\n\n\"I have it now,\" said the dead wife. \"It was your hard words and your gloomy belief in God and His creatures that drove me to you. Learn to know mankind. Even the soul of the wicked is a part of God Himself, a part that will conquer and extinguish even hell-fire forever.\"\n\nThe preacher felt a kiss upon his lips, and a light streamed about him. God's bright sunshine shone into the room, and his living wife stood beside him, tender and loving. She had awakened him from a dream sent him by God."

      "body": "The Wicked Prince:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a proud and wicked prince who thought only about how he might conquer all the nations of the earth and make his name a terror to all mankind. He plunged forth with fire and sword; his soldiers trampled down the grain in the fields, and put the torch to the peasant's cottage so that the red flames licked the very leaves from the trees, and the fruit hung roasted from black and charred limbs. Many a poor mother caught up her naked baby and tried to hide behind the smoking walls, but the soldiers followed her, and if they found her and the child, then began their devilish pleasure. Evil spirits could do no worse, but the Prince rejoiced in it all.\n\nDay by day his power increased; his name was feared by all, and fortune followed him in all his deeds. From the conquered cities he carried away gold and precious treasures, until he had amassed in his capital riches such as were unequaled in any other place. Then he built superb palaces and temples and arches, and whoever saw his magnificence said, \"What a great Prince!\" Never did they think of the misery he had brought upon other lands; never did they listen to the groans and lamentations from cities laid waste by fire.\n\nThe Prince gazed upon his gold, looked at his superb buildings, and thought like the crowd, \"What a great Prince!\" \"But I must have more, much more! There is no power that can equal-much less surpass-mine!\" And so he warred with his neighbors until all were defeated. The conquered kings were chained to his chariot with chains of gold when he drove through the streets; and when he sat at table they lay at the feet of the Prince and his courtiers, eating such scraps as might be thrown to them.\n\nNow the Prince had his own statue set up in the market places and the palaces; yes, he would even have set it in the churches, on the altars, but to this the priests said, \"Prince, you are great, but God is greater! We dare not obey your orders!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the evil Prince, \"then I shall conquer God too!\" In the pride and folly of his heart he had built a splendidly constructed ship in which he could sail through the air. It was as colorful as a peacock's tail, and seemed decorated with a thousand eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a cannon. The Prince could sit in the center of the ship and, upon his touching a certain button, a thousand bullets would stream forth, and the guns would at once be reloaded. Hundreds of strong eagles were harnessed to the ship, and so it flew away, up and up toward the sun.\n\nFar beneath lay the earth. At first its mountains and forests appeared like a plowed field, with a tuft of green peeping out here and there from the sod; then it seemed like an unrolled map, and finally it was wholly hidden in mists and clouds, as the eagles flew higher and higher.\n\nThen God sent forth a single one of His countless angels, and immediately the Prince let fly a thousand bullets at him, but they fell back like hail from the angel's shining wings. Then one drop of blood-just one-fell from one of the angel's white wing feathers onto the ship of the Prince. There it burned itself into it, and its weight of a thousand hundredweights of lead hurled the ship back down with terrible speed to the earth.\n\n The mighty wings of the eagles were broken, the winds roared about the head of the Prince, and the clouds on every side, sprung from the smoke of burned cities, formed themselves into menacing shapes. Some were like mile-long crabs stretching out their huge claws toward him; others were like tumbling boulders or fire-breathing dragons. The Prince lay half dead in his ship, until it was finally caught in the tangled branches of a dense forest.\n\n\"I will conquer God!\" he said. \"I have sworn it; my will shall be done!\" Then for seven years he built other magnificent ships in which to sail through the air, and had lightning beams forged from the hardest of steels, to batter down the battlements of heaven itself. From all the conquered countries he assembled vast armies which, when formed in battle array, covered mile after mile of ground.\n\nThey embarked in the magnificent ships, but as the Prince approached his own, God sent forth a swarm of gnats-just one little swarm-which buzzed about the Prince, and stung his face and hands. In rage he drew his sword, but he could cut only the empty air; he could not strike the gnats. Then he ordered that he be brought costly cloths, which were to be wrapped around him so that no gnat could reach him with its sting. \n\nHis orders were carried out; but one little gnat had concealed itself in the innermost covering, and now it crept into the Prince's ear and stung him. It smarted like fire, and the poison rushed into his brain; he tore the clothes loose and flung them far away from him, rent his garments into rags, and danced naked before the rugged and savage soldiers. Now they could only mock at the mad Prince who had started out to conquer God and had been himself conquered by a single little gnat!"

      "body": "Thumbling:\n\nThere was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and span. Then said he, “How sad it is that we have no children! With us all is so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively.”\n\n“Yes,” replied the wife, and sighed, “even if we had only one, and it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be quite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts.” Now it so happened that their wish was granted and a child was given them, but although it was perfect in all its limbs, it was no longer than a thumb. Then said they, “It is as we wished it to be, and it shall be our dear child;” and because of its size, they called it Thumbling. They did not let it want for food, but the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had been at the first, nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature, for everything it did turned out well.\n\nOne day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, “How I wish that there was any one who would bring the cart to me!” “Oh, father,” cried Thumbling, “I will soon bring the cart; rely on that; it shall be in the forest on time.” The man smiled and said, “How can that be done; you are far too small to lead the horse by the reins?” “That’s of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I will sit in the horse’s ear, and call out to him how he is to go.” “Well,” answered the man, “for once we will try it.”\n\nWhen the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed Thumbling in its ear, and then the little creature cried, “Gee up, gee up!”\n\nThen it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart went the right way into the forest. It so happened that just as he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, “Gee up,” two strange men came towards him. “My word!” said one of them. “What is this? There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to the horse, and still he is not to be seen!”\n\n“That can’t be right,” said the other, “we will follow the cart and see where it stops.” The cart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut. When Thumbling saw his father, he cried to him, “See, father, here I am with the cart; now take me down.”\n\nThe father got hold of the horse with his left hand, and with the right took his little son out of the ear. Thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the two strange men saw him, they did not know what to say for astonishment. Then one of them took the other aside and said, “That little fellow would make our fortune if we made him perform a shoe in a large town, for money. We will buy him.”\n\nThey went to the peasant and said, “Sell us the little man. He shall be well treated with us.” “No,” replied the father, “he is the apple of my eye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.” Thumbling, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up the folds of his father’s coat, placed himself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear. “Father, do give me away; I will soon come back again.”\n\nThen the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome bit of money. “Where do you want to sit?” they said to him. “Oh, just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I can walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and still not fall down.” They did as he wished, and when Thumbling had taken leave of his father, they went away with him. They walked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said, “Do take me down; I want to come down.” The man took his hat off, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and he leaped and crept about a little between the sods, and then he suddenly slipped into a mouse-hole which he had sought out. “Good-evening, gentlemen, just go home without me,” he cried to them, and mocked them. They ran to him and stuck their sticks into the mouse-hole, but it was all a waste of time. Thumbling crept still farther in, and as it soon became quite dark, they were forced to go home with their anger and their empty purses.\n\nWhen Thumbling saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the underground passage. “It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark,” said he; “how easily a neck or a leg is broken!” Fortunately, he knocked against an empty snail-shell. “Thank God!” said he. “In that I can pass the night in safety,” and got into it. Not long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two men go by, and one of them was saying, “How shall we contrive to get hold of the rich pastor’s silver and gold?” “I could tell you that,” cried Thumbling, interrupting them. “What was that?” said one of the thieves in a fright; “I heard some one speaking.” They stood still listening, and Thumbling spoke again and said, “Take me with you, and I’ll help you.”\n\n“But where are you?” “Just look on the ground, and see where my voice comes from,” he replied. There the thieves at length found him, and lifted him up. “You little imp, how will you help us?” they said. “A great deal,” said he; “I will creep into the pastor’s room through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever you want to have.” “Come, then,” they said, “and we will see what you can do.”\n\nWhen they got to the pastor’s house, Thumbling crept into the room, but instantly cried out with all his might, “Do you want to have everything that is here?” The thieves were alarmed, and said, “But do speak softly, so as not to waken any one!” Thumbling, however, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried again, “What do you want? Do you want to have everything that is here?”\n\nThe cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up in bed, and listened. The thieves, however, had in their fright run some distance away, but at last they took courage, and thought, “The little rascal wants to mock us.” They came back and whispered to him, “Come, be serious, and reach something out to us.”\n\nThen Thumbling again cried as loudly as he could, “I really will give you everything, only put your hands in.” The maid who was listening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed and rushed to the door. The thieves took flight, and ran as if the Wild Huntsman were behind them, but as the maid could not see anything, she went to strike a light. When she came to the place with it, Thumbling, unseen, hid himself in the granary, and the maid, after she had examined every corner and found nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that, after all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears.\n\nThumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful place to sleep in: there he intended to rest until day, and then go home again to his parents. But he had other things to go through. Truly there is much affliction and misery in this world! When day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to feed the cows. Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid hold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which poor Thumbling was lying asleep. He, however, was sleeping so soundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he was in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.\n\n“Ah, heavens!” cried he, “how have I got into the fulling mill?” but he soon discovered where he was. Then it was necessary to be careful not to let himself go between the teeth and be bitten in two, but he was nevertheless forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay. “In this little room the windows are forgotten,” said he, “and no sun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.”\n\nHis quarters were especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was, more and more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew less and less. Then, at length in his anguish, he cried as loud as he could, “Bring me no more food, bring me no more food.” The maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard some one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so terrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk. She ran in the greatest haste to her master, and said, “Oh, heavens, pastor, the cow has been speaking!”\n\n“You are mad,” replied the pastor; but he went himself to see what was there. Hardly, however, had he set his foot inside than Thumbling again cried, “Bring me no more food, bring me no more food.” Then the pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil spirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed. She was killed, but the stomach, in which Thumbling was, was thrown off to one side. Thumbling had great difficulty in working his way out; however, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but, just as he was going to poke his head out, a new misfortune occurred. A hungry wolf ran in, and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp. Thumbling did not lose courage. “Perhaps,” thought he, “the wolf will listen to what I have got to say,” and he called to him from out of his stomach, “Dear wolf, I know of a magnificent feast for you.”\n\n“Where is it to be had?” said the wolf.\n\n“In such and such a house; you must creep into it through the kitchen-sink; you will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and as much of them as you can eat,” and he described to him exactly his father’s house. The wolf did not require to be told this twice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to his heart’s content in the larder. When he had eaten his fill, he wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could not go out by the same way.\n\nThumbling had reckoned on this, and now began to make a violent noise in the wolfs body, and raged and screamed as loudly as he could. “Will you be quiet,” said the wolf; “you will waken up the people!” “Eh, what,” replied the little fellow, “you have eaten your fill, and I will make merry likewise,” and began once more to scream with all his strength. At last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the room and looked in through the opening in the door. When they saw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and the husband fetched his axe. “Stay behind,” said the man, when they entered the room. Thumbling heard his parents’ voices, and cried, “Dear father, I am here; I am in the wolf’s body.”\n\nSaid the father, full of joy, “Thank God, our dear child has found us again.”  After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf such a blow on his head that he fell down dead, and soon they got their little son out.\n\n“Ah,” said the father, “what sorrow we have gone through for your sake.” “Yes, father, I have gone about the world a great deal. Thank heaven, I breathe fresh air again!” “Where have you been, then?” “Ah, father, I have been in a mouse’s hole, in a cow’s stomach, and then in a wolf’s; now I will stay with you.” “And we will not sell you again; no, not for all the riches in the world,” said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their dear Thumbling."

      "body": "The Magic Turban, The Magic Sword And The Magic Carpet:\n\nThere were once two brothers, the sons of a rich merchant, and when he died he left all his estate to be divided between them equally. This was done, and the elder at once set about trading and improving his condition, so that very soon he became twice as rich as he had been.\nBut the younger son had no luck. Everything he undertook failed. Moreover, he never had the heart to say no to a friend in need. So before long he was left with not a penny in his purse or a roof over his head.\n\nIn his distress he went to his elder brother and asked help of him.\n\n\"How is this?\" said the elder. \"Our father left the same to both of us, and I have prospered in the world and have now become a rich man, but you have not even a roof to shelter your head or a bite to eat.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a long tale,\" said the younger, \"and what is done is done. But give me another chance, and it may be that this time I will succeed in the world.\"\n\nAfter they had talked a long time the elder brother consented to give him fifty dollars, but if he wasted that the way he had the rest of his property, he was not to come back again.\n\nThe younger brother took the money and went off with it, but it was not long before it had slipped through his fingers just the way his other money had. Before long he was back at his brother's door, asking for help again.\n\nThe older brother scolded and reproached him. He was a spendthrift and a waster. But in the end he gave him another fifty dollars, and bade him be off, and not dare to return again.\n\nThe younger brother went off with the fifty dollars and this time he was sure he would succeed with it. But his luck was still no better than it had been before. Soon it was all gone, and back he came to his brother's house.\n\nSo it went on. The older brother could not rid himself of him. At last the elder brother, seeing there would be no peace for him as long as he remained where he was, made up his mind to sell all his possessions and take the money and journey to a far land without telling his younger brother anything about it.\n\nThis he did, but somehow or other the younger one got wind of it. He found what ship his brother was to sail on, and then he crawled aboard at night, when nobody was watching, and hid himself among the cargo.\n\nThe next day the ship set sail. Soon they were out at sea. Then the elder brother came out on deck and strutted up and down, and he rejoiced at heart that he had shaken off the younger lad and with good luck might never see him again.\n\nBut just as he thought this, whom should he see but the lad coming across the deck to meet him and give him greeting.\n\nThe elder was a sick and sorry man. It seemed there was no ridding himself of his brother. At the first port they touched he left the ship, and his brother got off with him, for he had no idea of being left behind.\n\nThe elder brother stood there on the shore and looked about him. Then he said, \"Listen, now! It is a long way to the town. Do you stay here while I go on farther, beyond yon spit of land, and see whether I can find a dwelling where I can buy us a couple of horses; for I have no wish to journey on foot.\"\n\nThe younger brother was for going along too, but to this the elder would not consent. No, no; the lad was to stay there and watch a box that the elder brother had brought along. (The box had nothing in it, but this the younger brother did not know.)\n\nSo the elder brother set out and soon was out of sight, and the younger one sat on the box and kicked his heels and waited, and waited and waited and waited; but his brother never did come back.\n\nThen the lad knew the older one had made a fool of him. He looked in the box and found it empty. So off he set to see whether he could make his own way in the world and no thanks to any one.\n\nHe journeyed on a short way and a long way, and so he came to a place where three men were quarreling together fiercely, and the things they were quarreling over were an old turban, a piece of carpet, and a sword.\n\nAs soon as they saw the lad they stopped quarreling and ran and caught hold of him. \"You shall decide! You shall decide!\" they shouted all together.\n\n\"What is it you wish me to decide?\" asked the lad.\n\nThen the men told him they were three brothers, and that when their father died he had left them these three things,--the turban, the carpet, and the sword. Whoever placed the turban on his head would at once become invisible. Whoever sat on the carpet had only to wish himself wherever he would be, and the carpet would carry him there in a twinkling, and the sword would cut through anything, and no magic could stand against it.\n\n\"These things should belong to me, because I am the eldest,\" cried one of the men.\n\n\"But I am the youngest and weakest and need them most,\" cried the third. They then began to quarrel again and even came to blows.\n\n\"Stop, stop,\" cried the lad. \"You said that I should decide this matter for you, so why quarrel about it? But before I decide I must try the things and see whether what you have told me is really so.\"\n\nTo this the brothers agreed. First they gave him the sword, and the lad took it in his hand and aimed a blow at a rock near by, and the sword cut through the rock as smoothly and easily as though it had been a piece of cheese.\n\n\"Now give me the turban,\" said the lad.\n\n\"No, I should have them because I am the strongest and stoutest,\" said the second.\n\nThe brothers gave him the turban, and he placed it upon his head and at once became invisible!\n\n\"Now the carpet.\"\n\nThe brothers spread out the carpet on the ground, and the lad seated himself upon it with the turban still upon his head and the sword in his hand! Then he wished himself far away in some place where the brothers would never find him.\n\nImmediately he found himself in the outskirts of a large city. He stepped from the carpet and rolled it up and took the turban from his head and looked about him. He had no idea of going back to return the things to the brothers, and if they waited for him they waited a long time. \"It will teach them not to quarrel but to live at peace with each other,\" said the lad to himself. Then he made his way to the nearest house, for he was hungry and meant to ask for a bite to eat.\n\nHe knocked, and an old woman opened the door, and she was so old that her chin and her nose met.\n\n\"Good day, mother,\" said the lad.\n\n\"Good day to you,\" answered the crone.\n\n\"Will you give me a bite to eat, for the love of charity?\"\n\nYes, the crone would do that. She gave him a bite and a sup and a bit over, and while he was eating and drinking she sat and talked with him.\n\n\"What is the news here in the city?\" asked the lad.\n\n\"Oh the same news as ever.\"\n\n\"And what is that? For I am a stranger here and know no more of yesterday or the week before than of to-day.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you. Over yonder lies the castle, and the King lives there. He has only one daughter, and she is a beauty, you may believe. Every night the Princess disappears from the castle, and where she goes no one can tell but herself, and she will not. So the King has offered a reward to any one who will find out. The half of his kingdom he offers and the hand of the Princess as well, if only any one can tell him where she goes.\"\n\n\"That is a good hearing,\" said the lad. \"I have a mind to try for that prize myself.\"\n\n\"No, but wait a bit,\" said the old woman. \"There is another side to the story, for if you try and fail your head will be lifted from your shoulders with a sharp sword, and you are too fine a young man to lose your life in that way.\"\n\nBut the lad was determined to try. In vain the old woman warned and entreated him. He thanked her for the meal he had eaten, and then off he set for the palace. There he told the errand that had brought him and after that it did not take long for him to get to see the King.\n\n\"So you think you can find out where the Princess goes at night,\" said the King.\n\nYes, the lad thought he could.\n\nVery well, then, he might have a try at it, but he must remember that if he tried and failed his head would be cut from his shoulders with a sharp sword.\n\nYes, the lad understood that, and he was ready to take the risk.\n\nSo that night he was taken to the door of a room in a high tower, and the room was of iron and had only one door and one window. Into this room the Princess was put every night, and it would be the duty of the lad to watch at the door and see either that she did not leave it, or where she went.\n\nPresently the Princess came upstairs and passed by the lad without so much as a glance, but his heart leaped within him, she was so beautiful.\n\nShe opened the door to go in, and the lad put on his turban of darkness and slipped in after her, but the Princess did not know that because he was invisible. She closed the door tight and sighed three times, and then a great black demon stood before her, and he was terrible to look upon, he was so huge and ugly.\n\n\"Oh, my dear Lala,\" said the Princess, \"let us be off at once. I do not know why, but I feel so frightened, just as though some misfortune were about to come upon me.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense,\" said the demon. \"But do you seat yourself upon my head, and we will be off at once.\"\n\nThe demon wore a buckler upon his head, and now he stooped, and she seated herself upon it, but the lad was quick and sprang up and took his place beside her.\n\n\"Ai! Ai!\" cried the demon, \"but you are heavy to-day, Princess.\"\n\n[Illustration: Then the demon flew out through the window and away through the night.]\n\n\"I do not know what you mean,\" answered the Princess. \"I am no heavier and no lighter than I was last night.\"\n\nThen the demon flew out through the window and away through the night so fast that the lad had much ado to keep from falling off.\n\nAfter a while they came to a garden the like of which the lad had never seen before and never expected to see again, for the leaves of the trees were of silver, and the branches were of gold, and the fruits were emeralds and rubies.\n\nAs they passed through it the lad stretched out his hand and broke off a twig and put it in his bosom. Then all the trees in the garden began to sigh and moan.\n\n\"Child of man! Child of man! why do you break and torture us?\"\n\nThe Princess shuddered. \"Some one besides ourselves is here in the garden,\" she cried.\n\n\"That cannot be, or we would see him,\" answered the demon, but he was frightened and flew on faster than before.\n\nPresently they came to another garden and it was even more wonderful than the first, for here the trees were of diamonds, and the fruits of every kind of precious stones you can think of.\n\nAs they passed through it the lad stretched out his hand and broke off a twig. Then all the trees began to sigh and moan.\n\n\"Child of man! Child of man! Why do you break and torture us?\" they cried.\n\n\"Oh, my dear Lala, what did I tell you?\" asked the Princess. \"I am afraid\"; and she trembled all over her body.\n\nThe demon answered nothing, but he flew on even faster than ever.\n\nSoon after they came to a magnificent palace, and the demon flew in through a window and alighted. Then the Princess and the lad leaped down from the buckler, and the demon was glad to have the weight off him. After that he vanished.\n\nThe Princess opened a door and went into another room, with the lad close behind her, and there was the King of all the demons, and he was so huge and black that the demon Lala was nothing to him.\n\n\"My dearest dear one, why are you so late to-night?\" asked he of the Princess.\n\n\"I do not know what was the matter,\" answered the fair one, \"but something is terribly wrong\"; and she told him all that had happened.\n\nThe Demon laughed at her. \"You are nervous,\" said he. \"But come! You have not kissed me yet.\"\n\nHe came close to the Princess to kiss her, but the lad stepped between them and gave the Demon such a push that he almost fell over; at the same time he himself gave the Princess a kiss upon the cheek.\n\n\"Why do you push me away?\" cried the Demon, and he was very angry.\n\nThe Princess began to tremble again. \"I did not push you,\" said she. \"Moreover, some one kissed me on the cheek. I am sure somebody is in the room with us.\"\n\nThe King Demon looked all around, but he could see nobody. Then he called a slave to bring the Princess the jeweled slippers she always wore when she came to his palace.\n\nThe slave brought the slippers on a golden cushion, and they were crusted over with pearls and precious stones. He knelt before the Princess, and she took one and put it on, but at the same time the lad took the other and slipped it in his bosom. The Princess and the Demon did not know what had become of it. They hunted everywhere, but they could not find it.\n\n\"There, now! See how careless you are,\" said the Demon; and he bade the slave bring another pair of slippers.\n\nThis the slave did, but it was the same with this pair as with the others. While the Princess was putting on one slipper the lad took the other and hid it in his bosom. The Princess and the Demon and the slave all looked for it, but they could not find it.\n\nAt that the Princess flew into a passion and threw both the slippers away from her.\n\n\"I do not care,\" said she; \"and now I will not wear any slippers at all.\"\n\n\"Never mind!\" answered the Demon. \"We will have a sherbet together, and after that we will eat.\"\n\nHe clapped his hands, and another slave appeared, bearing two crystal goblets full of sherbet. The Princess took one goblet and the Demon the other. Just as they were about to drink the lad smote the crystal goblet from the Princess's hand so that it fell upon the marble floor and was shattered, and all the sherbet was spilled.\n\nThe lad picked up a splinter of the crystal and hid it in his bosom with the golden twig, the diamond twig, and the two slippers. But the Princess shook and trembled until she could hardly stand, and even the Demon was troubled.\n\n\"Why did you cast the goblet on the floor?\" he asked.\n\n\"I did not,\" answered the Princess, \"but some one struck it from my hand\"; and she began to weep.\n\nThe Demon comforted her and bade other slaves bring in the feast that had been prepared for him and the Princess.\n\nQuickly the slaves brought it and placed it before them. The lad had never seen such a feast. All the dishes were of gold and were carved to represent scenes in demon life, and the handles were set thick with precious stones and enamelled in strange colors. There were all sorts of delicious things to eat, so that the lad's mouth watered at the smell of them.\n\nThe Demon and the Princess sat down to eat, but it was small good the Princess got of the feast, for every time the Demon put anything on her plate the lad snatched it away and ate it, and the Princess was left hungry. The lad also took one of the golden forks and one of the golden spoons and hid them in his bosom.\n\n\"What did I tell you,\" cried the Princess. \"Something is wrong! Something is terribly wrong.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can see that myself,\" said the King Demon. \"You had better go on home again, for we will get no pleasure out of this night, and that I can easily see.\"\n\nLala was called, the Princess mounted the buckler in haste, and away the Demon flew with her. But this time the lad did not fly with them.\n\nHe waited until they were gone, and then he drew the Sword of Sharpness and smote the King Demon's head from his shoulders.\n\nAt once a clap of thunder sounded; the castle rocked, and the walls crumbled about him. The trees in the gardens were withered, and a thick darkness fell, while all about him sounded cries and groans.\n\nBut the lad seated himself upon the carpet and wished himself back at the door of the room in the tower, and there he was in a twinkling, long before Lala had flown in through the window with the Princess, even though he flew as swiftly as the wind.\n\nThe lad took off the Turban of Darkness, and rolled up the carpet, and lay down and closed his eyes as though he were asleep.\n\nPresently the Princess opened the door and peered out. There lay the lad, snoring and with his eyes closed. The Princess drew a sharp needle and ran it into the lad's heel, but he never flinched, so she felt sure he was asleep.\n\n\"Thou fool!\" said she scornfully. \"Sleep on, and to-morrow thou shalt pay the penalty.\"\n\nThen she went back into the room and closed the door.\n\nThe next day the Princess called the guards and bade them carry the lad away and cut the head from his shoulders.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said the lad. \"Do not be in such a hurry. First we must appear before thy father the King; he must decide in this case, and it may be I have something to tell him that will be worth the hearing.\"\n\nThe Princess could not refuse this, so she and the lad were brought before the King, and the lad began to tell his story. When he came to the part where the great black Demon had come and flown away with the Princess she turned first as red as blood and then as pale as death.\n\n\"It is not true!\" she cried, but the King bade her be silent.\n\nThen the lad told how they had flown through the gardens. \"It is all a wicked lie,\" moaned the Princess, but the lad drew forth the twigs he had broken from the trees and showed them to the King as proof of his truth.\n\nAfter that the lad told of how they had entered the castle, and how the King Demon had tried to kiss the Princess, and of the shattered goblet and the uneaten feast, and he had the splinter of crystal and the spoon and fork to show, so the King knew it was all true, and the Princess looked as though she wished she were dead.\n\nLast of all he told how the Princess had returned on the Demon's buckler, and how he had remained behind and cut off the King Demon's head, and how the castle had fallen and the gardens had withered, and all had become darkness and confusion.\n\nWhen the Princess heard this she gave a shriek of joy. \"Then you have saved me!\" she cried. \"Never again need I fly forth at night at the will of the Demon nor be his slave!\"\n\nThen it was her turn to tell her story. She told how one time the King Demon had seen her walking in the palace gardens and had fallen in love with her, and how he had used his magic to gain power over her. She told how she hated him and feared him, but how against her will he had forced her to come to visit him every night in his castle and had sent the demon Lala to fetch her. But now that the King Demon was dead, she was free, and it was the lad who had saved her.\n\nWhen the King, her father, heard this, he marveled greatly. Glad was he that such a brave lad was to be his son-in-law, for that was his promise. The lad and the Princess were betrothed then and there, and the King gave orders that a grand wedding feast should be prepared, for they were to be married as soon as possible. All the good folks far and near were invited to come to the feast.\n\nThe lad's elder brother was invited with the rest, but he never dreamed that the brave lad who was to marry the Princess was his own younger brother.\n\nHe came to the palace on the feast day and took his place at the table with the other guests, and then he looked up at the three thrones where the King and the Princess and the lad were sitting, and there it was his own younger brother who sat there.\n\nWhen the man saw that he was afraid, for he remembered how he had deserted the lad on the seashore to live or die as fate willed, and he feared he might be punished for it.\n\nBut the younger brother bore him no grudge, but was grateful to him for what he had done. As soon as he saw the elder one there among the guests, he sent a servant for him and placed him in the seat of honor and called him brother.\n\nSo all was happiness and rejoicing. Everybody was happy, but the lad and the Princess were happiest of all, because they loved each other and had just been married."

      "body": "Little Dorothy and Toto:\n\nDorothy was a little Kansas girl who once accidentally found the beautiful Land of Oz and was invited to live there always. Toto was Dorothy’s small black dog, with fuzzy, curly hair and bright black eyes. Together, when they tired of the grandeur of the Emerald City of Oz, they would wander out into the country and all through the land,peering into queer nooks and corners and having a good time in their own simple way. There was a little Wizard living in Oz who was a faithful friend of Dorothy and did not approve of her traveling alone in this way, but the girl always laughed at the little man’s fears for her and said she was not afraid of anything that might happen.\n\nOne day while on such a journey, Dorothy and Toto found themselves among the wild wooded hills at the southeast of Oz—a place usually avoided by travelers because so many magical things abounded there. And, as they entered a forest path, the little girl noticed a sign tacked to a tree,\n\nwhich said: “Look out for Crinklink.”\n\nToto could not talk, as many of the animals of Oz can, for he was just a common Kansas dog; but he looked at the sign so seriously that Dorothy almost believed he could read it, and she knew quite well that Toto understood every word she said to him.\n\n“Never mind Crinklink,” said she. “I don’t believe anything in Oz will try to hurt us, Toto, and if I get into trouble you must take care of me.”\n\n“Bow-wow!” said Toto, and Dorothy knew that meant a promise.\n\nThe path was narrow and wound here and there between the trees, but they could not lose their way, because thick vines and creepers shut them in on both sides. They had walked a long time when, suddenly turning a curve of the pathway, they came upon a lake of black water, so big and so deep that they were forced to stop.\n\n“Well, Toto,” said Dorothy, looking at the lake, “we must turn back, I guess, for there is neither a bridge nor a boat to take us across the black water.”\n\n“Here’s the ferryman, though,” cried a tiny voice beside them, and the girl gave a start and looked down at her feet, where a man no taller than three inches sat at the edge of the path with his legs dangling over the lake.\n\n“Oh!” said Dorothy; “I didn’t see you before.”\n\nToto growled fiercely and made his ears stand up straight, but the little man did not seem in the least afraid of the dog. He merely repeated: “I’m the ferryman, and it’s my business to carry people across the lake.”\n\nDorothy couldn’t help feeling surprised, for she could have picked the little man up with one hand, and the lake was big and broad. Looking at the ferryman more closely she saw that he had small eyes, a big nose, and a sharp chin. His hair was blue and his clothes scarlet, and Dorothy noticed that every button on his jacket was the head of some animal. The top button was a bear’s head and the next button a wolf’s head; the next was a cat’s head and the next a weasel’s head, while the last button of all was the head of a field-mouse. When Dorothy looked into the eyes of these animals’ heads, they all nodded and said in a chorus: “Don’t believe all you hear, little girl!”\n\n“Silence!” said the small ferryman, slapping each button head in turn, but not hard enough to hurt them. Then he turned to Dorothy and asked: “Do you wish to cross over the lake?”\n\n“Why, I’d like to,” she answered, hesitating; “but I can’t see how you will manage to carry us, without any boat.”\n\n“If you can’t see, you mustn’t see,” he answered with a laugh. “All you need do is shut your eyes, say the word, and—over you go!”\n\nDorothy wanted to get across, in order that she might continue her journey.\n\n“All right,” she said, closing her eyes; “I’m ready.”\n\nInstantly she was seized in a pair of strong arms—arms so big and powerful that she was startled and cried out in fear.\n\n“Silence!” roared a great voice, and the girl opened her eyes to find that the tiny man had suddenly grown to a giant and was holding both her and Toto in a tight embrace while in one step he spanned the lake and reached the other shore.\n\nDorothy became frightened, then, especially as the giant did not stop but continued tramping in great steps over the wooded hills, crushing bushes and trees beneath his broad feet. She struggled in vain to free herself, while Toto whined and trembled beside her, for the little dog was frightened, too.\n\n“Stop!” screamed the girl. “Let me down!” But the giant paid no attention. “Who are you, and where are you taking me?” she continued; but the giant said not a word. Close to Dorothy’s ear, however, a voice answered her, saying: “This is the terrible Crinklink, and he has you in his power.”\n\nDorothy managed to twist her head around and found it was the second button on the jacket—the wolf’s head—which had spoken to her.\n\n“What will Crinklink do with me?” she asked anxiously.\n\n“No one knows. You must wait and see,” replied the wolf.\n\n“Some of his captives he whips,” squeaked the weasel’s head.\n\n“Some he transforms into bugs and other things,” growled the bear’s head.\n\n“Some he enchants, so that they become doorknobs,” sighed the cat’s head.\n\n“Some he makes his slaves—even as we are—and that is the most dreadful fate of all,” added the field-mouse. “As long as Crinklink exists we shall remain buttons, but as there are no more buttonholes on his jacket he will probably make you a slave.”\n\nDorothy began to wish she had not met Crinklink. Meantime, the giant took such big steps that he soon reached the heart of the hills, where, perched upon the highest peak, stood a log castle. Before this castle he paused to set down Dorothy and Toto, for Crinklink was at present far too large to enter his own doorway. So he made himself grow smaller, until he was about the size of an ordinary man. Then he said to Dorothy, in stern, commanding tones:\n\n“Enter, girl!”\n\nDorothy obeyed and entered the castle, with Toto at her heels. She found the place to be merely one big room. There was a table and chair of ordinary size near the center, and at one side a wee bed that seemed scarcely big enough for a doll. Everywhere else were dishes—dishes—dishes! They were all soiled, and were piled upon the floor, in all the corners and upon every shelf. Evidently Crinklink had not washed a dish for years, but had cast them aside as he used them.\n\nDorothy’s captor sat down in the chair and frowned at her.\n\n“You are young and strong, and will make a good dishwasher,” said he.\n\n“Do you mean me to wash all those dishes?” she asked, feeling both indignant and fearful, for such a task would take weeks to accomplish.\n\n“That’s just what I mean,” he retorted. “I need clean dishes, for all I have are soiled, and you’re going to make ’em clean or get trounced. So get to work and be careful not to break anything. If you smash a dish, the penalty is one lash from my dreadful cat-o’-nine-tails for every piece the dish breaks into,” and here Crinklink displayed a terrible whip that made the little girl shudder.\n\nDorothy knew how to wash dishes, but she remembered that often she carelessly broke one. In this case, however, a good deal depended on being careful, so she handled the dishes very cautiously.\n\nWhile she worked, Toto sat by the hearth and growled low at Crinklink, and Crinklink sat in his chair and growled at Dorothy because she moved so slowly. He expected her to break a dish any minute, but as the hours passed away and this did not happen Crinklink began to grow sleepy. It was tiresome watching the girl wash dishes and often he glanced longingly at the tiny bed. Now he began to yawn, and he yawned and yawned until finally he said:\n\n“I’m going to take a nap. But the buttons on my jacket will be wide awake and whenever you break a dish the crash will waken me. As I’m rather sleepy I hope you won’t interrupt my nap by breaking anything for a long time.”\n\nThen Crinklink made himself grow smaller and smaller until he was three inches high and of a size to fit the tiny bed. At once he lay down and fell fast asleep.\n\nDorothy came close to the buttons and whispered: “Would you really warn Crinklink if I tried to  escape?”\n\n“You can’t escape,” growled the bear. “Crinklink would become a giant, and soon overtake you.”\n\n“But you might kill him while he sleeps,” suggested the cat, in a soft voice.\n\n“Oh!” cried Dorothy, drawing back; “I couldn’t poss’bly kill anything—even to save my life.”\n\nBut Toto had heard this conversation and was not so particular about killing monsters. Also the little dog knew he must try to save his mistress. In an instant he sprang upon the wee bed and was about to seize the sleeping Crinklink in his jaws when Dorothy heard a loud crash and a heap of dishes fell from the table to the floor. Then the girl saw Toto and the little man rolling on the floor together, like a fuzzy ball, and when the ball stopped rolling, behold! there was Toto wagging his tail joyfully and there sat the little Wizard of Oz, laughing merrily at the expression of surprise on Dorothy’s face.\n\n“Yes, my dear, it’s me,” said he, “and I’ve been playing tricks on you—for your own good. I wanted to prove to you that it is really dangerous for a little girl to wander alone in a fairy country; so I took the form of Crinklink to teach you a lesson. There isn’t any Crinklink, to be sure; but if there had been you’d be severely whipped for breaking all those dishes.”\n\nThe Wizard now rose, took off the coat with the button heads, and spread it on the floor, wrong side up. At once there crept from beneath it a bear, a wolf, a cat, a weasel, and a field-mouse, who all  rushed from the room and escaped into the mountains.\n\n“Come on, Toto,” said Dorothy; “let’s go back to the Emerald City. You’ve given me a good scare, Wizard,” she added, with dignity, “and p’raps I’ll forgive you, by’n’by; but just now I’m mad to think how easily you fooled me.”"

      "body": "King Chandra And The Monkey Chief:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a king by the name of Chandra. He had a beautiful palace surrounded by a huge garden. In this garden there lived many birds. Even monkeys had their homes in it. The king had also\n\nI a goat for his sons to play with. The goat had long wool like hair on his body. Being a glutton he would enter into the royal kitchen and eat whatever food was stocked there. The chief cook didn't like this goat and would, sometimes, beat him with smouldering sticks to drive him out of the kitchen.\n\nThe chief of the monkeys had witnessed the scene many times. He was very intelligent. Seeing the hairy goat being thrashed with smouldering sticks almost everyday, he thought to himself: \"This hairy goat, despite being thrashed with smouldering sticks by the chief cook repeatedly, doesn't shun his habit. This may become very irritating for the cooks. One day the cooks might set the hairy goat on fire. The goat might rush into the stable with his wool like hair blazing and roll onto the hay in pain and panic. As a result the hay will catch fire. Thus many horses will get burnt. And it is said that the fat of a freshly killed monkey is applied to cure the burns of a horse. If such a situation ever arises, we monkeys are sure to be slaughtered.\"\n\nThe chief of the monkeys, then, advised his followers to abandon the palace garden, as early as possible, But the other monkeys didn't pay heed to his sincere advice. So the monkey chief decided to himself leave the palace garden and go to some other distant place, where he would be safe and secure. So he left for a distant jungle to live in there.\n\nOne day, shortly after the goat had entered the royal kitchen, a cook picked up a burning log and struck the goat with it. The goat's hair caught fire. The goat rushed into the stable with his hair blazing. He rolled over the heap of hay to extinguish the fire but instead, the hay caught fire. The flames leapt up to the roof of the stable. Many horses were burnt to death whereas a number of them received burn injuries. The king was shocked to learn that his horses had sustained burn injuries. He called the veterinary doctor for treatment of the animals. The doctor advised the king to bring monkey fat. He said, \"Your Majesty, if the fat of a freshly killed monkey is applied to the burns of the horses, they would be cured.\"\n\nThe king immediately ordered for the killing of the monkey s. Soon thousands of monkeys were killed and their fat was applied to the burns of the horses.\n\nWhen the monkey-chief who was living in some other jungle came to know of this killing, he became very sad. He vowed to take revenge on the king.\n\nOnce the chief of monkeys went to a nearby lake to quench his thirst. There, his attention was diverted to some footprints which were all pointing towards the lake, but not a single one was pointing away from the lake. Just then, a big black giant (Rakshasa) came out of the lake's water, with a necklace of jewels round his neck. The chief of monkeys was frightened, but the black giant said, \"I'm very happy with you. You were clever not to enter the lake. Whoever enters this lake is eaten by me. I can eat thousands of people at a time. I'm pleased with you. You may ask me for granting a boon to you. Please speak.\"\n\n\"So listen!\" said the monkey chief, \"I've great enmity with king Chandra. He ordered the slaughter of my brothers, for the purpose of using their fat to rub on the burnt skin of the horses.\"\n\n\"Bring the king and his men into this lake and I'll devour all of them,\" the black monster said to the monkey-chief.\n\n\"Please give me your jewel necklace,\" the monkey-chief said. \"I'll bring you a lot of royal people for your meal.\"\n\nThe black giant happily gave the necklace to the monkey-chief.\n\nThe monkey-chief put the necklace round his neck and went to the king's palace. The chief of monkey told the king that there was a lake nearby and it was full of jewels. He said that he had brought one such necklace to show as sample. The king listened intently about the lake of jewels and asked the monkey-chief to tell more about it.\n\nThe monkey-chief said, \"To get a jewel necklace, like the one I've, one has to take a bath in the lake before sunrise. So, please take all your men with you to the lake, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe king became very happy with this invitation. The next morning he set out for the lake with his family members and hundreds of his courtiers.\n\nAfter arriving at the lake the monkey-chief said to the king, \"Your Majesty, wait here. Let others go into the lake first to take the necklace. Since you're a king, you'll be presented with a special necklace.\"\n\nWhile the king waited near the lake, his family members and courtiers all jumped into the lake to collect the jewelled necklace.\n\nThe king waited for a long time for his family members to emerge out of the lake. But none of them came out.\n\nIn the meantime, the monkey-chief climbed up a nearby tree. He said to the king, \"You foolish king! Your family members and courtiers, all have been devoured by the black Rakshasa living in the lake. You killed my family and I've had my revenge on you. There is a saying;'It's no sin to return evil for evil.' I saved you because once you were my master.\"\n\nWhen the king heard this he became sad and returned to his kingdom crestfallen.\n\nMoral: Tit for Tat."

      "body": "The Four Foolish Brahmins:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived four Brahmin friends in a village. They were learned persons, but were not satisfied with the knowledge they possessed. So one day, they decided to join some good university in some other part of the country for the sake of learning.\n\nThe next day, they travelled to Kanyakubja. There they got admission in the university. They studied at the university for ten long years.\n\nOne day, they said to each other, 'We've now acquired enough knowledge of Sanskrit and other subjects. Let us go back to our native village.'\n\nThe four learned friends, then, set off for the long journey. After travelling for hours they arrived at a place, where two roads met. The four pandits got puzzled. They didn't know which road to follow. At the same time, a funeral procession passed by on its way to crematorium. There were some prominent citizens walking along with the procession. One of the Brahmins consulted his shastras: 'Follow the road, which is followed by eminent people.' So all of them started following the procession.\n\nWhen they reached the crematoruim, they saw a donkey standing there. They didn't know what to do with the donkey. So the other Brahmin took out his Shastra and began to read it: 'Whosoever meets you at the crematorium is your true friend.'\n\nAnd so, while one of the Brahmins put his arms round the donkey's neck, the others touched his feet with respect. Just then, they saw, at a distance, a camel moving quickly towards the crematorium. The third Brahmin, then consulted his books, which said: 'Religion spreads rapidly. It must be tied with something friendly.'\n\nSo the four Brahmins thought, that the camel was the religion because it was walking swiftly and so the friendly donkey should be introduced to the camel - the religion. When the camel came nearer, they tied its neck together with the donkey's neck.\n\nWhen the owner of the donkey, a washerman, came to know of this, he picked up a stick and started chasing the Brahmins. All the four Brahmins ran for their lives.\n\n.While being chased by the washerman, the four Brahmins came to a river. There in the river, they saw a Palash Leaf floating on the surface of water. One of the Brahmins said, \"This leaf is like a raft. It'll save our lives.” And with these words, he jumped on to the leaf. As a result, the Brahmin began to drown as he did not know how to swim. The second Brahmin, then, caught hold of his hair and said, \"When a thing is going to be fully destroyed, a wise man saves at least half of it.\" So he cut the drowning Brahmin into two halves with a sword.\n\nThe remaining three Brahmins proceeded further on their journey. They reached a village, where they were welcomed by the villagers and invited for lunch and dinner.\n\nOne of the Brahmins was served with a noodle like long substance. The Brahmin, then, consulted his Shastras and read out the verse, which said: 'Anything lengthy is a cause of destruction.' So he didn't take his meal and went away hungry.\n\nThe second Brahmin was served a coconut dish in his lunch. Seeing the dish, the Brahmin remembered the verse that said: 'Frothy things have temporary life.' So, the Brahmin left his food and went away without eating anything.\n\nThe third Brahmin was served with a dish round in shape. Seeing the hole in the middle of the cake like round rice and pulse dish, the Brahmin thought of the verse which meant: 'the holes are like defects and are a sure sign of approaching disaster'.\n\nSo, the third Brahmin also left the village without taking his meals. \n\nIn the end, the three learned idiots had to go hungry for days till they returned to their native village.\n\nMoral: Theoretical knowledge without the practical experience and commonsense is useless."

But the prince paid no heed to their sensible advices.\n\nOne day, the king saw a sage walking in front of the palace. He had an alms bowl in his hand. The king saw his glowing face with rediance and was very much impressed with the way the sage was walking. His gait suggested that the sage was full of confidence and divine knowledge. The king asked one of his ministers to invite the sage to his court.\n\nThe sage came to the king's court. He was received with great honour by the king and his courtiers.\n\nWhen the king came to know that the sage was trying to find out a good dwelling place for himself, he offered him a hermitage in his palace. The sage accepted the offer of the king and started living in the hermitage.\n\nOne day, the king said to the sage, \"You would have probably come to know by now, that my son is very ill-tempered and bad mannered. The people of my kingdom call him an unworthy prince. They don't want him to succeed me as king. I request you kindly to teach the prince to mend his ways.\" Then the king discussed other matters of his kingdom with the sage and left his son under his direct care and guidance with a confidence that the sage will definitely ameliorate the prince and bring a positive reform in him.\n\nThe next day, the sage took the prince for a walk through the garden of the palace. Pointing to a tiny plant the sage said to the prince, \"Eat a leaf of this plant and tell me how it tastes.\"\n\nThe moment the prince tasted the leaf he immediately spat it on th ground. \"It seems to be a poisonous seedling. If it is allowed to grow into a big tree, it may prove dangerous for the health of many people.\" The prince pulled the tiny plant out of the ground and tore it to pieces.\n\nThen the sage picked up the torned and mutilated plant and said to the prince, \"As you've reacted in the case of this plant, the people of your kingdom may, one day, react in the same manner with you, because they think you are a wicked prince. They may not allow you to rule the kingdom and may send you to exile. So it is much better that you mend your ways to create a feeling of mercy, compassion and kind heartedness all around \"\n\nThe prince understood the message of the sage. From that day onwards, he tried to grow humble and kind hearted, full of mercy and love.\n\nThe king was pleased and extremely happy to see such a big change in his son. He thanked the sage and expressed his gratefulness for his kindness.\n\nMoral: Bad temperament doesn't win the hearts of people"

      "body": "How the tortoise got its crippled shale:\n\nA long time ago, a terrible famine hit an ancient animal kingdom. It had not rained for two whole years and all of the crops were dying. The animals hoped and prayed for an end to the terrible drought, but the sky was no longer able to gather enough clouds, and the rains did not come.\n\nIjapa, the cunning tortoise, lived on the outskirts of the village with his wife and two sons.\n\nThe famine was very bad and was already having a devastating effect on all the animals, so Ijapa could no longer trick them into parting with the little rations of food they possessed.\n\nOne morning, very tired and hungry, Ijapa left his house with the intention of searching the marketplace for scraps of food, but there was no food in the market, and so the tortoise remained as hungry as ever.\n\nHowever, just as the tortoise was about to return home he saw Ehoro, the rabbit, hopping towards the marketplace. There was something strange about Ehoro. He looked radiant, well fed, and full of exuberance.\n\nIjapa was curious.\n\n‘Why is Ehoro looking so well and I am so hungry?’ he thought. So he approached the rabbit with his head bowed as if he were in mourning and he began to cry.\n\nWhen Ehoro saw Ijapa, he rushed to meet him. ‘What is it, my friend?’ asked the kindly rabbit.\n\nIjapa answered, ‘My father is ill in hospital. My wife is expecting our third child but she is so hungry that I fear for her very health. And only last night I heard that my mother-in-law is dying of starvation because she does not have enough food to eat! I feel terrible because there is nothing I can do!’\n\nEhoro was suspicious because it was well known that the tortoise was very cunning and could not always be trusted. But Ijapa was an excellent performer and soon won the rabbit’s sympathy.\n\n‘Meet me at Ore Brook after dark,’ said Ehoro. ‘I will help you in spite of my doubts. I just hope I do not regret this.’\n\n*\n\nSoon it was night, and Ijapa set out into the darkness to find Ehoro waiting at the brook. Once they had said their hellos, both animals made their way into the deep forest: the rabbit leading the way while the tortoise followed closely behind. Before long, they came to a narrow path that led to an opening clearing among the trees in the middle of the forest.\n\nThe rabbit stopped and pulled the tortoise to his side. ‘What you are about to see must be kept a secret, do you understand?’ The tortoise nodded in agreement and the rabbit cupped his hands around his mouth and began to sing...\n\n‘Iya, iya ta’kun wale o\nCHORUS: Alu jan jan ki jan\n‘Iya, iya ta’kun wale o\nCHORUS: Alu jan jan ki jan\n\nSuddenly, a long, white rope descended from the sky. Ehoro grabbed the rope and began to climb. After hesitating for just a moment, Ijapa also took a hold of the rope and followed the rabbit up into the night sky.\n\nThe rabbit and the tortoise climbed and climbed until they got to the very top of the rope where there was a magnificent fluffy cloud shaped like a door. The door opened, and there stood a kindly old rabbit with a smile upon her face.\n\n‘Mother!’ exclaimed Ehoro in a joyful voice as he embraced the old rabbit. ‘This is my friend Ijapa who has come for supper.’\n\nEhoro’s mother held out her hand and gave the tortoise a warm handshake. ‘Come in and eat with us. I have set the table.’\n\nThe sight that met Ijapa’s eyes made him gasp. There was a large table laden with the most sumptuous food he had ever seen. There were exotic fruits and fresh fish of all types marinated and cooked with herbs. There was also rice and yam and mouth-watering soups. The hungry tortoise dug in immediately and ate everything that he could lay his hands on.\n\n‘Don’t eat too much,’ Ehoro cautioned, ‘or you will not be able to climb back down the rope and walk back to the village.’\n\nThe tortoise continued to eat until eventually he slumped back in his chair and gazed sheepishly around the room, his belly protruding like a huge balloon.\n\nAfter they had rested for a while, Ehoro decided that it was time to return home. Ijapa rubbed his large belly, got up to his feet very slowly, and made his way to the door.\n\n‘Aren’t you going to take some food back home for your family?’ Ehoro’s mother asked Ijapa.\n\n‘No thank you,’ replied Ijapa. ‘I am too full in my belly to carry any food with me.’ \n\nAnd so Ehoro’s mother let down the rope and the rabbit and the tortoise descended back into the forest and went their separate ways home.\n\n*\n\nWhen Ijapa got home his family were still sleeping, so he crept into his bed, covered himself up with his blanket, and fell into a deep sleep for twelve hours.\n\nWhen he eventually awoke, Ijapa was very hungry. ‘I need food,’ he thought to himself. ‘I need food and I need it now.’\n\nIt was then that Ijapa had an idea. ‘I will go back to Ehoro’s house while he is still at work. I will think of some lies to tell his mother when she lets down the rope, and I will fill my belly once again.’\n\nWhen Ijapa arrived at the open space in the forest, he cleared his throat and began to sing the same song that Ehoro had sung the previous night...\n\n‘Iya, iya ta’kun wale o\nCHORUS: Alu jan jan ki jan\n‘Iya, iya ta’kun wale o\nCHORUS: Alu jan jan ki jan’\n\nThe trouble was, Ijapa had a rather husky voice and the song did not sound as beautiful or as heartfelt as when it was sung by Ehoro.\n\n‘That does not sound like my son,’ thought Ehoro’s mother. The old rabbit hesitated for a moment, but eventually she decided to let down the rope. ‘Perhaps he has caught a cold,’ she thought, as she lowered the rope into the clearing below.\n\nThe cunning tortoise was delighted to see the rope fall to the ground and he quickly grabbed it with both hands and began to climb as fast as he could.\n\n*\n\nIjapa was half way up the rope when he heard a voice shouting from the forest below.\n\n‘Hey, where do you think you’re going? Come back down at once!’\n\nIt was Ehoro, and he sounded very angry. ‘Mother, we’ve been tricked!’ shouted the rabbit. Still Ijapa continued to climb the rope, his mind full of thoughts of the feast awaiting him above.\n\nEhoro called out to his mother again, but nothing happened. And so the cunning tortoise continued to climb up the rope into the clouds.\n\nEhoro cleared his throat, took a very deep breath, and began to sing to his mother up in the clouds...\n\n‘Iya, iya ta’kun wale o\nCHORUS: Alu jan jan ki jan\n‘Iya, iya ta’kun wale o\nCHORUS: Alu jan jan ki jan\n\nWhen Ehoro’s mother heard her son’s voice she exclaimed: ‘Now that is my son! But who was the first caller?’\n\nThe old rabbit peeped through the clouds to see what was happening below. That was when she saw the cunning tortoise climbing up the rope towards her.\n\n‘Mother!’ shouted Ehoro from far below. ‘Cut the rope! Cut the rope!’\n\nThe old rabbit fetched a large carving knife and began to cut at the rope. At first it seemed as if the rope was made of iron and that the knife would have no effect at all. But Ehoro’s mother continued to hack at the rope with all her might and soon there was only a very thin strand left for the tortoise to hang on to. Then the old rabbit gave the rope a final hack with the knife and whooooaaaahhhh! Ijapa went tumbling down towards the forest below.\n\nThe winds carried Ijapa back and forth, tossing him around in the sky until he landed heavily on his back in the forest. Unfortunately for the cunning tortoise, the only thing to cushion his fall was a big rock that was sitting on the forest floor. When he landed on the rock, Ijapa’s shell cracked in so many places that it ended up looking like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nThe tortoise awoke many hours later. He was very dazed, but he was able to move and found that he was not in very much pain after all. But his shell remained like a jigsaw puzzle and would never again return to the lovely, smooth, round shape it was before."

      "body": "The Monkey makes a new friend:\n\n“Come outside and play,” said Manish the monkey tugging on Manav’s tail. “It’s boring watching you on the internet all day long.” “Go away,” said Manav as he carried on typing.\n\n “I’m chatting online. You can play outside if you want to”. Manish peered over his older brother’s shoulder. “You know you’re not supposed to be in these internet cafes. Mum will go mad if she catches you!” “Only if you tell her,” retorted Manav. “Go away and play your stupid games.”\n\n Manish scampered away with his tail between his legs and his head hanging. He hated it when Manav was mean to him. It was horrid being the littlest brother. He wanted Manav to notice him. Manish ran out of the internet cafe and along the street. He ran past the food seller serving up hot spicy curry. He ran past the stalls of women in the market selling brightly patterned cloth. He ran past the men working at the garage fixing the cars and mopeds. He ran past the furniture shops selling hand-made wooden beds and tables and chairs. Manish ran and ran and ran to his favourite place, a small grove of trees on the outskirts of the town. This was where the rainforest began. \n\nManish climbed and climbed and climbed to the top of his favourite Jackfruit tree. From the highest branch of the tallest tree Manish could see for miles. He could see across the town, where people were going about their business. People driving, people walking, people working, children flying their kites and playing outside. Manish could see across the fields, he could see across the forest, where the brightly coloured birds were nesting. Deep inside the rainforest Manish could see the tigers roaming. They loved to bask in the warm early evening sun. The cubs were chasing each other whilst their mother looked on, keeping a watchful eye. Manish climbed down and down and down from the top of his favourite tree. Then he ran and ran and ran deep into the rainforest. After school the next day Manish waited for Manav outside the school gates. “I’m going to play football. \n\nAre you coming?” “Not now Manish, I have things to do” said Manav and he hurried off to the internet cafe. Manav loved the internet. There was so much information there. You could find out anything you wanted. You could find out how far away the moon is. You could find out how deep the oceans are. You could chat to your friends online. He knew his mother was worried about him visiting internet chatrooms but he liked to chat to new people there. He couldn’t understand what all the fuss was about. Manav logged in to his favourite website, Monkey Mania. Ping! A bright blue box popped up. He had a message! “Hello!” it said. “Hello!” Manav typed back. “I’m Manav. What’s your name?”\n\n “My name is Aabha” said the message. A picture appeared. Aabha was beautiful. She was smiling and she looked like so much fun. Manav and Aabha chatted online for ages. Aabha said they were the same age. They chatted about what they were doing at school. They chatted about sport. They chatted about television. Manav was so happy. “Would you like to meet up?” asked Aabha. Manav was so excited about making a new friend. “I would love to!” he said. And so they arranged to meet the very next day after school. Friday’s maths lesson seemed to take forever. Manav was looking at his watch. He couldn’t wait for school to finish. He had arranged to meet Aabha. Finally the school bell rang and Manav grabbed his bag and ran. As he reached the school gate he saw Manish. \n\n“Manav!” shouted Manish. “No time!” said Manav and he ran past the school gates. Manav ran down the street. He ran past the food seller serving up hot spicy curry. He ran past the stalls of women in the market selling brightly patterned cloth. He ran past the men working at the garage fixing the cars and mopeds. He ran past the furniture shops selling hand-made wooden beds and tables and chairs. Manav ran and ran and ran until he reached the edge of the rain forest. He paused for a moment. He had never been further than this on his own. Then he carried on running. The forest grew thicker. The forest grew darker. Manav was not sure where he was going. All he knew was that he going to meet Aabha. After what seemed like forever Manav found a clearing in the wood, just like the one Aabha had described.\n\n Manav sat himself down on a rock to wait. The sounds of the forest were all around him. He could hear the mynah birds singing, calling out to each other and he could hear the crickets chirruping. But he could also hear something else. It was some kind of rustling. “Aabha,” he called out. “Is that you?” There was no reply. “Hello?” he shouted, looking around. There it was again. This time it was louder. “Hello!” he cried out. “Who is it?” Manav was starting to panic now. The noise was growing louder still. Now he could hear something that sounded like a low growling. It seemed to surround him. It seemed to be getting louder. Rustling and growling. Growling and rustling. “Aabha, Aabha where are you?” Manav asked. He was beginning to wish he had never come here. He was beginning to wish he was playing football with his brother, or at home with his mum. Suddenly there was a sound louder than Manav had ever heard before. A loud, loud roar. Suddenly, there, right before him was a tiger. Manav turned to run – but there was another one, and another one. \n\nA whole pack of tigers surrounded him. They stood in a circle around him. “Who are you?” cried out Manav. “What do you want?” The tigers began to close in on Manav. He looked around, this way and that, searching for an escape route but there was none. Manav whimpered and huddled into the rock. The tigers prowled around him hungrily. Then, one stepped forward and leant forward “Manav.” The tiger said in a low voice. “Why are you here?” Manav looked up. “Are you looking for Aabha?” The tiger asked. “What have you done with her?” Manish whimpered. “Manav,” the tiger said gently. “I am Aabha.” “But…we were chatting online!” said Manav, looking confused. “She sent me her picture” he said pulling out a picture of the young, smiling money. “And what made you believe that this was Aabha?” the tiger asked. “I…I don’t know. \n\nShe told me so much about herself and we arranged to meet here” Manav said. “Manav, you are young and naïve. You must understand that you cannot believe everything you see on the internet. You cannot trust everybody you meet online. Some people may wish to harm you” and with that the tiger let out a fearsome roar which echoed through the rainforest. The roar was so loud it could be heard by the food seller serving up hot spicy curry. It could be heard by the women in the market selling brightly patterned cloth. It could be heard by the men working at the garage fixing the cars and mopeds. \n\nIt could be heard by people at the furniture shops selling hand-made wooden beds and tables and chairs. It could be heard by Manish and Manav’s mother who was at home making their dinner. The tiger raised up a huge paw and Manav cringed and closed his eyes. The tiger rested his paw on the young monkey’s shoulder. “Manav,” the tiger said, her eyes full of wisdom and kindness “Go home to you family and friends. Warn people to beware – that online you cannot always be sure who you are speaking to.” Manav opened his eyes and as he did so he saw the tiger pack part. \n\nHe could see a small figure running between them. It was his brother! “Manish!” he said embracing him. “What are you doing here?” “I’m sorry Manav,” said the littlest brother. “I wanted you to see what a risk you were taking and so I asked the tigers to help teach you a lesson.” “Come on,” said Manav “Let’s go home for dinner. And then we can go outside and play.” With that the two brothers scampered out of the clearing and headed for home."

      "body": "The Golden Ball:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived two lasses, who were sisters, and as they came from the fair they saw a right handsome young man standing at a house door before them. They had never seen such a handsome young man before. He had gold on his cap, gold on his finger, gold on his neck, gold at his waist! And he had a golden ball in each hand. He gave a ball to each lass, saying she was to keep it ; but if she lost it, she was to be hanged.\n\nNow the youngest of the lasses lost her ball, and this is how. She was by a park paling, and she was tossing her ball, and it went up, and up, and up, till it went fair over the paling ; and when she climbed to look for it, the ball ran along the green grass, and it ran right forward to the door of a house that stood there, and the ball went into the house and she saw it no more.\n\nSo she was taken away to be hanged by the neck till she was dead, because she had lost her ball.\n\nBut the lass had a sweetheart, and he said he would go and get the ball. So he went to the park gate, but 'twas shut ; then he climbed the railing, and when he got to the top of it an old woman rose up out of the ditch before him and said that if he wanted to get the ball he must sleep three nights in the house: so he said he would.\n\nWell! when it was evening, he went into the house, and looked everywhere for the ball, but he could not find it, nor any one in the house at all ; but when night came on he thought he heard bogles moving about in the courtyard ; so he looked out o' window, and, sure enough, the yard was full of them!\n\nPresently he heard steps coming upstairs, so he hid behind the door, and was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant five times as tall as the lad, and looked around ; but seeing nothing he went to the window and bowed himself to look out ; and as he bowed on his elbows to see the bogles in the yard, the lad stepped behind him, and with one blow of his sword he cut him in twain, so that the top part of him fell into the yard, and the bottom part remained standing looking out of the window.\n\nWell! there was a great cry from the bogles when they saw half the giant come tumbling down to them, and they called out, \"There comes half our master; give us the other half.\"\n\nThen the lad said, \" It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs, standing alone at the window, as thou hast no eye to see with, so go join thy brother \"; and he cast the lower part of the giant after the top part. Now when the bogles had gotten all the giant they were quiet.\n\nNext night the lad went to sleep in the house again, and this time a second giant came in at the door, and as he came in the lad cut him in twain ; but the legs walked on to the fire and went straight up the chimney.\n\n\"Go, get thee after thy legs,\" said the lad to the head, and he cast the other half of the giant up the chimney.\n\nNow the third night nothing happened, so the lad got into bed ; but before he went to sleep he heard the bogles striving under the bed, and he wondered what they were at. So he peeped, and saw that they had the ball there, and were playing with it, casting it to and fro.\n\nNow after a time one of them thrust his leg out from under the bed, and quick as anything the lad brings his sword down, and cuts it off. Then another bogle thrust his arm out at t'other side of the bed, and in a twinkling the lad cuts that off too. So it went on, till at last he had maimed them all, and they all went off, crying and wailing, and forgot the ball! Then the lad got out of bed, found the ball, and went off at once to seek his true love.\n\nNow the lass had been taken to York to be hanged ; she was brought out on the scaffold, and the hangman said, \" Now, lass, thou must hang by the neck till thou be'st dead.\" But she cried out:\n\n\"Stop, stop, I think I see my mother coming! O mother, hast thou brought my golden ball And come to set me free? \"\n\nAnd the mother answered:\n\n\"I've neither brought thy golden ball\n\nNor come to set thee free. But I have come to see thee hung\n\nUpon this gallows-tree.\"\n\nThen the hangman said, \"Now, lass, say thy prayers for thou must die.\" But she said:\n\n\"Stop, stop, I think I see my father coming! O father, hast thou brought my golden ball And come to set me free? \"\n\nAnd the father answered:\n\n\"I've neither brought thy golden ball nor come to set thee free. But I have come to see thee hung upon this gallows-tree.\"\n\nThen the hangman said, \"Hast thee done thy prayers? Now, lass, put thy head into the noose.\"\n\nBut she answered, \"Stop, stop, I think I see my brother coming! \" And again she sang her little verse, and the brother sang back the same words. And so with her sister, her uncle, her aunt, and her cousin. But they all said the same:\n\n\"I've neither brought thy golden ball nor come to set thee free. But I have come to see thee hung Upon this gallows-tree.\"\n\nThen the hangman said, \"I will stop no longer, thou'rt making game of me. Thou must be hung at once.\"\n\nBut now, at long last, she saw her sweetheart coming through the crowd, so she cried to him:\n\n\"Stop, stop, I see my sweetheart coming! Sweetheart, hast thou brought my golden ball And come to set me free? \"\n\nThen her sweetheart held up her golden ball and cried:\n\n\"Aye, I have brought to thee thy golden ball and come to set thee free ; I have not come to see thee hung upon this gallows-tree.\"\n\nSo he took her home, then and there, and they lived happy ever after."

He barely managed to get a living by the sale of soap.\n\nAll day long, from sunrise to sunset, he tramped the city, crying out: \"O brothers, buy my pure soap. There is none better in the city, as every one knows. Even the little babes would say so if they could but speak.\"\n\nStill, if you looked closely at it, you would never guess it to be soap; it was black and coarse, and more like wood than anything else. If any unlucky pilgrim used it on his face or hands, it would make his skin burn like fire. But this did not often happen, for the people in Persia do not use much soap on themselves, or their clothes, and sand does very well for cleaning cooking pots and pans. So it was that there were many days when poor Abdullah did not sell enough to buy sufficient bread for himself and his little boy Ahmed.\n\nAt such times, the father would creep sadly into his wretched mud-built hovel, and bury his face in his hands, so that he might not see his son trying to keep back the tears caused by hunger. The little fellow, however, now ten years of age, would comfort his father by saying:\n\n\"Inshallah\"--if God wills--\"to-morrow you will sell more soap than you have done for weeks past.\" And the father, looking into the bright, open face of his boy, would take courage, and pray that this might be so.\n\nBut the days went on and things became blacker and blacker, when one day an adventure befell little Ahmed. He was on his way to school, and as the sun was very hot, he sought the shelter of the big plane-trees that lined the banks of the stream flowing down the center of the principal street.\n\nWomen were filling their water jugs, or washing clothes; a string of camels were drinking; several donkeys were rolling playfully over and over in the water, and some dyers were wringing out newly-dyed garments, causing waves of many colors to flow past.\n\nJust as Ahmed had stopped to look, a dervish, leading a fine lion by a chain, and some runners with curious hats and coats rushed past, shouting:\n\n\"Make way for the King! Turn your faces to the wall!\" And there was the great King, seated on a beautiful Arabian horse, surrounded by soldiers. Then there passed a palanquin borne on the backs of four mules.\n\nThe party stopped just opposite to Ahmed, and from the palanquin there alighted a lady closely veiled, evidently wishing to inspect some beautiful Meshed silver work. Before she could reach the shop, a great tumult arose among the people. The lion had broken his chain and was madly leaping here and there, tearing and rending and dashing people to the ground. Women fainted, men fled, little children stood still and cried pitifully, some jumped into the stream; the frightened horses dashed madly through the crowd. All was terror and confusion.\n\nThen with a roar the lion sprang upon the princess, and bore her to the ground; but ere he could tear her to pieces, Ahmed had sprang forward, seized a piece of iron, one end of which was red hot, from the shop of a blacksmith, and thrust it furiously into the face of the lion. With a cry of pain and rage the lion left the princess and bounded off to the bazaars, where he did great damage.\n\nAs soon as the princess had recovered from her fright, she beckoned to Ahmed to come near, and removing her veil, told him he was a brave little fellow, and ordered one of her servants to give him a purse of gold. Ahmed had never seen anyone so beautiful, and was so lost in wonder, that before he could find words of thanks, the party had passed on.\n\nBut when the money was spent, Ahmed and his father began to be in want again. A Jewish pedlar having told him how much better trade was in the capital, they determined to set forth to that city, though the way was long and full of danger. \"Better to die in the desert, than in the heart of a great city,\" said Ahmed.\n\nSo they set forth on their journey, sometimes climbing up winding paths among the mountains, at other times traversing the desert, footsore, and weary almost to death, often hungry and thirsty, tormented by the thought that they would fall into the hands of the man-stealing robbers who haunted this great pilgrim road.\n\nOn account of the intense heat and the cruel robbers, they traveled by night. In every shadow cast by the moon upon the ground, they thought they saw a robber on his big horse. During the day they slept at wayside inns, and in return for little services rendered by Ahmed to the muleteers, they would give him a handful of rice or bread, or a few dried fruits which kept them from starvation.\n\nSo it went on until one night, when searching for the bridge that crosses the Salt River, the sky became suddenly overcast, the rain fell in torrents, and soon the river was in flood. There was nothing to be done but to sit down and wait until the moon should rise. The fierce wind buffeted them, the rain drenched them; they had lost their way, and were at the mercy of wild beasts.\n\nOnce, when the wind dropped for a little, out of the darkness came a groan. \"Keep still as death, my son,\" said the father to Ahmed, \"for it is the Old Man of the Desert.\"\n\nNow Ahmed had never before heard of the Old Man of the Desert, and therefore knew no fear, so despite his father's warning, he got up and went in the direction from whence came the groans. As he reached the spot, the moon came out from behind a bank of clouds, and Ahmed saw a poor dervish lying on the sand. He had a leopard skin thrown over his shoulders; by his side lay a big stick studded with sharp nails, and a basin made of the outer skin of a pumpkin in which he collected alms.\n\n\"For the sake of the Prophet,\" he moaned when he saw Ahmed, \"give me a drink of water.\" And Ahmed, filling his pitcher from the river gave him to drink, though the water was somewhat salty.\n\nThe water revived the dervish, and he said: \"I am Ali, the dervish, and am known throughout Persia. Two months ago I left Mazandaran to go to Meshed. But yesterday the fever seized me. This is the third attack, and, as you know, it is always fatal.\n\n\"Stay with me, my son, in this dark hour when I shall pass through the valley of the shadow of death. And when my soul shall have crossed the Bridge of Death, take this little leather bag hanging round my neck, and therein you shall find a tiny cup, cut from a crystal, which if used rightly, shall lift thee to great power and wealth.\n\n\"Each morning when you rise, place a drop of pure water in the cup, and look intently therein, and should any danger threaten you or those near and dear to you, it will be made manifest. And if--\" but here his strength failed him, his head fell back, and he passed away. Ahmed found the bag and the beautifully cut crystal, just as the dervish had said, and returning to his father, told him all that had happened.\n\nAhmed did as the dervish had directed him for several mornings, but seeing nothing in the crystal, he dropped the practice. There came a day, however, when they were overtaken by a dreadful dust storm. From across the wide stretch of sand, the wind raged, the sky and sun were blotted out, the air was laden with dust, and the small pebbles and stones carried in the wind cut them until they cried with pain. Shelter there was none.\n\nIn fear and pain they ran here and there, and when after several hours of misery, the storm had passed, they could not see each other. They were lost in the cruel desert, with no food, and worse still, no water. Sobbing in despair, Ahmed straggled on. He went like one in a dream. Time after time he fell tripping over rocks and bushes, but he pressed onward. Then came a time when he could go no further, and he lay down to die.\n\nFor a long time he slept, and then he was awakened by being shaken. Looking up, he saw an old man smiling and saying: \"Why, it's little Ahmed, the son of Abdullah, the Soap Seller. Don't you know me, Ahmed? I am your uncle. Don't cry because you have lost your way. Come, take my hand and we will soon find your father.\"\n\nNow Ahmed wondered why he had never seen or even heard his father speak of this particular uncle, but he took the old man's hand, and together they set forth. Mile after mile they went, but no trace of his father could be found. Then he sat down crying, and said: \"I am so tired, I can go no further.\" And the old man replied: \"Sleep, my son, while I keep watch.\"\n\nBut just as Ahmed was closing his eyes, the old man turned, and Ahmed saw that he had thin legs like those of a sheep. \"The Ghool! the Ghool!\" he shrieked, and fainted. Then this wicked ogre of the desert began to open Ahmed's coat in order to suck his blood.\n\nBut another cry answered that of the boy, and then appeared on the scene a beautiful young woman, carrying in her harid a necklace of gold and silver beads. Casting but one glance at the beads, the old man flew swifter than the wild sheep of the mountains, for the sight of metal rendered him powerless to do harm.\n\nOf course, it was the princess whose life Ahmed had saved in Meshed. The King, her father, happened to be returning from a pilgrimage, and to give a fright to her servants, she had scampered off the track, and thus had found Ahmed. At her request, Ahmed became one of the King's followers, and together with his father, whom they found the next day, they journeyed to the capital.\n\nSome three days' march from the capital, in the mountains near Kazveen, there lived the Old Man of the Mountains, or as he is generally known, the King of the Assassins, with his followers. So great was his power that he had but to say the word and any of his men would throw themselves from the topmost crags to the valleys beneath and be dashed to pieces, or at his bidding, they would travel forth to the most distant parts of the world in order to kill any persons, however great they might be.\n\nWhen he heard that the King of Persia was collecting an army to destroy both him and his tribe, he became very angry, and said to one of his followers: \"Go, rid me of the King of Persia;\" and the mart-took bread and water and a sharp dagger, and went.\n\nNow after his narrow escape from the Old Man of the Desert, Ahmed took pains every morning to place a drop of water in the crystal cup and look therein. Nothing appeared until one morning he saw in the bead of water a vision of the King asleep, and standing by him a robber with an uplifted dagger, about to strike. Hurrying to the King's presence, he warned him of the danger, but the King only laughed, for he trusted his guards.\n\nNevertheless, Ahmed determined to keep watch. Darkness came, and the guards slept. The palace was silent. The hours slipped by, and Ahmed, weary with much waiting was about to retire, when he perceived a dark shadow creeping into that part of the palace where the King slept.\n\nThe figure noiselessly made its way to the very threshold of the King's room, when Ahmed sprang upon it, at the same time giving the alarm. The whole palace was aroused and the murdered secured.\n\nWhen the messenger did not return, the Old Man of the Mountains sent a second, and then a third, and finally the most daring and skilful of all his followers; but thanks to Ahmed's crystal cup, all attempts upon the life of the King failed.\n\nThen the King sent for Ahmed, and said: \"Ask for anything in reason, and it shall be given thee.\" And though he was trembling in every limb, Ahmed replied: \"Neither wealth nor power does thy slave desire, save the hand of thy daughter.\"\n\n\"If she loves you, it shall be so,\" replied the King, and she did love him; they were married, and Ahmed became the King's Prime Minister."

      "body": "Iron Hans:\n\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps some accident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.’ The huntsman replied: ‘Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.’\n\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety.\n\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till you have opened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’ said the boy, ‘I will not do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ‘Open my door,’ but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said: ‘I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild man said: ‘It lies under your mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’ The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!’ The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.\n\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy down from his shoulder, and said to him: ‘You will never see your father and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free, and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the world.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the next morning the man took him to a well, and said: ‘Behold, the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.’ The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in. As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said: ‘What has happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing nothing,’ he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. But he said: ‘You have dipped your finger into the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let anything go in.’ By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew what had happened. ‘You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he. ‘I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me.’\n\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger, however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket- handkerchief and tied it round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he already knew everything, and said: ‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. ‘You have not stood the trial and can stay here no longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is. But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the forest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then I will come and help you. My power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.’\n\nThen the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under the king’s notice, and he said: ‘When you come to the royal table you must take your hat off.’ He answered: ‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad sore place on my head.’ Then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however, had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.\n\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s daughter, and up she sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to him: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put his cap on with all haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ‘How can you take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh, no,’ replied the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please her better.’ When he got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again said: ‘I may not, I have a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the gardener, and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play with them.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it, she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him, but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money.\n\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army. Then said the gardener’s boy: ‘I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’ three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said: ‘What do you desire?’ ‘I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.’ ‘That you shall have, and still more than you ask for.’ Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked the wild man. ‘Take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory. ‘I am not the one who carried away the victory,’ said he, ‘but a strange knight who came to my assistance with his soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did not see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but he smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three- legged horse, and the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our hobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more ridiculed.’\n\nThe king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the youth went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked he. ‘That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden apple.’ ‘It is as safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ‘You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king’s daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\n\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew angry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\n\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off with it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\n\nThe following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his boy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise shown my children three golden apples which he has won.’\n\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and he was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you the knight who came every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught the three golden apples?’ asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘and here the apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them to the king. ‘If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight who helped you to your victory over your enemies.’ ‘If you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is your father?’ ‘My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great as I require.’ ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to you; can I do anything to please you?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed you can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The maiden laughed, and said: ‘He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’ and then she went and kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ‘I am Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free; all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.’"

      "body": "The Horse And The Lion:\n\nLong ago, there was a farmer who had an old horse with him. As the horse had become old, the farmer told the horse to leave his house and live in some forest. The horse became very sad. He said to his master, \"Master, I'm your old servant. I have served you all my life. I have always been faithful to you and there has been no slackness on my part in carrying out my duties. So long as I was physically strong, you had all your affections for me but as soon as you realised that I have become physically infirm; I, no longer, have that vigour and vitality in me, you asked me to leave your house and go and live in some forest. Is this a reward to the services rendered by me with all my honesty and faithfulness?\"\n\nThe farmer was at a loss of words. He had no logical answer.\n\n\"All right!\" the farmer said to the horse. \"You can stay in my house provided you bring me a lion. I want a lion's skin.\"\n\nSo the worried horse set out for the forest. There he met a fox. The fox took pity on the horse and enquired from him the reason of his sadness. The horse narrated the whole story.\n\nThe fox being good natured offered to help the horse. He said to the horse. \"You lie down here on the ground as if you were dead.\"\n\nThe horse followed the advice of the fox and lay there on the ground as if he were dead.\n\nThen the fox met king lion and said \"Your Majesty, there is a dead horse lying in an open field. It's better you come and see for yourself.\"\n\nWhen the fox and the lion reached the spot, where the horse was lying pretending to be dead, the fox said, \"Let us pull this horse and put it behind the bushes so that we could have a peaceful meal. What I'll do is that I'll tie your tail to the tail of the horse.\"\n\n\"Yes, I agree with you,\" said the lion.\n\nSo the fox, instead of tying lion's tail to that of the horse, tied the horse's tail with the leg of the lion. Then he asked the horse to get up and run fast.\n\nThe horse, at once got up and started running as fast as he could.\n\nAll this happened so suddenly that the lion didn't get a chance to balance himself. The horse was running so fast that he was literally being dragged like a dead animal. His body slammed against big rocks so many times and was caught by thorny bushes in the way. He was getting injuries after injuries and was bleeding profusely.\n\nThe lion began to cry and threaten, but the horse didn't stop. At last, the lion couldn't take any more of it and succumbed to injuries.\n\nThe horse stopped at his master's house with the dead lion tied to its tail. The farmer was very happy to see the dead lion. He permitted the horse to stay at his house as long as he wished.\n\nMoral: Mind is mightier than body."

      "body": "The Mirror Of Matsuyama: Japanese Story:\n\nLong years ago in old Japan there lived in the Province of Echigo, a very remote part of Japan even in these days, a man and his wife. When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter. She was the joy and pride of both their lives, and in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.\n\nWhat golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood; the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old, her proud mother carrying her, robed in ceremonial kimono, to be put under the patronage of the family's household god; then her first dolls festival, when her parents gave her a set of dolls' and their miniature belongings, to be added to as year succeeded year; and perhaps the most important occasion of all, on her third birthday, when her first OBI (broad brocade sash) of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist, a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind. Now that she was seven years of age, and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents, their cup of happiness seemed full. There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family.\n\nOne day there was much excitement in the home, for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business. In these days of railways and jinrickshas and other rapid modes of traveling, it is difficult to realize what such a journey as that from Matsuyama to Kyoto meant. The roads were rough and bad, and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way, whether the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles. Indeed, in those days it was as great an undertaking to go up to the capital as it is for a Japanese to make a voyage to Europe now.\n\nSo the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey, knowing what an arduous task lay before him. Vainly she wished that she could accompany him, but the distance was too great for the mother and child to go, and besides that, it was the wife's duty to take care of the home.\n\nAll was ready at last, and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him.\n\n\"Do not be anxious, I will come back soon,\" said the man. \"While I am away take care of everything, and especially of our little daughter.\"\n\n\"Yes, we shall be all right--but you--you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us,\" said the wife, while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.\n\nThe little girl was the only one to smile, for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting, and did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village, which her father did very often. She ran to his side, and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment.\n\n\"Father, I will be very good while I am waiting for you to come back, so please bring me a present.\"\n\nAs the father turned to take a last look at his weeping wife and smiling, eager child, he felt as if some one were pulling him back by the hair, so hard was it for him to leave them behind, for they had never been separated before. But he knew that he must go, for the call was imperative. With a great effort he ceased to think, and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the little garden and out through the gate. His wife, catching up the child in her arms, ran as far as the gate, and watched him as he went down the road between the pines till he was lost in the haze of the distance and all she could see was his quaint peaked hat, and at last that vanished too.\n\n\"Now father has gone, you and I must take care of everything till he comes back,\" said the mother, as she made her way back to the house.\n\n\"Yes, I will be very good,\" said the child, nodding her head, \"and when father comes home please tell him how good I have been, and then perhaps he will give me a present.\"\n\n\"Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much. I know, for I asked him to bring you a doll. You must think of father every day, and pray for a safe journey till he comes back.\"\n\n\"O, yes, when he comes home again how happy I shall be,\" said the child, clapping her hands, and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought. It seemed to the mother as she looked at the child's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper.\n\nThen she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them. She set up her simple wooden spinning-wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs. In the intervals of her work she directed the little girl's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country. Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband's absence. While the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home, the husband finished his business and returned.\n\nIt would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him. He had traveled day after day, exposed to all weathers, for about a month altogether, and was sunburnt to bronze, but his fond wife and child knew him at a glance, and flew to meet him from either side, each catching hold of one of his sleeves in their eager greeting. Both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well. It seemed a very long time to all till--the mother and child helping--his straw sandals were untied, his large umbrella hat taken off, and he was again in their midst in the old familiar sitting-room that had been so empty while he was away.\n\nAs soon as they had sat down on the white mats, the father opened a bamboo basket that he had brought in with him, and took out a beautiful doll and a lacquer box full of cakes.\n\n\"Here,\" he said to the little girl, \"is a present for you. It is a prize for taking care of mother and the house so well while I was away.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the child, as she bowed her head to the ground, and then put out her hand just like a little maple leaf with its eager wide-spread fingers to take the doll and the box, both of which, coming from the capital, were prettier than anything she had ever seen. No words can tell how delighted the little girl was--her face seemed as if it would melt with joy, and she had no eyes and no thought for anything else.\n\nAgain the husband dived into the basket, and brought out this time a square wooden box, carefully tied up with red and white string, and handing it to his wife, said:\n\n\"And this is for you.\"\n\nThe wife took the box, and opening it carefully took out a metal disk with a handle attached. One side was bright and shining like a crystal, and the other was covered with raised figures of pine-trees and storks, which had been carved out of its smooth surface in lifelike reality. Never had she seen such a thing in her life, for she had been born and bred in the rural province of Echigo. She gazed into the shining disk, and looking up with surprise and wonder pictured on her face, she said:\n\n\"I see somebody looking at me in this round thing! What is it that you have given me?\"\n\nThe husband laughed and said:\n\n\"Why, it is your own face that you see. What I have brought you is called a mirror, and whoever looks into its clear surface can see their own form reflected there. Although there are none to be found in this out of the way place, yet they have been in use in the capital from the most ancient times. There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to possess. There is an old proverb that 'As the sword is the soul of a samurai, so is the mirror the soul of a woman,' and according to popular tradition, a woman's mirror is an index to her own heart--if she keeps it bright and clear, so is her heart pure and good. It is also one of the treasures that form the insignia of the Emperor. So you must lay great store by your mirror, and use it carefully.\"\n\nThe wife listened to all her husband told her, and was pleased at learning so much that was new to her. She was still more pleased at the precious gift--his token of remembrance while he had been away.\n\n\"If the mirror represents my soul, I shall certainly treasure it as a valuable possession, and never will I use it carelessly.\" Saying so, she lifted it as high as her forehead, in grateful acknowledgment of the gift, and then shut it up in its box and put it away.\n\nThe wife saw that her husband was very tired, and set about serving the evening meal and making everything as comfortable as she could for him. It seemed to the little family as if they had not known what true happiness was before, so glad were they to be together again, and this evening the father had much to tell of his journey and of all he had seen at the great capital.\n\nTime passed away in the peaceful home, and the parents saw their fondest hopes realized as their daughter grew from childhood into a beautiful girl of sixteen. As a gem of priceless value is held in its proud owner's hand, so had they reared her with unceasing love and care: and now their pains were more than doubly rewarded. What a comfort she was to her mother as she went about the house taking her part in the housekeeping, and how proud her father was of her, for she daily reminded him of her mother when he had first married her.\n\nBut, alas! in this world nothing lasts forever. Even the moon is not always perfect in shape, but loses its roundness with time, and flowers bloom and then fade. So at last the happiness of this family was broken up by a great sorrow. The good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill.\n\nIn the first days of her illness the father and daughter thought that it was only a cold, and were not particularly anxious. But the days went by and still the mother did not get better; she only grew worse, and the doctor was puzzled, for in spite of all he did the poor woman grew weaker day by day. The father and daughter were stricken with grief, and day or night the girl never left her mother's side. But in spite of all their efforts the woman's life was not to be saved.\n\nOne day as the girl sat near her mother's bed, trying to hide with a cheery smile the gnawing trouble at her heart, the mother roused herself and taking her daughter's hand, gazed earnestly and lovingly into her eyes. Her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty:\n\n\"My daughter. I am sure that nothing can save me now. When I am dead, promise me to take care of your dear father and to try to be a good and dutiful woman.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother,\" said the girl as the tears rushed to her eyes, \"you must not say such things. All you have to do is to make haste and get well--that will bring the greatest happiness to father and myself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, and it is a comfort to me in my last days to know how greatly you long for me to get better, but it is not to be. Do not look so sorrowful, for it was so ordained in my previous state of existence that I should die in this life just at this time; knowing this, I am quite resigned to my fate. And now I have something to give you whereby to remember me when I am gone.\"\n\nPutting her hand out, she took from the side of the pillow a square wooden box tied up with a silken cord and tassels. Undoing this very carefully, she took out of the box the mirror that her husband had given her years ago.\n\n\"When you were still a little child your father went up to the capital and brought me back as a present this treasure; it is called a mirror. This I give you before I die. If, after I have ceased to be in this life, you are lonely and long to see me sometimes, then take out this mirror and in the clear and shining surface you will always see me--so will you be able to meet with me often and tell me all your heart; and though I shall not be able to speak, I shall understand and sympathize with you, whatever may happen to you in the future.\" With these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.\n\nThe mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest, and sinking back without another word her spirit passed quietly away that day.\n\nThe bereaved father and daughter were wild with grief, and they abandoned themselves to their bitter sorrow. They felt it to be impossible to take leave of the loved woman who till now had filled their whole lives and to commit her body to the earth. But this frantic burst of grief passed, and then they took possession of their own hearts again, crushed though they were in resignation. In spite of this the daughter's life seemed to her desolate. Her love for her dead mother did not grow less with time, and so keen was her remembrance, that everything in daily life, even the falling of the rain and the blowing of the wind, reminded her of her mother's death and of all that they had loved and shared together. \n\nOne day when her father was out, and she was fulfilling her household duties alone, her loneliness and sorrow seemed more than she could bear. She threw herself down in her mother's room and wept as if her heart would break. Poor child, she longed just for one glimpse of the loved face, one sound of the voice calling her pet name, or for one moment's forgetfulness of the aching void in her heart. Suddenly she sat up. Her mother's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief.\n\n\"Oh! my mother told me when she gave me the mirror as a parting gift, that whenever I looked into it I should be able to meet her--to see her. I had nearly forgotten her last words--how stupid I am; I will get the mirror now and see if it can possibly be true!\"\n\nShe dried her eyes quickly, and going to the cupboard took out the box that contained the mirror, her heart beating with expectation as she lifted the mirror out and gazed into its smooth face. Behold, her mother's words were true! In the round mirror before her she saw her mother's face; but, oh, the joyful surprise! It was not her mother thin and wasted by illness, but the young and beautiful woman as she remembered her far back in the days of her own earliest childhood. It seemed to the girl that the face in the mirror must soon speak, almost that she heard the voice of her mother telling her again to grow up a good woman and a dutiful daughter, so earnestly did the eyes in the mirror look back into her own.\n\n\"It is certainly my mother's soul that I see. She knows how miserable I am without her and she has come to comfort me. Whenever I long to see her she will meet me here; how grateful I ought to be!\"\n\nAnd from this time the weight of sorrow was greatly lightened for her young heart. Every morning, to gather strength for the day's duties before her, and every evening, for consolation before she lay down to rest, did the young girl take out the mirror and gaze at the reflection which in the simplicity of her innocent heart she believed to be her mother's soul. Daily she grew in the likeness of her dead mother's character, and was gentle and kind to all, and a dutiful daughter to her father.\n\nA year spent in mourning had thus passed away in the little household, when, by the advice of his relations, the man married again, and the daughter now found herself under the authority of a step-mother. It was a trying position; but her days spent in the recollection of her own beloved mother, and of trying to be what that mother would wish her to be, had made the young girl docile and patient, and she now determined to be filial and dutiful to her father's wife, in all respects. Everything went on apparently smoothly in the family for some time under the new regime; there were no winds or waves of discord to ruffle the surface of every-day life, and the father was content.\n\nBut it is a woman's danger to be petty and mean, and step-mothers are proverbial all the world over, and this one's heart was not as her first smiles were. As the days and weeks grew into months, the step-mother began to treat the motherless girl unkindly and to try and come between the father and child.\n\nSometimes she went to her husband and complained of her step-daughter's behavior, but the father knowing that this was to be expected, took no notice of her ill-natured complaints. Instead of lessening his affection for his daughter, as the woman desired, her grumblings only made him think of her the more. The woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely child than before. This did not please her at all, and she began to turn over in her mind how she could, by some means or other, drive her step-child out of the house. So crooked did the woman's heart become.\n\nShe watched the girl carefully, and one day peeping into her room in the early morning, she thought she discovered a grave enough sin of which to accuse the child to her father. The woman herself was a little frightened too at what she had seen.\n\nSo she went at once to her husband, and wiping away some false tears she said in a sad voice:\n\n\"Please give me permission to leave you today.\"\n\nThe man was completely taken by surprise at the suddenness of her request, and wondered whatever was the matter.\n\n\"Do you find it so disagreeable,\" he asked, \"in my house, that you can stay no longer?\"\n\n\"No! no! it has nothing to do with you--even in my dreams I have never thought that I wished to leave your side; but if I go on living here I am in danger of losing my life, so I think it best for all concerned that you should allow me to go home!\"\n\nAnd the woman began to weep afresh. Her husband, distressed to see her so unhappy, and thinking that he could not have heard aright, said:\n\n\"Tell me what you mean! How is your life in danger here?\"\n\n\"I will tell you since you ask me. Your daughter dislikes me as her step-mother. For some time past she has shut herself up in her room morning and evening, and looking in as I pass by, I am convinced that she has made an image of me and is trying to kill me by magic art, cursing me daily. It is not safe for me to stay here, such being the case; indeed, indeed, I must go away, we cannot live under the same roof any more.\"\n\nThe husband listened to the dreadful tale, but he could not believe his gentle daughter guilty of such an evil act. He knew that by popular superstition people believed that one person could cause the gradual death of another by making an image of the hated one and cursing it daily; but where had his young daughter learned such knowledge?--the thing was impossible. Yet he remembered having noticed that his daughter stayed much in her room of late and kept herself away from every one, even when visitors came to the house. Putting this fact together with his wife's alarm, he thought that there might be something to account for the strange story.\n\nHis heart was torn between doubting his wife and trusting his child, and he knew not what to do. He decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth. Comforting his wife and assuring her that her fears were groundless, he glided quietly to his daughter's room.\n\nThe girl had for a long time past been very unhappy. She had tried by amiability and obedience to show her goodwill and to mollify the new wife, and to break down that wall of prejudice and misunderstanding that she knew generally stood between step-parents and their step-children. But she soon found that her efforts were in vain.\n\n The step-mother never trusted her, and seemed to misinterpret all her actions, and the poor child knew very well that she often carried unkind and untrue tales to her father. She could not help comparing her present unhappy condition with the time when her own mother was alive only a little more than a year ago--so great a change in this short time! Morning and evening she wept over the remembrance. Whenever she could she went to her room, and sliding the screens to, took out the mirror and gazed, as she thought, at her mother's face. It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.\n\nHer father found her occupied in this way. Pushing aside the fusama, he saw her bending over something or other very intently. Looking over her shoulder, to see who was entering her room, the girl was surprised to see her father, for he generally sent for her when he wished to speak to her. She was also confused at being found looking at the mirror, for she had never told any one of her mother's last promise, but had kept it as the sacred secret of her heart. So before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve. Her father noting her confusion, and her act of hiding something, said in a severe manner:\n\n\"Daughter, what are you doing here? And what is that that you have hidden in your sleeve?\"\n\nThe girl was frightened by her father's severity. Never had he spoken to her in such a tone. Her confusion changed to apprehension, her color from scarlet to white. She sat dumb and shamefaced, unable to reply.\n\nAppearances were certainly against her; the young girl looked guilty, and the father thinking that perhaps after all what his wife had told him was true, spoke angrily:\n\n\"Then, is it really true that you are daily cursing your step-mother and praying for her death? Have you forgotten what I told you, that although she is your step-mother you must be obedient and loyal to her? What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked? You have certainly changed, my daughter! What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?\"\n\nAnd the father's eyes filled with sudden tears to think that he should have to upbraid his daughter in this way.\n\nShe on her part did not know what he meant, for she had never heard of the superstition that by praying over an image it is possible to cause the death of a hated person. But she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow. She loved her father dearly, and could not bear the idea of his anger. She put out her hand on his knee deprecatingly:\n\n\"Father! father! do not say such dreadful things to me. I am still your obedient child. Indeed, I am. However stupid I may be, I should never be able to curse any one who belonged to you, much less pray for the death of one you love. Surely some one has been telling you lies, and you are dazed, and you know not what you say--or some evil spirit has taken possession of YOUR heart. As for me I do not know--no, not so much as a dew-drop, of the evil thing of which you accuse me.\"\n\nBut the father remembered that she had hidden something away when he first entered the room, and even this earnest protest did not satisfy him. He wished to clear up his doubts once for all.\n\n\"Then why are you always alone in your room these days? And tell me what is that that you have hidden in your sleeve--show it to me at once.\"\n\nThen the daughter, though shy of confessing how she had cherished her mother's memory, saw that she must tell her father all in order to clear herself. So she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him.\n\n\"This,\" she said, \"is what you saw me looking at just now.\"\n\n\"Why,\" he said in great surprise, \"this is the mirror that I brought as a gift to your mother when I went up to the capital many years ago! And so you have kept it all this time? Now, why do you spend so much of your time before this mirror?\"\n\nThen she told him of her mother's last words, and of how she had promised to meet her child whenever she looked into the glass. But still the father could not understand the simplicity of his daughter's character in not knowing that what she saw reflected in the mirror was in reality her own face, and not that of her mother.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror?\"\n\n\"It is indeed true,\" said the girl: \"and if you don't believe what I say, look for yourself,\" and she placed the mirror before her. There, looking back from the smooth metal disk, was her own sweet face. She pointed to the reflection seriously:\n\n\"Do you doubt me still?\" she asked earnestly, looking up into his face.\n\nWith an exclamation of sudden understanding the father smote his two hands together.\n\n\"How stupid I am! At last I understand. Your face is as like your mother's as the two sides of a melon--thus you have looked at the reflection of your face ail this time, thinking that you were brought face to face with your lost mother! You are truly a faithful child. It seems at first a stupid thing to have done, but it is not really so, It shows how deep has been your filial piety, and how innocent your heart. Living in constant remembrance of your lost mother has helped you to grow like her in character.\n\n How clever it was of her to tell you to do this. I admire and respect you, my daughter, and I am ashamed to think that for one instant I believed your suspicious step-mother's story and suspected you of evil, and came with the intention of scolding you severely, while all this time you have been so true and good. Before you I have no countenance left, and I beg you to forgive me.\"\n\nAnd here the father wept. He thought of how lonely the poor girl must have been, and of all that she must have suffered under her step-mother's treatment. His daughter steadfastly keeping her faith and simplicity in the midst of such adverse circumstances--bearing all her troubles with so much patience and amiability--made him compare her to the lotus which rears its blossom of dazzling beauty out of the slime and mud of the moats and ponds, fitting emblem of a heart which keeps itself unsullied while passing through the world.\n\nThe step-mother, anxious to know what would happen, had all this while been standing outside the room. She had grown interested, and had gradually pushed the sliding screen back till she could see all that went on. At this moment she suddenly entered the room, and dropping to the mats, she bowed her head over her outspread hands before her step-daughter.\n\n\"I am ashamed! I am ashamed!\" she exclaimed in broken tones. \"I did not know what a filial child you were. Through no fault of yours, but with a step-mother's jealous heart, I have disliked you all the time. Hating you so much myself, it was but natural that I should think you reciprocated the feeling, and thus when I saw you retire so often to your room I followed you, and when I saw you gaze daily into the mirror for long intervals, I concluded that you had found out how I disliked you, and that you were out of revenge trying to take my life by magic art. \n\nAs long as I live I shall never forget the wrong I have done you in so misjudging you, and in causing your father to suspect you. From this day I throw away my old and wicked heart, and in its place I put a new one, clean and full of repentance. I shall think of you as a child that I have borne myself. I shall love and cherish you with all my heart, and thus try to make up for all the unhappiness I have caused you. Therefore, please throw into the water all that has gone before, and give me, I beg of you, some of the filial love that you have hitherto given to your own lost mother.\"\n\nThus did the unkind step-mother humble herself and ask forgiveness of the girl she had so wronged.\n\nSuch was the sweetness of the girl's disposition that she willingly forgave her step-mother, and never bore a moment's resentment or malice towards her afterwards. The father saw by his wife's face that she was truly sorry for the past, and was greatly relieved to see the terrible misunderstanding wiped out of remembrance by both the wrong-doer and the wronged.\n\nFrom this time on, the three lived together as happily as fish in water. No such trouble ever darkened the home again, and the young girl gradually forgot that year of unhappiness in the tender love and care that her step-mother now bestowed on her. Her patience and goodness were rewarded at last."

Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which washer favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into theair, and catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up sohigh that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball boundedaway, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down intothe spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but itwas very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Thenshe began to bewail her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get myball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, andeverything that I have in the world.’\n\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, andsaid, ‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘whatcan you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into thespring.’ The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fineclothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eatfrom off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring youyour ball again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this sillyfrog is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me,though he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tellhim he shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, ifyou will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog puthis head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a littlewhile he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it onthe edge of the spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball,she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her handagain, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it asfast as she could. The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, andtake me with you as you said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.\n\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard astrange noise—tap, tap—plash, plash—as if something was coming upthe marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock atthe door, and a little voice cried out and said:\n\n'Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.'\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw thefrog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadlyfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back toher seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightenedher, asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she,‘at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring thismorning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that hecould never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and hewants to come in.’\n\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\n\n'Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.'\nThen the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your wordyou must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the froghopped into the room, and then straight on—tap, tap—plash, plash—from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to thetable where the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he tothe princess, ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had donethis, the frog said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat outof it.’ This she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, hesaid, ‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’And the princess, though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, andput him upon the pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long.As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went outof the house. ‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone,and I shall be troubled with him no more.’\n\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the sametapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\n\n'Open the door, my princess dear, Open the door to thy true love here! And mind the words that thou and I said By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.'\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept uponher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night hedid the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning shewas astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazingon her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing atthe head of her bed.\n\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who hadchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide tillsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat fromher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said theprince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wishfor but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where Iwill marry you, and love you as long as you live.’\n\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ toall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautifulhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; andbehind the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who hadbewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment solong and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\n\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eighthorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’skingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily agreat many years."

      "body": "The Ice Heart Princess:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a magical world on the edge of imagination, was a princess with a heart as cold and empty as ice. She had the most electrifying clear blue eyes, and the most silver hair that any girl in the kingdoms would have died for. She had anything anyone could ever wish for, but she was still unsatisfied. She had all the men and princes throughout all the kingdoms wishing to marry her, and yet she had not batted an eyelash. She had the most enchanting, most perfect life, and still she felt nothing. She was immune to any love in the world, and cared for nothing but one thing: She wanted to live forever.\n\nWith immortality, she would be able to explore all the knowledge and magic in the world. She would be a legend to last for eternity. She explored all the lands, books and scrolls, in order for just a tiny hint at the secret of immortality, and on one fateful day, she discovered the Earth Spirit. The Earth Spirit was said to grant any wish to the person who could find her, and the princess knew that she had to find the Spirit to get her wish.\n\n\"Earth Spirit, grant me the wish of immortality, for if you deny my wish, you will be caught and put into jail. You will be cursed,\" the Princess demanded.\n\n“Princess, you are the person who has finally found me, but you must pass three tests in order for me to grant the wish of immortality to you. These three tests will test you on: kindness, wisdom, and perseverance. Once you have passed the tests, I will grant you your wish,\" the Earth Spirit replied.\n\nWith a huff of impatience, the princess stomped away, muttering insults about the Earth Spirit.\n\nThe following day, when the princess was in the village, she encountered an old lady in rags that begged her for food. The princess stared into the eyes of the old lady and sneered: \"I will absolutely not donate food to a poor woman like you, it is not worth it,\" and turned away, galloping away on her horse, followed by a stampede of soldiers. The old lady was left on an empty road with new dirt stains on her clothes.\n\nThe next day, the princess's servant went up to her and asked,\" Would you rather save the life of this entire kingdom, or would you save your own life?\"\n\nThe princess thought this was an extremely stupid and strange question and snapped, \"What do you think? Of course my life is more precious than yours; obviously I would save my own life!\"\n\nOn the third day a visitor came to the castle and announced that if the princess was able to complete a challenge, a great gift would await her. With excitement, the princess agreed to the challenge and waited for the instructions. Apparently, the visitor was a jewellery maker and wanted the princess to go into the enchanted forest to pick out all the stones and gems needed in order to be made into a necklace. The princess was impatient and after a while gave up.\n\nWith anger, the princess screamed out for the Earth Spirit and asked when the tests would start so she could become immortal and master all magic.\n\nThe Earth Spirit appeared out of nowhere and speaking very calmly said, \"I am truly sorry, but you have not passed the three tests. On the first day, when I begged you for food, you were not kind enough to donate food, meaning you failed the test of kindness. On the second day, I asked you would you rather save the whole kingdom or save yourself. You said you would save yourself. That is not an act of wisdom, causing you to fail the test of being wise. And just now, you have proved that you are very impatient and you don’t like to persevere. This means you failed all three tests. However, because of your cruelness, I will grant your wish...with a twist. You will live forever, for all eternity, but you will be called the Ice Princess. You will be locked up in the ice castle on the highest peak in all of the kingdoms, and you shall never be found. Your heart shall be made of ice. The only way you are able to break this curse is to show acts of kindness. Whenever you show kindness, a little bit of your heart will melt. However, that will take an eternity. For now, you will have to wait.\"\n\nWith a sudden whoosh, the Princess's destiny was sealed, and she became the Ice Princess.\n\nDecades and centuries after, the Ice Princess's story still went around. Some say it snows and rains when she mourns over her mistakes, and some say the story was just a story they use to teach lessons to bad little kids.\n\nBut to those believers, the Ice Princess is still trying to fix her mistakes. She sends food and water to people in need with her new magic, and even though she's lonely, she knows that just maybe, one day the curse will be broken, so her heart could finally be free."

She detested her husband, because he was much older than her.\n\nHer infidelity drove her to become friendly with some other young men. One day, she met such a man who showed interest in her. But the man was in fact a thief. He knew that she was a lewd woman and had a lot of money with her. So, with a pretension of love, he decided to rob her. He said to her, I love you very much. I know, you too love me. Why don't you marry me. Come to me with some money. Then, we'll run Alay to some other town; marry there and live comfortably, thereafter.\"\n\nThe carpenter's wife readily agreed to his proposal. She was herself looking for such an opportunity. She decided to take away with her all the wealth of her husband.\n\nOne night, when her husband was fast asleep, she put all the gold and silver ornaments and the money in a bag and left the house. She met her thief boyfriend and they both started moving to some other town. They walked for hours and came across a river. They had to cross the river to reach another town.\n\nAs the young man had the only motive of robbing the woman of her ornaments and money, he said to her, \"Darling, we have to cross this river to reach another town. We should do it immediately before the break of dawn, otherwise, we might be caught by your husband and relatives.\"\n\n\"But I don't know how to swim,\" the lady said.\n\n\"Don't worry, first I'll cross the river and deposit the wealth on the other bank of this river, and then I'll come back and carry you.\"\n\nThe woman gladly handed over the money-bag to the thief. The thief again said, \"Take off your costly clothes also. I'll carry them safe and dry across the river.\"\n\nThe woman, then, took off her clothes also and gave them to the thief.\n\nThe thief took the wealth and the clothes and then walked off.\n\nThe woman, all naked, sat on the bank of the river waiting for hours and hours for the thief to return, but the thief didn't show up again.\n\nJust then, a wolf wandered there with a piece of meat in his mouth. When he saw a fish in the river water, he put down the piece of meat and ran to catch the fish. Just then, an owl swooped down upon the piece of meat and flew away with it. On the other hand, the fish too swam back deep into the river. The wolf now had nothing to eat. The woman said to the wolf, \"What'll you eat now? you've lost the meat and fish both.\"\n\nThe clever wolf understood all that had happened. He said to the woman, \"Your condition is more pitiable than mine. I, nonetheless, would somehow, manage to get food, but what about you? You've become naked and also lost your husband, lover, the wealth and even the costly clothes. Who'll give shelter to you? Who'll accept you, now?\" \n\nThe wolf went away, laughing sarcastically at the woman, leaving her to her own destiny.\n\nMoral: Bad deeds bring bad consequences."

The donkey had an insatiable appetite for food, but was least interested in doing his master's work. And Shuddhapata was very poor. It was not possible for him to feed his always-hungry and lazy donkey. Therefore, as a result the donkey became lean and thin.\n\nOnce the washerman had to go to the town to purchase soap etc. for washing clothes. He had to pass through a jungle on his way to the town. While returning from the town, he found a leopard's skin in the jungle. He immediately thought of a plan to feed his lazy donkey.\n\nWhen the night fell, he donned his donkey with the leopard's skin and drove him to the nearby fields. The farmers were frightened to see a leopard roaming in their fields and ran away. The donkey ate his fill and returned home in the early hours of morning. This continued for months together. Soon the donkey became fat and healthy. No farmer ever dared come near him. The donkey passed his days and nights happily.\n\nOne night, as the donkey was feeding itself in a neighbouring field, it heard another donkey braying in a nearby village.

      "body": "The Jelly Fish And The Monkey:\n\nLong, long ago, in old Japan, the Kingdom of the Sea was governed by a wonderful King. He was called Rin Jin, or the Dragon King of the Sea. His power was immense, for he was the ruler of all sea creatures both great and small, and in his keeping were the Jewels of the Ebb and Flow of the Tide. The Jewel of the Ebbing Tide when thrown into the ocean caused the sea to recede from the land, and the Jewel of the Flowing Tide made the waves to rise mountains high and to flow in upon the shore like a tidal wave.\n\nThe Palace of Rin Jin was at the bottom of the sea, and was so beautiful that no one has ever seen anything like it even in dreams. The walls were of coral, the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase, and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl. But the Dragon King, in spite of his wide-spreading Kingdom, his beautiful Palace and all its wonders, and his power which none disputed throughout the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone.\n\nAt last he thought that if he married he would not only be happier, but also more powerful. So he decided to take a wife. Calling all his fish retainers together, he chose several of them as ambassadors to go through the sea and seek for a young Dragon Princess who would be his bride.\n\nAt last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon. Her scales were of glittering green like the wings of summer beetles, her eyes threw out glances of fire, and she was dressed in gorgeous robes. All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them.\n\nThe King fell in love with her at once, and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor. Every living thing in the sea, from the great whales down to the little shrimps, came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them a long and prosperous life. Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the Fish-World before. The train of bearers who carried the bride's possessions to her new home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other. Each fish carried a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes, gleaming blue and pink and silver; and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white and green fire, for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honor of the event.\n\nNow for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily. They loved each other dearly, and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures of his coral Palace, and she was never tired of wandering with him through its vast halls and gardens. Life seemed to them both like a long summer's day.\n\nTwo months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to stay in bed. The King was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill, and at once sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine. He gave special orders to the servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence, but in spite of all the nurses' assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse.\n\nThen the Dragon King interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen. The doctor was alarmed at Rin Jin's evident displeasure, and excused his want of skill by saying that although he knew the right kind of medicine to give the invalid, it was impossible to find it in the sea.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you can't get the medicine here?\" asked the Dragon King.\n\n\"It is just as you say!\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Tell me what it is you want for the Queen?\" demanded Rin Jin.\n\n\"I want the liver of a live monkey!\" answered the doctor.\n\n\"The liver of a live monkey! Of course that will be most difficult to get,\" said the King.\n\n\"If we could only get that for the Queen, Her Majesty would soon recover,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Very well, that decides it; we MUST get it somehow or other. But where are we most likely to find a monkey?\" asked the King.\n\nThen the doctor told the Dragon King that some distance to the south there was a Monkey Island where a great many monkeys lived.\n\n\"If only you could capture one of these monkeys?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"How can any of my people capture a monkey?\" said the Dragon King, greatly puzzled. \"The monkeys live on dry land, while we live in the water; and out of our element we are quite powerless! I don't see what we can do!\"\n\n\"That has been my difficulty too,\" said the doctor. \"But amongst your innumerable servants you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose!\"\n\n\"Something must be done,\" said the King, and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter.\n\nThe chief steward thought for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, said joyfully:\n\n\"I know what we must do! There is the kurage (jelly fish). He is certainly ugly to look at, but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. Let us send him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one.\"\n\nThe jelly fish was then summoned to the King's presence, and was told by His Majesty what was required of him.\n\nThe jelly fish, on being told of the unexpected mission which was to be intrusted to him, looked very troubled, and said that he had never been to the island in question, and as he had never had any experience in catching monkeys he was afraid that he would not be able to get one.\n\n\"Well,\" said the chief steward, \"if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey. The only way is to play a trick on one!\"\n\n\"How can I play a trick on a monkey? I don't know how to do it,\" said the perplexed jelly fish.\n\n\"This is what you must do,\" said the wily chief steward. \"When you approach the Island of Monkeys and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's Palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!\"\n\n\"But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim?\" said the reluctant jelly fish.\n\n\"You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!\" said the chief steward.\n\n\"Won't he be very heavy?\" queried kurage again.\n\n\"You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King,\" replied the chief steward.\n\n\"I will do my best then,\" said the jelly fish, and he swam away from the Palace and started off towards the Monkey Island. Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours, and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore. On looking round he saw not far away a big pine-tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for--a live monkey.\n\n\"I'm in luck!\" thought the jelly fish. \"Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the Palace, and my part will be done!\"\n\nSo the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree. In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. When he got to the pine-tree he raised his voice and said:\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?\"\n\n\"A very fine day,\" answered the monkey from the tree. \"I have never seen you in this part of the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is kurage or jelly fish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it,\" answered the jelly fish.\n\n\"I am very glad to see you,\" said the monkey.\n\n\"By the bye,\" said the jelly fish, \"have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?\"\n\n\"I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!\" answered the monkey.\n\n\"Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description--it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world,\" said the jelly fish.\n\n\"Is it so beautiful as all that?\" asked the monkey in astonishment.\n\nThen the jelly fish saw his chance, and went on describing to the best of his ability the beauty and grandeur of the Sea King's Palace, and the wonders of the garden with its curious trees of white, pink and red coral, and the still more curious fruits like great jewels hanging on the branches. The monkey grew more and more interested, and as he listened he came down the tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story.\n\n\"I have got him at last!\" thought the jelly fish, but aloud he said:\n\n\"Mr. Monkey. I must now go back. As you have never seen the Palace of the Dragon King, won't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you--a land-lubber.\"\n\n\"I should love to go,\" said the monkey, \"but how am I to cross the water! I can't swim, as you surely know!\"\n\n\"There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back.\"\n\n\"That will be troubling you too much,\" said the monkey.\n\n\"I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate,\" said the jelly fish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.\n\n\"Keep very still, Mr. monkey,\" said the jelly fish. \"You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the King's Palace.\"\n\n\"Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off,\" said the monkey.\n\nThus they went along, the jelly fish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on his back. When they were about half-way, the jelly fish, who knew very little of anatomy, began to wonder if the monkey had his liver with him or not!\n\n\"Mr. Monkey, tell me, have you such a thing as a liver with you?\"\n\nThe monkey was very much surprised at this queer question, and asked what the jelly fish wanted with a liver.\n\n\"That is the most important thing of all,\" said the stupid jelly fish, \"so as soon as I recollected it, I asked you if you had yours with you?\"\n\n\"Why is my liver so important to you?\" asked the monkey.\n\n\"Oh! you will learn the reason later,\" said the jelly fish.\n\nThe monkey grew more and more curious and suspicious, and urged the jelly fish to tell him for what his liver was wanted, and ended up by appealing to his hearer's feelings by saying that he was very troubled at what he had been told.\n\nThen the jelly fish, seeing how anxious the monkey looked, was sorry for him, and told him everything. How the Dragon Queen had fallen ill, and how the doctor had said that only the liver of a live monkey would cure her, and how the Dragon King had sent him to find one.\n\n\"Now I have done as I was told, and as soon as we arrive at the Palace the doctor will want your liver, so I feel sorry for you!\" said the silly jelly fish.\n\nThe poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this, and very angry at the trick played upon him. He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.\n\nBut the monkey was a clever animal, and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign of the fear he felt, so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape.\n\n\"The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out! Why I shall die!\" thought the monkey. At last a bright thought struck him, so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish:\n\n\"What a pity it was, Mr. Jelly Fish, that you did not speak of this before we left the island!\"\n\n\"If I had told why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come,\" answered the jelly fish.\n\n\"You are quite mistaken,\" said the monkey. \"Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two, especially when it is wanted for the Dragon Queen of the Sea. If I had only guessed of what you were in need. I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers. But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging on the pine-tree.\"\n\n\"Have you left your liver behind you?\" asked the jelly fish.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the cunning monkey, \"during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree. To-day, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when I came off with you. If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it, and should have brought it along with me!\"\n\nThe jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this, for he believed every word the monkey said. The monkey was of no good without a liver. Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so.\n\n\"Well,\" said the monkey, \"that is soon remedied. I am really sorry to think of all your trouble; but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me, I shall soon be able to get my liver.\"\n\nThe jelly fish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again; but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his very best liver, and bring it with him the next time. Thus persuaded, the jelly fish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more.\n\nNo sooner had the jelly fish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed, and getting up into the pine-tree where the jelly fish had first seen him, he cut several capers amongst the branches with joy at being safe home again, and then looking down at the jelly fish said:\n\n\"So many thanks for all the trouble you have taken! Please present my compliments to the Dragon King on your return!\"\n\nThe jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered. Then he asked the monkey if it wasn't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver.\n\nThe monkey replied laughingly that he couldn't afford to lose his liver: it was too precious.\n\n\"But remember your promise!\" pleaded the jelly fish, now very discouraged.\n\n\"That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!\" answered the monkey. Then he began to jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea King's Palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jelly fish to return under false pretenses.\n\n\"Of course, I won't GIVE you my liver, but come and get it if you can!\" added the monkey mockingly from the tree.\n\nThere was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back. The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the monkey laughing at him.\n\nMeanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish. When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace, they hailed him with delight. They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was.\n\nNow the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish. He quaked all over as he told his story. How he had brought the monkey halfway over the sea, and then had stupidly let out the secret of his commission; how the monkey had deceived him by making him believe that he had left his liver behind him.\n\nThe Dragon King's wrath was great, and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be severely punished. The punishment was a horrible one. All the bones were to be drawn out from his living body, and he was to be beaten with sticks.\n\nThe poor jelly fish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon. But the Dragon King's order had to be obeyed. The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jelly fish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp, and then took him out beyond the Palace gates and threw him into the water. Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness.\n\nFrom this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan."

      "body": "The Snow Queen:\n\nA Tale in Seven Stories:\n\n------------\nFirst Story:\nWhich Has to Do with a Mirror and its Fragments\nNow then! We will begin. When the story is done you shall know a great deal more than you do know.\n\nHe was a terribly bad hobgoblin, a goblin of the very wickedest sort and, in fact, he was the devil himself. One day the devil was in a very good humor because he had just finished a mirror which had this peculiar power: everything good and beautiful that was reflected in it seemed to dwindle to almost nothing at all, while everything that was worthless and ugly became most conspicuous and even uglier than ever. In this mirror the loveliest landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the very best people became hideous, or stood on their heads and had no stomachs. Their faces were distorted beyond any recognition, and if a person had a freckle it was sure to spread until it covered both nose and mouth.\n\n\"That's very funny!\" said the devil. If a good, pious thought passed through anyone's mind, it showed in the mirror as a carnal grin, and the devil laughed aloud at his ingenious invention.\n\nAll those who went to the hobgoblin's school-for he had a school of his own-told everyone that a miracle had come to pass. Now, they asserted, for the very first time you could see how the world and its people really looked. They scurried about with the mirror until there was not a person alive nor a land on earth that had not been distorted.\n\nThen they wanted to fly up to heaven itself, to scoff at the angels, and our Lord. The higher they flew with the mirror, the wider it grinned. They could hardly manage to hold it. Higher they flew, and higher still, nearer to heaven and the angels. Then the grinning mirror trembled with such violence that it slipped from their hands and fell to the earth, where it shattered into hundreds of millions of billions of bits, or perhaps even more. And now it caused more trouble than it did before it was broken, because some of the fragments were smaller than a grain of sand and these went flying throughout the wide world. Once they got in people's eyes they would stay there. These bits of glass distorted everything the people saw, and made them see only the bad side of things, for every little bit of glass kept the same power that the whole mirror had possessed.\n\nA few people even got a glass splinter in their hearts, and that was a terrible thing, for it turned their hearts into lumps of ice. Some of the fragments were so large that they were used as window panes-but not the kind of window through which you should look at your friends. Other pieces were made into spectacles, and evil things came to pass when people put them on to see clearly and to see justice done. The fiend was so tickled by it all that he laughed till his sides were sore. But fine bits of the glass are still flying through the air, and now you shall hear what happened.\n\n------------\nSecond Story:\nA Little Boy and a Little Girl\nIn the big city it was so crowded with houses and people that few found room for even a small garden and most people had to be content with a flowerpot, but two poor children who lived there managed to have a garden that was a little bigger than a flowerpot. These children were not brother and sister, but they loved each other just as much as if they had been. Their parents lived close to one another in the garrets of two adjoining houses. Where the roofs met and where the rain gutter ran between the two houses, their two small windows faced each other. One had only to step across the rain gutter to go from window to window.\n\nIn these windows, the parents had a large box where they planted vegetables for their use, and a little rose bush too. Each box had a bush, which thrived to perfection. Then it occurred to the parents to put these boxes across the gutter, where they very nearly reached from one window to the other, and looked exactly like two walls of flowers. The pea plants hung down over the boxes, and the rose bushes threw out long sprays that framed the windows and bent over toward each other. It was almost like a little triumphal arch of greenery and flowers. The boxes were very high, and the children knew that they were not to climb about on them, but they were often allowed to take their little stools out on the roof under the roses, where they had a wonderful time playing together.\n\nWinter, of course, put an end to this pleasure. The windows often frosted over completely. But they would heat copper pennies on the stove and press these hot coins against the frost-coated glass. Then they had the finest of peepholes, as round as a ring, and behind them appeared a bright, friendly eye, one at each window-it was the little boy and the little girl who peeped out. His name was Kay and hers was Gerda. With one skip they could join each other in summer, but to visit together in the wintertime they had to go all the way downstairs in one house, and climb all the way upstairs in the other. Outside the snow was whirling.\n\n\"See the white bees swarming,\" the old grandmother said.\n\n\"Do they have a queen bee, too?\" the little boy asked, for he knew that real bees have one.\n\n\"Yes, indeed they do,\" the grandmother said. \"She flies in the thick of the swarm. She is the biggest bee of all, and can never stay quietly on the earth, but goes back again to the dark clouds. Many a wintry night she flies through the streets and peers in through the windows. Then they freeze over in a strange fashion, as if they were covered with flowers.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, we've seen that,\" both the children said, and so they knew it was true.\n\n\"Can the Snow Queen come in here?\" the little girl asked.\n\n\"Well, let her come!\" cried the boy. \"I would put her on the hot stove and melt her.\"\n\nBut Grandmother stroked his head, and told them other stories.\n\nThat evening when little Kay was at home and half ready for bed, he climbed on the chair by the window and looked out through the little peephole. A few snowflakes were falling, and the largest flake of all alighted on the edge of one of the flower boxes. This flake grew bigger and bigger, until at last it turned into a woman, who was dressed in the finest white gauze which looked as if it had been made from millions of star-shaped flakes. She was beautiful and she was graceful, but she was ice-shining, glittering ice. She was alive, for all that, and her eyes sparkled like two bright stars, but in them there was neither rest nor peace. She nodded toward the window and beckoned with her hand. The little boy was frightened, and as he jumped down from the chair it seemed to him that a huge bird flew past the window.\n\nThe next day was clear and cold. Then the snow thawed, and springtime came. The sun shone, the green grass sprouted, swallows made their nests, windows were thrown open, and once again the children played in their little roof garden, high up in the rain gutter on top of the house.\n\nThat summer the roses bloomed their splendid best. The little girl had learned a hymn in which there was a line about roses that reminded her of their own flowers. She sang it to the little boy, and he sang it with her:\n\n\"Where roses bloom so sweetly in the vale,\nThere shall you find the Christ Child, without fail.\"\nThe children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked up at the Lord's clear sunshine, and spoke to it as if the Christ Child were there. What glorious summer days those were, and how beautiful it was out under those fragrant rose bushes which seemed as if they would never stop blooming.\n\nKay and Gerda were looking at a picture book of birds and beasts one day, and it was then-just as the clock in the church tower was striking five-that Kay cried:\n\n\"Oh! something hurt my heart. And now I've got something in my eye.\"\n\nThe little girl put her arm around his neck, and he blinked his eye. No, she couldn't see anything in it.\n\n\"I think it's gone,\" he said. But it was not gone. It was one of those splinters of glass from the magic mirror. You remember that goblin's mirror-the one which made everything great and good that was reflected in it appear small and ugly, but which magnified all evil things until each blemish loomed large. Poor Kay! A fragment had pierced his heart as well, and soon it would turn into a lump of ice. The pain had stopped, but the glass was still there.\n\n\"Why should you be crying?\" he asked. \"It makes you look so ugly. There's nothing the matter with me.\" And suddenly he took it into his head to say:\n\n\"Ugh! that rose is all worm-eaten. And look, this one is crooked. And these roses, they are just as ugly as they can be. They look like the boxes they grow in.\" He gave the boxes a kick, and broke off both of the roses.\n\n\"Kay! what are you doing?\" the little girl cried. When he saw how it upset her, he broke off another rose and then leaped home through his own window, leaving dear little Gerda all alone.\n\nAfterwards, when she brought out her picture book, he said it was fit only for babes in the cradle. And whenever Grandmother told stories, he always broke in with a \"but-.\" If he could manage it he would steal behind her, perch a pair of spectacles on his nose, and imitate her. He did this so cleverly that it made everybody laugh, and before long he could mimic the walk and the talk of everyone who lived on that street. Everything that was odd or ugly about them, Kay could mimic so well that people said, \"That boy has surely got a good head on him!\" But it was the glass in his eye and the glass in his heart that made him tease even little Gerda, who loved him with all her soul.\n\nNow his games were very different from what they used to be. They became more sensible. When the snow was flying about one wintry day, he brought a large magnifying glass out of doors and spread the tail of his blue coat to let the snowflakes fall on it.\n\n\"Now look through the glass,\" he told Gerda. Each snowflake seemed much larger, and looked like a magnificent flower or a ten-pointed star. It was marvelous to look at.\n\n\"Look, how artistic!\" said Kay. \"They are much more interesting to look at than real flowers, for they are absolutely perfect. There isn't a flaw in them, until they start melting.\"\n\nA little while later Kay came down with his big gloves on his hands and his sled on his back. Right in Gerda's ear he bawled out, \"I've been given permission to play in the big square where the other boys are!\" and away he ran.\n\nIn the square some of the more adventuresome boys would tie their little sleds on behind the farmer's carts, to be pulled along for quite a distance. It was wonderful sport. While the fun was at its height, a big sleigh drove up. It was painted entirely white, and the driver wore a white, shaggy fur cloak and a white, shaggy cap. As the sleigh drove twice around the square, Kay quickly hooked his little sled behind it, and down the street they went, faster and faster. The driver turned around in a friendly fashion and nodded to Kay, just as if they were old acquaintances. Every time Kay started to unfasten his little sleigh, its driver nodded again, and Kay held on, even when they drove right out through the town gate.\n\nThen the snow began to fall so fast that the boy could not see his hands in front of him, as they sped on. He suddenly let go the slack of the rope in his hands, in order so get loose from the big sleigh, but it did no good. His little sled was tied on securely, and they went like the wind. He gave a loud shout, but nobody heard him. The snow whirled and the sleigh flew along. Every now and then it gave a jump, as if it were clearing hedges and ditches. The boy was terror-stricken. He tried to say his prayers, but all he could remember was his multiplication tables.\n\nThe snowflakes got bigger and bigger, until they looked like big white hens. All of a sudden the curtain of snow parted, and the big sleigh stopped and the driver stood up. The fur coat and the cap were made of snow, and it was a woman, tall and slender and blinding white-she was the Snow Queen herself.\n\n\"We have made good time,\" she said. \"Is it possible that you tremble from cold? Crawl under my bear coat.\" She took him up in the sleigh beside her, and as she wrapped the fur about him he felt as if he were sinking into a snowdrift.\n\n\"Are you still cold?\" she asked, and kissed him on the forehead. Brer-r-r. That kiss was colder than ice. He felt it right down to his heart, half of which was already an icy lump. He felt as if he were dying, but only for a moment. Then he felt quite comfortable, and no longer noticed the cold.\n\n\"My sled! Don't forget my sled!\" It was the only thing he thought of. They tied it to one of the white hens, which flew along after them with the sled on its back. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once more, and then he forgot little Gerda, and Grandmother, and all the others at home.\n\n\"You won't get any more kisses now,\" she said, \"or else I should kiss you to death.\" Kay looked at her. She was so beautiful! A cleverer and prettier face he could not imagine. She no longer seemed to be made of ice, as she had seemed when she sat outside his window and beckoned to him. In his eyes she was perfect, and she was not at all afraid. He told her how he could do mental arithmetic even with fractions, and that he knew the size and population of all the countries. She kept on smiling, and he began to be afraid that he did not know as much as he thought he did. He looked up at the great big space overhead, as she flew with him high up on the black clouds, while the storm whistled and roared as if it were singing old ballads.\n\nThey flew over forests and lakes, over many a land and sea. Below them the wind blew cold, wolves howled, and black crows screamed as they skimmed across the glittering snow. But up above the moon shone bright and large, and on it Kay fixed his eyes throughout that long, long winter night. By day he slept at the feet of the Snow Queen.\n\n------------\nThird Story:\nThe Flower Garden of the Woman Skilled in Magic\nHow did little Gerda get along when Kay did not come back? Where could he be? Nobody knew. Nobody could give them any news of him. All that the boys could say was that they had seen him hitch his little sled to a fine big sleigh, which had driven down the street and out through the town gate. Nobody knew what had become of Kay. Many tears were shed, and little Gerda sobbed hardest of all. People said that he was dead-that he must have been drowned in the river not far from town. Ah, how gloomy those long winter days were!\n\nBut spring and its warm sunshine came at last.\n\n\"Kay is dead and gone,\" little Gerda said.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the sunshine.\n\n\"He's dead and gone,\" she said to the swallows.\n\n\"We don't believe it,\" they sang. Finally little Gerda began to disbelieve it too. One morning she said to herself:\n\n\"I'll put on my new red shoes, the ones Kay has never seen, and I'll go down by the river to ask about him.\"\n\nIt was very early in the morning. She kissed her old grandmother, who was still asleep, put on her red shoes, and all by herself she hurried out through the town gate and down to the river.\n\n\"Is it true that you have taken my own little playmate? I'll give you my red shoes if you will bring him back to me.\"\n\nIt seemed to her that the waves nodded very strangely. So she took off her red shoes that were her dearest possession, and threw them into the river. But they fell near the shore, and the little waves washed them right back to her. It seemed that the river could not take her dearest possession, because it did not have little Kay. However, she was afraid that she had not thrown them far enough, so she clambered into a boat that lay among the reeds, walked to the end of it, and threw her shoes out into the water again. But the boat was not tied, and her movements made it drift away from the bank. She realized this, and tried to get ashore, but by the time she reached the other end of the boat it was already more than a yard from the bank, and was fast gaining speed.\n\nLittle Gerda was so frightened that she began to cry, and no one was there to hear her except the sparrows. They could not carry her to land, but they flew along the shore twittering, \"We are here! Here we are!\" as if to comfort her. The boat drifted swiftly down the stream, and Gerda sat there quite still, in her stocking feet. Her little red shoes floated along behind, but they could not catch up with her because the boat was gathering headway. It was very pretty on both sides of the river, where the flowers were lovely, the trees were old, and the hillsides afforded pasture for cattle and sheep. But not one single person did Gerda see.\n\n\"Perhaps the river will take me to little Kay,\" she thought, and that made her feel more cheerful. She stood up and watched the lovely green banks for hour after hour.\n\nThen she came to a large cherry orchard, in which there was a little house with strange red and blue windows. It had a thatched roof, and outside it stood two wooden soldiers, who presented arms to everyone who sailed past.\n\nGerda thought they were alive, and called out to them, but of course they did not answer her. She drifted quite close to them as the current drove the boat toward the bank. Gerda called even louder, and an old, old woman came out of the house. She leaned on a crooked stick; she had on a big sun hat, and on it were painted the most glorious flowers.\n\n\"You poor little child!\" the old woman exclaimed. \"However did you get lost on this big swift river, and however did you drift so far into the great wide world?\" The old woman waded right into the water, caught hold of the boat with her crooked stick, pulled it in to shore, and lifted little Gerda out of it.\n\nGerda was very glad to be on dry land again, but she felt a little afraid of this strange old woman, who said to her:\n\n\"Come and tell me who you are, and how you got here.\" Gerda told her all about it. The woman shook her head and said, \"Hmm, hmm!\" And when Gerda had told her everything and asked if she hadn't seen little Kay, the woman said he had not yet come by, but that he might be along any day now. And she told Gerda not to take it so to heart, but to taste her cherries and to look at her flowers. These were more beautiful than any picture book, and each one had a story to tell. Then she led Gerda by the hand into her little house, and the old woman locked the door.\n\nThe windows were placed high up on the walls, and through their red, blue, and yellow panes the sunlight streamed in a strange mixture of all the colors there are. But on the table were the most delicious cherries, and Gerda, who was no longer afraid, ate as many as she liked. While she was eating them, the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb. Gerda's pretty hair fell in shining yellow ringlets on either side of a friendly little face that was as round and blooming as a rose.\n\n\"I've so often wished for a dear little girl like you,\" the old woman told her. \"Now you'll see how well the two of us will get along.\" While her hair was being combed, Gerda gradually forgot all about Kay, for the old woman was skilled in magic. But she was not a wicked witch. She only dabbled in magic to amuse herself, but she wanted very much to keep little Gerda. So she went out into her garden and pointed her crooked stick at all the rose bushes. In the full bloom of their beauty, all of them sank down into the black earth, without leaving a single trace behind. The old woman was afraid that if Gerda saw them they would remind her so strongly of her own roses, and of little Kay, that she would run away again.\n\nThen Gerda was led into the flower garden. How fragrant and lovely it was! Every known flower of every season was there in full bloom. No picture book was ever so pretty and gay. Gerda jumped for joy, and played in the garden until the sun went down behind the tall cherry trees. Then she was tucked into a beautiful bed, under a red silk coverlet quilted with blue violets. There she slept, and there she dreamed as gloriously as any queen on her wedding day.\n\nThe next morning she again went out into the warm sunshine to play with the flowers-and this she did for many a day. Gerda knew every flower by heart, and, plentiful though they were, she always felt that there was one missing, but which one she didn't quite know. One day she sat looking at the old woman's sun hat, and the prettiest of all the flowers painted on it was a rose. The old woman had forgotten this rose on her hat when she made the real roses disappear in the earth. But that's just the sort of thing that happens when one doesn't stop to think.\n\n\"Why aren't there any roses here?\" said Gerda. She rushed out among the flower beds, and she looked and she looked, but there wasn't a rose to be seen. Then she sat down and cried. But her hot tears fell on the very spot where a rose bush had sunk into the ground, and when her warm tears moistened the earth the bush sprang up again, as full of blossoms as when it disappeared. Gerda hugged it, and kissed the roses. She remembered her own pretty roses, and thought of little Kay.\n\n\"Oh how long I have been delayed,\" the little girl said. \"I should have been looking for Kay. Don't you know where he is?\" she asked the roses. \"Do you think that he is dead and gone?\"\n\n\"He isn't dead,\" the roses told her. \"We have been down in the earth where the dead people are, but Kay is not there.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said little Gerda, who went to all the other flowers, put her lips near them and asked, \"Do you know where little Kay is?\"\n\nBut every flower stood in the sun, and dreamed its own fairy tale, or its story. Though Gerda listened to many, many of them, not one of the flowers knew anything about Kay.\n\nWhat did the tiger lily say?\n\n\"Do you hear the drum? Boom, boom! It was only two notes, always boom, boom! Hear the women wail. Hear the priests chant. The Hindoo woman in her long red robe stands on the funeral pyre. The flames rise around her and her dead husband, but the Hindoo woman is thinking of that living man in the crowd around them. She is thinking of him whose eyes are burning hotter than the flames-of him whose fiery glances have pierced her heart more deeply than these flames that soon will burn her body to ashes. Can the flame of the heart die in the flame of the funeral pyre?\"\n\n\"I don't understand that at all,\" little Gerda said.\n\n\"That's my fairy tale,\" said the lily.\n\nWhat did the trumpet flower say?\n\n\"An ancient castle rises high from a narrow path in the mountains. The thick ivy grows leaf upon leaf where it climbs to the balcony. There stands a beautiful maiden. She leans out over the balustrade to look down the path. No rose on its stem is as graceful as she, nor is any apple blossom in the breeze so light. Hear the rustle of her silk gown, sighing, 'Will he never come?'\"\n\n\"Do you mean Kay?\" little Gerda asked.\n\n\"I am talking about my story, my own dream,\" the trumpet flower replied.\n\nWhat did the little snowdrop say?\n\n\"Between the trees a board hangs by two ropes. It is a swing. Two pretty little girls, with frocks as white as snow, and long green ribbons fluttering from their hats, are swinging. Their brother, who is bigger than they are, stands behind them on the swing, with his arms around the ropes to hold himself. In one hand he has a little cup, and in the other a clay pipe. He is blowing soap bubbles, and as the swing flies the bubbles float off in all their changing colors. The last bubble is still clinging to the bowl of his pipe, and fluttering in the air as the swing sweeps to and fro. A little black dog, light as a bubble, is standing on his hind legs and trying to get up in the swing. But it does not stop. High and low the swing flies, until the dog loses his balance, barks, and loses his temper. They tease him, and the bubble bursts. A swinging board pictured in a bubble before it broke-that is my story.\"\n\n\"It may be a very pretty story, but you told it very sadly and you didn't mention Kay at all.\"\n\nWhat did the hyacinths say?\n\n\"There were three sisters, quite transparent and very fair. One wore a red dress, the second wore a blue one, and the third went all in white. Hand in hand they danced in the clear moonlight, beside a calm lake. They were not elfin folk. They were human beings. The air was sweet, and the sisters disappeared into the forest. The fragrance of the air grew sweeter. Three coffins, in which lie the three sisters, glide out of the forest and across the lake. The fireflies hover about them like little flickering lights. Are the dancing sisters sleeping or are they dead? The fragrance of the flowers says they are dead, and the evening bell tolls for their funeral.\"\n\n\"You are making me very unhappy,\" little Gerda said. \"Your fragrance is so strong that I cannot help thinking of those dead sisters. Oh, could little Kay really be dead? The roses have been down under the ground, and they say no.\"\n\n\"Ding, dong,\" tolled the hyacinth bells. \"We do not toll for little Kay. We do not know him. We are simply singing our song-the only song we know.\"\n\nAnd Gerda went on to the buttercup that shone among its glossy green leaves.\n\n\"You are like a bright little sun,\" said Gerda. \"Tell me, do you know where I can find my playmate?\"\n\nAnd the buttercup shone brightly as it looked up at Gerda. But what sort of song would a buttercup sing? It certainly wouldn't be about Kay.\n\n\"In a small courtyard, God's sun was shining brightly on the very first day of spring. Its beams glanced along the white wall of the house next door, and close by grew the first yellow flowers of spring shining like gold in the warm sunlight. An old grandmother was sitting outside in her chair. Her granddaughter, a poor but very pretty maidservant, had just come home for a little visit. She kissed her grandmother, and there was gold, a heart full of gold, in that kiss. Gold on her lips, gold in her dreams, and gold above in the morning beams. There, I've told you my little story,\" said the buttercup.\n\n\"Oh, my poor old Grandmother,\" said Gerda. \"She will miss me so. She must be grieving for me as much as she did for little Kay. But I'll soon go home again, and I'll bring Kay with me. There's no use asking the flowers about him. They don't know anything except their own songs, and they haven't any news for me.\"\n\nThen she tucked up her little skirts so that she could run away faster, but the narcissus tapped against her leg as she was jumping over it. So she stopped and leaned over the tall flower.\n\n\"Perhaps you have something to tell me,\" she said.\n\nWhat did the narcissus say?\n\n\"I can see myself! I can see myself! Oh, how sweet is my own fragrance! Up in the narrow garret there is a little dancer, half dressed. First she stands on one leg. Then she stands on both, and kicks her heels at the whole world. She is an illusion of the stage. She pours water from the teapot over a piece of cloth she is holding-it is her bodice. Cleanliness is such a virtue! Her white dress hangs from a hook. It too has been washed in the teapot, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, and ties a saffron scarf around her neck to make the dress seem whiter. Point your toes! See how straight she balances on that single stem. I can see myself! I can see myself!\"\n\n\"I'm not interested,\" said Gerda. \"What a thing to tell me about!\"\n\nShe ran to the end of the garden, and though the gate was fastened she worked the rusty latch till it gave way and the gate flew open. Little Gerda scampered out into the wide world in her bare feet. She looked back three times, but nobody came after her. At last she could run no farther, and she sat down to rest on a big stone, and when she looked up she saw that summer had gone by, and it was late in the fall. She could never have guessed it inside the beautiful garden where the sun was always shining, and the flowers of every season were always in full bloom.\n\n\"Gracious! how long I've dallied,\" Gerda said. \"Fall is already here. I can't rest any longer.\"\n\nShe got up to run on, but how footsore and tired she was! And how cold and bleak everything around her looked! The long leaves of the willow tree had turned quite yellow, and damp puffs of mist dropped from them like drops of water. One leaf after another fell to the ground. Only the blackthorn still bore fruit, and its fruit was so sour that it set your teeth on edge.\n\nOh, how dreary and gray the wide world looked.\n\n------------\nFourth Story:\nThe Prince and the Princess\nThe next time that Gerda was forced to rest, a big crow came hopping across the snow in front of her. For a long time he had been watching her and cocking his head to one side, and now he said, \"Caw, caw! Good caw day!\" He could not say it any better, but he felt kindly inclined toward the little girl, and asked her where she was going in the great wide world, all alone. Gerda understood him when he said \"alone,\" and she knew its meaning all too well. She told the crow the whole story of her life, and asked if he hadn't seen Kay. The crow gravely nodded his head and cawed, \"Maybe I have, maybe I have!\"\n\n\"What! do you really think you have?\" the little girl cried, and almost hugged the crow to death as she kissed him.\n\n\"Gently, gently!\" said the crow. \"I think that it may have been little Kay that I saw, but if it was, then he has forgotten you for the Princess.\"\n\n\"Does he live with a Princess?\" Gerda asked.\n\n\"Yes. Listen!\" said the crow. \"But it is so hard for me to speak your language. If you understand crow talk, I can tell you much more easily.\"\n\n\"I don't know that language,\" said Gerda. \"My grandmother knows it, just as well as she knows baby talk, and I do wish I had learned it.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said the crow. \"I'll tell you as well as I can, though that won't be any too good.\" And he told her all that he knew.\n\n\"In the kingdom where we are now, there is a Princess who is uncommonly clever, and no wonder. She has read all the newspapers in the world and forgotten them again - that's how clever she is. Well, not long ago she was sitting on her throne. That's by no means as much fun as people suppose, so she fell to humming an old tune, and the refrain of it happened to run:\n\n\"Why, oh, why, shouldn't I get married?\"\n\" 'Why, that's an idea!' said she. And she made up her mind to marry as soon as she could find the sort of husband who could give a good answer when anyone spoke to him, instead of one of those fellows who merely stand around looking impressive, for that is so tiresome. She had the drums drubbed to call together all her ladies-in-waiting, and when they heard what she had in mind they were delighted.\n\n\" 'Oh, we like that!' they said. 'We were just thinking the very same thing.'\n\n\"Believe me,\" said the crow, \"every word I tell you is true. I have a tame ladylove who has the run of the palace, and I had the whole story straight from her.\" Of course his ladylove was also a crow, for birds of a feather will flock together.\n\n\"The newspapers immediately came out with a border of hearts and the initials of the Princess, and you could read an announcement that any presentable young man might go to the palace and talk with her. The one who spoke best, and who seemed most at home in the palace, would be chosen by the Princess as her husband.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the crow, \"believe me, that's as true as it is that here I sit. Men flocked to the palace, and there was much crowding and crushing, but on neither the first nor the second day was anyone chosen. Out in the street they were all glib talkers, but after they entered the palace gate where the guardsmen were stationed in their silver-braided uniforms, and after they climbed up the staircase lined with footmen in gold-embroidered livery, they arrived in the brilliantly lighted reception halls without a word to say. And when they stood in front of the Princess on her throne, the best they could do was to echo the last word of her remarks, and she didn't care to hear it repeated.\n\n\"It was just as if everyone in the throne room had his stomach filled with snuff and had fallen asleep; for as soon as they were back in the streets there was no stopping their talk.\n\n\"The line of candidates extended all the way from the town gates to the palace. I saw them myself,\" said the crow. \"They got hungry and they got thirsty, but from the palace they got nothing-not even a glass of lukewarm water. To be sure, some of the clever candidates had brought sandwiches with them, but they did not share them with their neighbors. Each man thought, 'Just let him look hungry, then the Princess won't take him!' \"\n\n\"But Kay, little Kay,\" Gerda interrupted, \"when did he come? Was he among those people?\"\n\n\"Give me time, give me time! We are just coming to him. On the third day a little person, with neither horse nor carriage, strode boldly up to the palace. His eyes sparkled the way yours do, and he had handsome long hair, but his clothes were poor.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was Kay!\" Gerda said, and clapped her hands in glee. \"Now I've found him.\"\n\n\"He had a little knapsack on his back,\" the crow told her.\n\n\"No, that must have been his sled,\" said Gerda. \"He was carrying it when he went away.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" the crow said. \"I didn't look at it carefully. But my tame ladylove told me that when he went through the palace gates and saw the guardsmen in silver, and on the staircase the footmen in gold, he wasn't at all taken aback. He nodded and he said to them:\n\n\" 'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs. I'd rather go inside.'\n\n\"The halls were brilliantly lighted. Ministers of state and privy councilors were walking about barefooted, carrying golden trays in front of them. It was enough to make anyone feel solemn, and his boots creaked dreadfully, but he wasn't a bit afraid.\"\n\n\"That certainly must have been Kay,\" said Gerda. \"I know he was wearing new boots. I heard them creaking in Grandmother's room.\"\n\n\"Oh, they creaked all right,\" said the crow. \"But it was little enough he cared as he walked straight to the Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as big as a spinning wheel. All the ladies-in-waiting with their attendants and their attendants' attendants, and all the lords-in-waiting with their gentlemen and their gentlemen's men, each of whom had his page with him, were standing there, and the nearer they stood to the door the more arrogant they looked. The gentlemen's men's pages, who always wore slippers, were almost too arrogant to look as they stood at the threshold.\"\n\n\"That must have been terrible!\" little Gerda exclaimed. \"And yet Kay won the Princess?\"\n\n\"If I weren't a crow, I would have married her myself, for all that I'm engaged to another. They say he spoke as well as I do when I speak my crow language. Or so my tame ladylove tells me. He was dashing and handsome, and he was not there to court the Princess but to hear her wisdom. This he liked, and she liked him.\"\n\n\"Of course it was Kay,\" said Gerda. \"He was so clever that he could do mental arithmetic even with fractions. Oh, please take me to the palace.\"\n\n\"That's easy enough to say,\" said the crow, \"but how can we manage it? I'll talk it over with my tame ladylove, and she may be able to suggest something, but I must warn you that a little girl like you will never be admitted.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes I shall,\" said Gerda. \"When Kay hears about me, he will come out to fetch me at once.\"\n\n\"Wait for me beside that stile,\" the crow said. He wagged his head and off he flew.\n\nDarkness had set in when he got back.\n\n\"Caw, caw!\" he said. \"My ladylove sends you her best wishes, and here's a little loaf of bread for you. She found it in the kitchen, where they have all the bread they need, and you must be hungry. You simply can't get into the palace with those bare feet. The guardsmen in silver and the footmen in gold would never permit it. But don't you cry. We'll find a way. My ladylove knows of a little back staircase that leads up to the bedroom, and she knows where they keep the key to it.\"\n\nThen they went into the garden and down the wide promenade where the leaves were falling one by one. When, one by one, the lights went out in the palace, the crow led little Gerda to the back door, which stood ajar.\n\nOh, how her heart did beat with fear and longing. It was just as if she were about to do something wrong, yet she only wanted to make sure that this really was little Kay. Yes, truly it must be Kay, she thought, as she recalled his sparkling eyes and his long hair. She remembered exactly how he looked when he used to smile at her as they sat under the roses at home. Wouldn't he be glad to see her! Wouldn't he be interested in hearing how far she had come to find him, and how sad they had all been when he didn't come home. She was so frightened, and yet so happy.\n\nNow they were on the stairway. A little lamp was burning on a cupboard, and there stood the tame crow, cocking her head to look at Gerda, who made the curtsy that her grandmother had taught her.\n\n\"My fiancé has told me many charming things about you, dear young lady,\" she said. \"Your biography, as one might say, is very touching. Kindly take the lamp and I shall lead the way. We shall keep straight ahead, where we aren't apt to run into anyone.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that someone is on the stairs behind us,\" said Gerda. Things brushed past, and from the shadows on the wall they seemed to be horses with spindly legs and waving manes. And there were shadows of huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen, on horseback.\n\n\"Those are only dreams,\" said the crow. \"They come to take the thoughts of their royal masters off to the chase. That's just as well, for it will give you a good opportunity to see them while they sleep. But I trust that, when you rise to high position and power, you will show a grateful heart.\"\n\n\"Tut tut! You've no need to say that,\" said the forest crow.\n\nNow they entered the first room. It was hung with rose-colored satin, embroidered with flowers. The dream shadows were flitting by so fast that Gerda could not see the lords and ladies. Hall after magnificent hall quite bewildered her, until at last they reached the royal bedroom.\n\nThe ceiling of it was like the top of a huge palm tree, with leaves of glass, costly glass. In the middle of the room two beds hung from a massive stem of gold. Each of them looked like a lily. One bed was white, and there lay the Princess. The other was red, and there Gerda hoped to find little Kay. She bent one of the scarlet petals and saw the nape of a little brown neck. Surely this must be Kay. She called his name aloud and held the lamp near him. The dreams on horseback pranced into the room again, as he awoke-and turned his head-and it was not little Kay at all.\n\nThe Prince only resembled Kay about the neck, but he was young and handsome. The Princess peeked out of her lily-white bed, and asked what had happened. Little Gerda cried and told them all about herself, and about all that the crows had done for her.\n\n\"Poor little thing,\" the Prince and the Princess said. They praised the crows, and said they weren't the least bit angry with them, but not to do it again. Furthermore, they should have a reward.\n\n\"Would you rather fly about without any responsibilities,\" said the Princess, \"or would you care to be appointed court crows for life, with rights to all scraps from the kitchen?\"\n\nBoth the crows bowed low and begged for permanent office, for they thought of their future and said it was better to provide for their \"old age,\" as they called it.\n\nThe Prince got up, and let Gerda have his bed. It was the utmost that he could do. She clasped her little hands and thought, \"How nice the people and the birds are.\" She closed her eyes, fell peacefully asleep, and all the dreams came flying back again. They looked like angels, and they drew a little sled on which Kay sat. He nodded to her, but this was only in a dream, so it all disappeared when she woke up.\n\nThe next day she was dressed from her head to her heels in silk and in velvet too. They asked her to stay at the palace and have a nice time there, but instead she begged them to let her have a little carriage, a little horse, and a pair of little boots, so that she could drive out into the wide world to find Kay.\n\nThey gave her a pair of boots, and also a muff. They dressed her as nicely as could be and, when she was ready to go, there at the gate stood a brand new carriage of pure gold. On it the coat of arms of the Prince and the Princess glistened like a star.\n\nThe coachman, the footman, and the postilions-for postilions there were-all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the Princess themselves helped her into the carriage, and wished her Godspeed. The forest crow, who was now a married man, accompanied her for the first three miles, and sat beside Gerda, for it upset him to ride backward. The other crow stood beside the gate and waved her wings. She did not accompany them because she was suffering from a headache, brought on by eating too much in her new position. Inside, the carriage was lined with sugared cookies, and the seats were filled with fruit and gingerbread.\n\n\"Fare you well, fare you well,\" called the Prince and Princess. Little Gerda cried and the crow cried too, for the first few miles. Then the crow said good-by, and that was the saddest leave-taking of all. He flew up into a tree and waved his big black wings as long as he could see the carriage, which flashed as brightly as the sun.\n\n------------\nFifth Story:\nThe Little Robber Girl\nThe carriage rolled on into a dark forest. Like a blazing torch, it shone in the eyes of some robbers. They could not bear it.\n\n\"That's gold! That's gold!\" they cried. They sprang forward, seized the horses, killed the little postilions, the coachman, and the footman, and dragged little Gerda out of the carriage.\n\n\"How plump and how tender she looks, just as if she'd been fattened on nuts!\" cried the old robber woman, who had a long bristly beard, and long eyebrows that hung down over her eyes. \"She looks like a fat little lamb. What a dainty dish she will be!\" As she said this she drew out her knife, a dreadful, flashing thing.\n\n\"Ouch!\" the old woman howled. At just that moment her own little daughter had bitten her ear. The little girl, whom she carried on her back, was a wild and reckless creature. \"You beasty brat!\" her mother exclaimed, but it kept her from using that knife on Gerda.\n\n\"She shall play with me,\" said the little robber girl. \"She must give me her muff and that pretty dress she wears, and sleep with me in my bed.\" And she again gave her mother such a bite that the woman hopped and whirled around in pain. All the robbers laughed, and shouted:\n\n\"See how she dances with her brat.\"\n\n\"I want to ride in the carriage,\" the little robber girl said, and ride she did, for she was too spoiled and headstrong for words. She and Gerda climbed into the carriage and away they drove over stumps and stones, into the depths of the forest. The little robber girl was no taller than Gerda, but she was stronger and much broader in the shoulders. Her skin was brown and her eyes coal-black-almost sad in their expression. She put her arms around Gerda, and said:\n\n\"They shan't kill you unless I get angry with you. I think you must be a Princess.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" said little Gerda. And she told about all that had happened to her, and how much she cared for little Kay. The robber girl looked at her gravely, gave a little nod of approval, and told her:\n\n\"Even if I should get angry with you, they shan't kill you, because I'll do it myself!\" Then she dried Gerda's eyes, and stuck her own hands into Gerda's soft, warm muff.\n\nThe carriage stopped at last, in the courtyard of a robber's castle. The walls of it were cracked from bottom to top. Crows and ravens flew out of every loophole, and bulldogs huge enough to devour a man jumped high in the air. But they did not bark, for that was forbidden.\n\nIn the middle of the stone-paved, smoky old hall, a big fire was burning. The smoke of it drifted up to the ceiling, where it had to find its own way out. Soup was boiling in a big caldron, and hares and rabbits were roasting on the spit.\n\n\"Tonight you shall sleep with me and all my little animals,\" the robber girl said. After they had something to eat and drink, they went over to a corner that was strewn with rugs and straw. On sticks and perches around the bedding roosted nearly a hundred pigeons. They seemed to be asleep, but they stirred just a little when the two little girls came near them.\n\n\"They are all mine, \" said the little robber girl. She seized the one that was nearest to her, held it by the legs and shook it until it flapped its wings. \"Kiss it,\" she cried, and thrust the bird in Gerda's face. \"Those two are the wild rascals,\" she said, pointing high up the wall to a hole barred with wooden sticks. \"Rascals of the woods they are, and they would fly away in a minute if they were not locked up.\"\n\n\"And here is my old sweetheart, Bae,\" she said, pulling at the horns of a reindeer that was tethered by a shiny copper ring around his neck. \"We have to keep a sharp eye on him, or he would run away from us too. Every single night I tickle his neck with my knife blade, for he is afraid of that.\" From a hole in the wall she pulled a long knife, and rubbed it against the reindeer's neck. After the poor animal had kicked up its heals, the robber girl laughed and pulled Gerda down into the bed with her.\n\n\"Are you going to keep that knife in bed with you?\" Gerda asked, and looked at it a little frightened.\n\n\"I always sleep with my knife,\" the little robber girl said. \"You never can tell what may happen. But let's hear again what you told me before about little Kay, and about why you are wandering through the wide world.\"\n\nGerda told the story all over again, while the wild pigeons cooed in their cage overhead, and the tame pigeons slept. The little robber girl clasped one arm around Gerda's neck, gripped her knife in the other hand, fell asleep, and snored so that one could hear her. But Gerda could not close her eyes at all. She did not know whether she was to live or whether she was to die. The robbers sat around their fire, singing and drinking, and the old robber woman was turning somersaults. It was a terrible sight for a little girl to see.\n\nThen the wood pigeons said, \"Coo, coo. We have seen little Kay. A white hen was carrying his sled, and Kay sat in the Snow Queen's sleigh. They swooped low, over the trees where we lay in our nest. The Snow Queen blew upon us, and all the young pigeons died except us. Coo, coo.\"\n\n\"What is that you are saying up there?\" cried Gerda. \"Where was the Snow Queen going? Do you know anything about it?\"\n\n\"She was probably bound for Lapland, where they always have snow and ice. Why don't you ask the reindeer who is tethered beside you?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is ice and snow in that glorious land,\" the reindeer told her. \"You can prance about freely across those great, glittering fields. The Snow Queen has her summer tent there, but her stronghold is a castle up nearer the North Pole, on the island called Spitzbergen.\"\n\n\"Oh, Kay, little Kay,\" Gerda sighed.\n\n\"Lie still,\" said the robber girl, \"or I'll stick my knife in your stomach.\"\n\nIn the morning Gerda told her all that the wood pigeons had said. The little robber girl looked quite thoughtful. She nodded her head, and exclaimed, \"Leave it to me! Leave it to me.\n\n\"Do you know where Lapland is?\" she asked the reindeer.\n\n\"Who knows it better than I?\" the reindeer said, and his eyes sparkled. \"There I was born, there I was bred, and there I kicked my heels in freedom, across the fields of snow.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" the robber girl said to Gerda. \"As you see, all the men are away. Mother is still here, and here she'll stay, but before the morning is over she will drink out of that big bottle, and then she usually dozes off for a nap. As soon as that happens, I will do you a good turn.\"\n\nShe jumped out of bed, rushed over and threw her arms around her mother's neck, pulled at her beard bristles, and said, \"Good morning, my dear nanny-goat.\" Her mother thumped her nose until it was red and blue, but all that was done out of pure love.\n\nAs soon as the mother had tipped up the bottle and dozed off to sleep, the little robber girl ran to the reindeer and said, \"I have a good notion to keep you here, and tickle you with my sharp knife. You are so funny when I do, but never mind that. I'll untie your rope, and help you find your way outside, so that you can run back to Lapland. But you must put your best leg forward and carry this little girl to the Snow Queen's palace, where her playmate is. I suppose you heard what she told me, for she spoke so loud, and you were eavesdropping.\"\n\nThe reindeer was so happy that he bounded into the air. The robber girl hoisted little Gerda on his back, carefully tied her in place, and even gave her a little pillow to sit on. I don't do things half way,\" she said. \"Here, take back your fur boots, for it's going to be bitter cold. I'll keep your muff, because it's such a pretty one. But your fingers mustn't get cold. Here are my mother's big mittens, which will come right up to your elbows. Pull them on. Now your hands look just like my ugly mother's big paws.\"\n\nAnd Gerda shed happy tears.\n\n\"I don't care to see you blubbering,\" said the little robber girl. \"You ought to look pleased now. Here, take these two loaves of bread and this ham along, so that you won't starve.\"\n\nWhen these provisions were tied on the back of the reindeer, the little robber girl opened the door and called in all the big dogs. Then she cut the tether with her knife and said to the reindeer, \"Now run, but see that you take good care of the little girl.\"\n\nGerda waved her big mittens to the little robber girl, and said good-by. then the reindeer bounded away, over stumps and stones, straight through the great forest, over swamps and across the plains, as fast as he could run. The wolves howled, the ravens shrieked, and ker-shew, ker-shew! the red streaks of light ripped through the heavens, with a noise that sounded like sneezing.\n\n\"Those are my old Northern Lights,\" said the reindeer. \"See how they flash.\" And on he ran, faster than ever, by night and day. The loaves were eaten and the whole ham was eaten-and there they were in Lapland.\n\n------------\nSixth Story:\nThe Lapp Woman and the Finn Woman\nThey stopped in front of the little hut, and a makeshift dwelling it was. The roof of it almost touched the ground, and the doorway was so low that the family had to lie on their stomachs to crawl in it or out of it. No one was at home except an old Lapp woman, who was cooking fish over a whale-oil lamp. The reindeer told her Gerda's whole story, but first he told his own, which he thought was much more important. Besides, Gerda was so cold that she couldn't say a thing.\n\n\"Oh, you poor creatures,\" the Lapp woman said, \"you've still got such a long way to go. Why, you will have to travel hundreds of miles into the Finmark. For it's there that the Snow Queen is taking a country vacation, and burning her blue fireworks every evening. I'll jot down a message on a dried codfish, for I haven't any paper. I want you to take it to the Finn woman who lives up there. She will be able to tell you more about it than I can.\"\n\nAs soon as Gerda had thawed out, and had had something to eat and drink, the Lapp woman wrote a few words on a dried codfish, told Gerda to take good care of it, and tied her again on the back of the reindeer. Off he ran, and all night long the skies crackled and swished as the most beautiful Northern Lights flashed over their heads. At last they came to the Finmark, and knocked at the Finn woman's chimney, for she hadn't a sign of a door. It was so hot inside that the Finn woman went about almost naked. She was small and terribly dowdy, but she at once helped little Gerda off with her mittens and boots, and loosened her clothes. Otherwise the heat would have wilted her. Then the woman put a piece of ice on the reindeer's head, and read what was written on the codfish. She read it three times and when she knew it by heart, she put the fish into the kettle of soup, for they might as well eat it. She never wasted anything.\n\nThe reindeer told her his own story first, and then little Gerda's. The Finn woman winked a knowing eye, but she didn't say anything.\n\n\"You are such a wise woman,\" said the reindeer, \"I know that you can tie all the winds of the world together with a bit of cotton thread. If the sailor unties one knot he gets a favorable wind. If he unties another he gets a stiff gale, while if he unties the third and fourth knots such a tempest rages that it flattens the trees in the forest. Won't you give this little girl something to drink that will make her as strong as twelve men, so that she may overpower the Snow Queen?\"\n\n\"Twelve strong men,\" the Finn woman sniffed. \" Much good that would be.\"\n\nShe went to the shelf, took down a big rolled-up skin, and unrolled it. On this skin strange characters were written, and the Finn woman read them until the sweat rolled down her forehead.\n\nThe reindeer again begged her to help Gerda, and little Gerda looked at her with such tearful, imploring eyes, that the woman began winking again. She took the reindeer aside in a corner, and while she was putting another piece of ice on his head she whispered to him:\n\n\"Little Kay is indeed with the Snow Queen, and everything there just suits him fine. He thinks it is the best place in all the world, but that's because he has a splinter of glass in his heart and a small piece of it in his eye. Unless these can be gotten out, he will never be human again, and the Snow Queen will hold him in her power.\"\n\n\"But can't you fix little Gerda something to drink which will give her more power than all those things?\"\n\n\"No power that I could give could be as great as that which she already has. Don't you see how men and beasts are compelled to serve her, and how far she has come in the wide world since she started out in her naked feet? We mustn't tell her about this power. Strength lies in her heart, because she is such a sweet, innocent child. If she herself cannot reach the Snow Queen and rid little Kay of those pieces of glass, then there's no help that we can give her. The Snow Queen's garden lies about eight miles from here. You may carry the little girl there, and put her down by the big bush covered with red berries that grows on the snow. Then don't you stand there gossiping, but hurry to get back here.\"?\n\nThe Finn woman lifted little Gerda onto the reindeer, and he galloped away as fast as he could.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Gerda, \"I forgot my boots and I forgot my mittens.\" She soon felt the need of them in that knife-like cold, but the reindeer did not dare to stop. He galloped on until they came to the big bush that was covered with red berries. Here he set Gerda down and kissed her on the mouth, while big shining tears ran down his face. Then he ran back as fast as he could. Little Gerda stood there without boots and without mittens, right in the middle of icy Finmark.\n\nShe ran as fast as ever she could. A whole regiment of snowflakes swirled toward her, but they did not fall from the sky, for there was not a cloud up there, and the Northern Lights were ablaze.\n\nThe flakes skirmished along the ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda remembered how large and strange they had appeared when she looked at them under the magnifying glass. But here they were much more monstrous and terrifying. They were alive. They were the Snow Queen's advance guard, and their shapes were most strange. Some looked like ugly, overgrown porcupines. Some were like a knot of snakes that stuck out their heads in every direction, and others were like fat little bears with every hair a-bristle. All of them were glistening white, for all were living snowflakes.\n\nIt was so cold that, as little Gerda said the Lord's Prayer, she could see her breath freezing in front of her mouth, like a cloud of smoke. It grew thicker and thicker, and took the shape of little angels that grew bigger and bigger the moment they touched the ground. All of them had helmets on their heads and they carried shields and lances in their hands. Rank upon rank, they increased, and when Gerda had finished her prayer she was surrounded by a legion of angels. They struck the dread snowflakes with their lances and shivered them into a thousand pieces. Little Gerda walked on, unmolested and cheerful. The angels rubbed her hands and feet to make them warmer, and she trotted briskly along to the Snow Queen's palace.\n\nBut now let us see how little Kay was getting on. Little Gerda was furthest from his mind, and he hadn't the slightest idea that she was just outside the palace.\n\n------------\nSeventh Story:\nWhat Happened in The Snow Queen's Palace\nand\nWhat Came of it\nThe walls of the palace were driven snow. The windows and doors were the knife-edged wind. There were more than a hundred halls, shaped as the snow had drifted, and the largest of these extended for many a mile. All were lighted by the flare of the Northern Lights. All of the halls were so immense and so empty, so brilliant and so glacial! There was never a touch of gaiety in them; never so much as a little dance for the polar bears, at which the storm blast could have served for music, and the polar bears could have waddled about on their hind legs to show off their best manners. There was never a little party with such games as blind-bear's buff or hide the paw-kerchief for the cubs, nor even a little afternoon coffee over which the white fox vixens could gossip. Empty, vast, and frigid were the Snow Queen's halls. The Northern Lights flared with such regularity that you could time exactly when they would be at the highest and lowest. In the middle of the vast, empty hall of snow was a frozen lake. It was cracked into a thousand pieces, but each piece was shaped so exactly like the others that it seemed a work of wonderful craftsmanship. The Snow Queen sat in the exact center of it when she was at home, and she spoke of this as sitting on her \"Mirror of Reason.\" She said this mirror was the only one of its kind, and the best thing in all the world.\n\nLittle Kay was blue, yes, almost black, with the cold. But he did not feel it, because the Snow Queen had kissed away his icy tremblings, and his heart itself had almost turned to ice.\n\nHe was shifting some sharp, flat pieces of ice to and fro, trying to fit them into every possible pattern, for he wanted to make something with them. It was like the Chinese puzzle game that we play at home, juggling little flat pieces of wood about into special designs. Kay was cleverly arranging his pieces in the game of ice-cold reason. To him the patterns were highly remarkable and of the utmost importance, for the chip of glass in his eye made him see them that way. He arranged his pieces to spell out many words; but he could never find the way to make the one word he was so eager to form. The word was \"Eternity.\" The Snow Queen had said to him, \"If you can puzzle that out you shall be your own master, and I'll give you the whole world and a new pair of skates.\" But he could not puzzle it out.\n\n\"Now I am going to make a flying trip to the warm countries,\" the Snow Queen told him. \"I want to go and take a look into the black caldrons.\" She meant the volcanos of Etna and Vesuvius. \"I must whiten them up a bit. They need it, and it will be such a relief after all those yellow lemons and purple grapes.\"\n\nAnd away she flew. Kay sat all alone in that endless, empty, frigid hall, and puzzled over the pieces of ice until he almost cracked his skull. He sat so stiff and still that one might have thought he was frozen to death.\n\nAll of a sudden, little Gerda walked up to the palace through the great gate which was a knife-edged wind. But Gerda said her evening prayer. The wind was lulled to rest, and the little girl came on into the vast, cold, empty hall. Then she saw Kay. She recognized him at once, and ran to throw her arms around him. She held him close and cried, \"Kay, dearest little Kay! I've found you at last!\"\n\nBut he sat still, and stiff, and cold. Gerda shed hot tears, and when they fell upon him they went straight to his heart. They melted the lump of ice and burned away the splinter of glass in it. He looked up at her, and she sang:\n\n\"Where roses bloom so sweetly in the vale,\nThere shall you find the Christ Child, without fail.\"\nKay burst into tears. He cried so freely that the little piece of glass in his eye was washed right out. \"Gerda!\" He knew her, and cried out in his happiness, \"My sweet little Gerda, where have you been so long? And where have I been?\" He looked around him and said, \"How cold it is here! How enormous and empty!\" He held fast to Gerda, who laughed until happy tears rolled down her cheeks. Their bliss was so heavenly that even the bits of glass danced about them and shared in their happiness. When the pieces grew tired, they dropped into a pattern which made the very word that the Snow Queen had told Kay he must find before he became his own master and received the whole world and a new pair of skates.\n\nGerda kissed his cheeks, and they turned pink again. She kissed his eyes, and they sparkled like hers. She kissed his hands and feet, and he became strong and well. The Snow Queen might come home now whenever she pleased, for there stood the order for Kay's release, written in letters of shining ice.\n\nHand in hand, Kay and Gerda strolled out of that enormous palace. They talked about Grandmother, and about the roses on their roof. Wherever they went, the wind died down and the sun shone out. When they came to the bush that was covered with red berries, the reindeer was waiting to meet them. He had brought along a young reindeer mate who had warm milk for the children to drink, and who kissed them on the mouth. Then these reindeer carried Gerda and Kay first to the Finn woman. They warmed themselves in her hot room, and when she had given them directions for their journey home they rode on to the Lapp woman. She had made them new clothes, and was ready to take them along in her sleigh.\n\nSide by side, the reindeer ran with them to the limits of the North country, where the first green buds were to be seen. Here they said good-by to the two reindeer and to the Lapp woman. \"Farewell,\" they all said.\n\nNow the first little birds began to chirp, and there were green buds all around them in the forest. Through the woods came riding a young girl on a magnificent horse that Gerda recognized, for it had once been harnessed to the golden carriage. The girl wore a bright red cap on her head, and a pair of pistols in her belt. She was the little robber girl, who had grown tired of staying at home, and who was setting out on a journey to the North country. If she didn't like it there, why, the world was wide, and there were many other places where she could go. She recognized Gerda at once, and Gerda knew her too. It was a happy meeting.\n\n\"You're a fine one for gadding about,\" she told little Kay. \"I'd just like to know whether you deserve to have someone running to the end of the earth for your sake.\"\n\nBut Gerda patted her cheek and asked her about the Prince and the Princess.\n\n\"They are traveling in foreign lands,\" the girl told her.\n\n\"And the crow?\"\n\n\"Oh, the crow is dead,\" she answered. \"His tame ladylove is now a widow, and she wears a bit of black wool wrapped around her leg. She takes great pity on herself, but that's all stuff and nonsense. Now tell me what has happened to you and how you caught up with Kay.\"\n\nGerda and Kay told her their story.\n\n\"Snip snap snurre, basse lurre,\" said the robber girl. \"So everything came out all right.\" She shook them by the hand, and promised that if ever she passed through their town she would come to see them. And then she rode away.\n\nKay and Gerda held each other by the hand. And as they walked along they had wonderful spring weather. The land was green and strewn with flowers, church bells rang, and they saw the high steeples of a big town. It was the one where they used to live. They walked straight to Grandmother's house, and up the stairs, and into the room, where everything was just as it was when they left it. And the clock said tick-tock, and its hands were telling the time. But the moment they came in the door they noticed one change. They were grown-up now.\n\nThe roses on the roof looked in at the open window, and their two little stools were still out there. Kay and Gerda sat down on them, and held each other by the hand. Both of them had forgotten the icy, empty splendor of the Snow Queen's palace as completely as if it were some bad dream. Grandmother sat in God's good sunshine, reading to them from her Bible:\n\n\"Except ye become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n\nKay and Gerda looked into each other's eyes, and at last they understood the meaning of their old hymn:\n\n\"Where roses bloom so sweetly in the vale,\nThere shall you find the Christ Child, without fail.\"\nAnd they sat there, grown-up, but children still-children at heart. And it was summer, warm, glorious summer."

      "body": "Fundevogel:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a forester. He went into the woods to hunt, and after entering the woods he heard a sound of crying, as though it were a little child. Following the sound, he finally came to a tall tree, at the top of which a little child was sitting. His mother had fallen asleep under the tree with the child. A bird of prey had seen him in her arms, flown down, picked him up in its beak, and then set him on the tall tree.\n\nThe forester climbed the tree, brought the child down, and thought, \"I will take the child home with me, and bring him up with my Lenchen.\"\n\nSo he took him home, and the two children grew up together. The child whom he had found on the tree was called Foundling-Bird, because a bird had carried him away. Foundling-Bird and Lenchen loved each other so much, ever so much, that whenever they did not see one another they were sad.\n\nNow the forester had an old cook. One evening she took two buckets and began to fetch water. She did not go out to the well just once, but many times.\n\nLenchen saw this and said, \"Listen, old Sanna, why are you fetching so much water?\"\n\n\"If you won't tell anyone, I will tell you.\"\n\nSo Lenchen said that she would not tell anyone, and then the cook said, \"Early tomorrow morning when the forester is out hunting I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle I will throw Foundling-Bird into it and cook him.\n\nThe forester got up very early the next morning and went out hunting. When he left, the children were still in bed.\n\nThen Lenchen said to Foundling-Bird, \"If you will never leave me, I will never leave you either.\"\n\nFoundling-Bird said, \"Never, ever.\"\n\nThen Lenchen said, \"Then I will tell you that last night old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that. She said that if I would not tell anyone she would tell me. I said that I would be sure not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would boil a kettle full of water, throw you into it, and cook you. But let us hurry and get up, get dressed, and run away together.\n\nSo the two children got up, hurriedly got dressed, and went away.\n\nWhen the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to get Foundling-Bird and throw him into it. But when she went to their room and to their beds, both the children were gone.\n\nThen she became terribly frightened and said to herself, \"What will I say when the forester comes home and sees that the children are gone. I must hurry and follow them and get them back again.\"\n\nThen the cook sent out three servants who were to run after the children and bring them back. The children were sitting at the edge of the woods when they saw the three servants running toward them from afar.\n\nLenchen said to Foundling-Bird, \"Never leave me, and I will never leave you.\"\n\nFoundling-Bird said, \"Never, ever.\"\n\nThen Lenchen said, \"You, turn into a rosebush, and I to a rose on it.\"\n\nWhen the three servants reached the edge of the woods nothing was there but a rosebush with one rose on it, but the children were nowhere.\"\n\nThen they said, \"There is nothing to be done here,\" and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing out there but a little rosebush with one rose on it.\n\nThen the old cook scolded them, saying, \"You simpletons, you should have cut the rosebush in two and then broken off the rose and brought it home with you. Hurry up and do it.\"\n\nSo they had to go out and look for the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from afar.\n\nLenchen said, \"Foundling-Bird, never leave me, and I will never leave you.\"\n\nFoundling-Bird said, \"Never, ever.\"\n\nLenchen said, \"You, turn into a church, and I to the chandelier in it.\"\n\nWhen the three servants arrived, nothing was there but a church with a chandelier in it. So they said to one another, \"What can we do here? Let us go home.\"\n\nWhen they reached home, the cook asked if they had found them, and they said that they had found nothing but a church with a chandelier in it.\n\nThe cook scolded them, saying, \"You fools, why didn't you break down the church and bring the chandelier home with you?\"\n\nThis time the old cook herself got up and with the three servants went out after the children.\n\nThe children, however, saw from afar that the three servants were coming, with the cook tottering after them.\n\nThen Lenchen said, \"Foundling-Bird, never leave me, and I will never leave you.\"\n\nFoundling-Bird said, \"Never, ever.\"\n\nLenchen said, \"Turn into a pond, and I to a duck upon it.\"\n\nThe cook came up to them, and when she saw the pond she leaned out over it and was about to drink it up. But the duck quickly came swimming toward her, took hold of her head with its beak, and pulled her into the water, where the old witch drowned.\n\nThen the children went home together, and were very happy, and if they have not died, they are still alive."

He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.\n\nOne evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.\n\nIt was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.\n\nWell, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.\n\nOn this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.\n\nOh, very badly! said she. I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. Its horrible!\n\nNow they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.\n\nNobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.\n\nSo the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.\n\nThere, that is a true story."

      "body": "Ozma and the Little Wizard:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived in the beautiful Emerald City, which lies in the center of the fairy Land of Oz, a lovely girl called Princess Ozma, who was ruler of all that country. And among those who served this girlish Ruler and lived in a cozy suite of rooms in her splendid palace, was a little, withered old man known as the Wizard of Oz.\n\n This little Wizard could do a good many queer things in magic; but he was a kind man, with merry, twinkling eyes and a sweet smile; so, instead of fearing him because of his magic, everybody loved him.\n\nNow, Ozma was very anxious that all her people who inhabited the pleasant Land of Oz should be happy and contented, and therefore she decided one morning to make a journey to all parts of the country, that she might discover if anything was amiss, or anyone discontented, or if there was any wrong that ought to be righted. She asked the little Wizard to accompany her and he was glad to go.\n\n“Shall I take my bag of magic tools with me?” he asked.\n\n“Of course,” said Ozma. “We may need a lot of magic before we return, for we are going into strange corners of the land, where we may meet with unknown creatures and dangerous adventures.”\n\nSo the Wizard took his bag of magic tools and the two left the Emerald City and wandered over the country for many days, at last reaching a place far up in the mountains which neither of them had ever visited before. Stopping one morning at a cottage, built beside the rocky path which led into a pretty valley beyond, Ozma asked a man:\n\n“Are you happy? Have you any complaint to make of your lot?”\n\nAnd the man replied:\n\n“We are happy except for three mischievous Imps that live in yonder valley and often come here to annoy us. If your Highness would only drive away those Imps, I and my family would be very happy and very grateful to you.”\n\n“Who are these bad Imps?” inquired the girl Ruler.\n\n“One is named Olite, and one Udent and one Ertinent, and they have no respect for anyone or anything. If strangers pass through the valley the Imps jeer at them and make horrid faces and call names, and often they push travelers out of the path or throw stones at them. Whenever Imp Olite or Imp Udent or Imp Ertinent comes here to bother us, I and my family run into the house and lock all the doors and windows, and we dare not venture out again until the Imps have gone away.”\n\nPrincess Ozma was grieved to hear this report and the little Wizard shook his head gravely and said the naughty Imps deserved to be punished. They told the good man they would see what could be done to protect him and at once entered the valley to seek the dwelling place of the three mischievous creatures.\n\nBefore long they came upon three caves, hollowed from the rocks, and in front of each cave squatted a queer little dwarf. Ozma and the Wizard paused to examine them and found them well-shaped, strong and lively. They had big round ears, flat noses and wide grinning mouths, and their jet-black hair came to points on top of their heads, much resembling horns. Their clothing fitted snugly to their bodies and limbs and the Imps were so small in size that at first Ozma did not consider them at all dangerous. But one of them suddenly reached out a hand and caught the dress of the Princess, jerking it so sharply that she nearly fell down, and a moment later another Imp pushed the little Wizard so hard that he bumped against Ozma and both unexpectedly sat down upon the ground.\nAt this the Imps laughed boisterously and began running around in a circle and kicking dust upon the Royal Princess, who cried in a sharp voice: “Wizard, do your duty!”\n\nThe Wizard promptly obeyed. Without rising from the ground he opened his bag, got the tools he required and muttered a magic spell.\n\nInstantly the three Imps became three bushes—of a thorny stubby kind—with their roots in the ground. As the bushes were at first motionless, perhaps through surprise at their sudden transformation, the Wizard and the Princess found time to rise from the ground and brush the dust off their pretty clothes. Then Ozma turned to the bushes and said:\n\n“The unhappy lot you now endure, my poor Imps, is due entirely to your naughty actions. You can no longer annoy harmless travelers and you must remain ugly bushes, covered with sharp thorns, until you repent of your bad ways and promise to be good Imps.”\n\n“They can’t help being good now, your Highness,” said the Wizard, who was much pleased with his work, “and the safest plan will be to allow them always to remain bushes.”\n\nBut something must have been wrong with the Wizard’s magic, or the creatures had magic of their own, for no sooner were the words spoken than the bushes began to move. At first they only waved their branches at the girl and little man, but pretty soon they began to slide over the ground, their roots dragging through the earth, and one pushed itself against the Wizard and pricked him so sharply with its thorns that he cried out: “Ouch!” and started to run away.\n\nOzma followed, for the other bushes were trying to stick their thorns into her legs and one actually got so near her that it tore a great rent in her beautiful dress. The girl Princess could run, however, and she followed the fleeing Wizard until he tumbled head first over a log and rolled upon the ground. Then she sprang behind a tree and shouted: “Quick! Transform them into something else.”\nThe Wizard heard, but he was much confused by his fall. Grabbing from his bag the first magical tool he could find he transformed the bushes into three white pigs. That astonished the Imps. In the shape of pigs—fat, roly-poly and cute—they scampered off a little distance and sat down to think about their new condition.\n\nOzma drew a long breath and coming from behind the tree she said:\n\n“That is much better, Wiz, for such pigs as these must be quite harmless. No one need now fear the mischievous Imps.”\n\n“I intended to transform them into mice,” replied the Wizard, “but in my excitement I worked the wrong magic. However, unless the horrid creatures behave themselves hereafter, they are liable to be killed and eaten. They would make good chops, sausages or roasts.”\n\nBut the Imps were now angry and had no intention of behaving. As Ozma and the little Wizard turned to resume their journey, the three pigs rushed forward, dashed between their legs, and tripped them up, so that both lost their balance and toppled over, clinging to one another. As the Wizard tried to get up he was tripped again and fell across the back of the third pig, which carried him on a run far down the valley until it dumped the little man in the river. Ozma had been sprawled upon the ground but found she was not hurt, so she picked herself up and ran to the assistance of the Wizard, reaching him just as he was crawling out of the river, gasping for breath and dripping with water. The girl could not help laughing at his woeful appearance. But he had no sooner wiped the wet from his eyes than one of the impish pigs tripped him again and sent him into the river for a second bath. The pigs tried to trip Ozma, too, but she ran around a stump and so managed to keep out of their way. So the Wizard scrambled out of the water again and picked up a sharp stick to defend himself. Then he mumbled a magic mutter which instantly dried his clothes, after which he hurried to assist Ozma. The pigs were afraid of the sharp stick and kept away from it.\n“This won’t do,” said the Princess. “We have accomplished nothing, for the pig Imps would annoy travelers as much as the real Imps. Transform them into something else, Wiz.”\n\n The Wizard took time to think. Then he transformed the white pigs into three blue doves.\n“Doves,” said he, “are the most harmless things in the world.”\n\nBut scarcely had he spoken when the doves flew at them and tried to peck out their eyes. When they endeavored to shield their eyes with their hands, two of the doves bit the Wizard’s fingers and another caught the pretty pink ear of the Princess in its bill and gave it such a cruel tweak that she cried out in pain and threw her skirt over her head.\n\n“These birds are worse than pigs, Wizard,” she called to her companion. “Nothing is harmless that is animated by impudent anger or impertinent mischief. You must transform the Imps into something that is not alive.”\n\nThe Wizard was pretty busy, just then, driving off the birds, but he managed to open his bag of magic and find a charm which instantly transformed the doves into three buttons. As they fell to the ground he picked them up and smiled with satisfaction. The tin button was Imp Olite, the brass button was Imp Udent and the lead button was Imp Ertinent. These buttons the Wizard placed in a little box which he put in his jacket pocket.\n\n “Now,” said he, “the Imps cannot annoy travelers, for we shall carry them back with us to the Emerald City.”\n“But we dare not use the buttons,” said Ozma, smiling once morenow that the danger was over.\n\n“Why not?” asked the Wizard. “I intend to sew them upon my coat and watch them carefully. The spirits of the Imps are still in the buttons, and after a time they will repent and be sorry for their naughtiness. Then they will decide to be very good in the future. When they feel that way, the tin button will turn to silver and the brass to gold, while the lead button will become aluminum. I shall then restore them to their proper forms, changing their names to pretty names instead of the ugly ones they used to bear. Thereafter the three Imps will become good citizens of the Land of Oz and I think you will find they will prove faithful subjects of our beloved Princess Ozma.”\n\n“Ah, that is magic well worthwhile,” exclaimed Ozma, well pleased. “There is no doubt, my friend, but that you are a very clever Wizard.”"

      "body": "Five Peas Fairy Tail:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived five peas in a pea pod. They were all different, but still living together, as the pea pod was still closed. They were too small to bear with the Sun. So, they used to sleep all day.\nBut at night, they used to talk to each other and listen to the music around them, especially the music of the Moon. The Moon when crescent, used to tie some silver strings to its ends. It used to play the harp and sing some beautiful songs for the peas.\n\nAt the times of full Moon, it used to play drums. The peas would wake up listening to the loud drums played by the moon. But every pea has its own reaction to the Moon’s music. “I love this sound of drums. Boom, boom, boom!” said the first pea. “I love its castanets. It’s soothing!” said the second pea. “I like the way it plays the harp. It’s very beautiful,” said the third pea.\n“Oh, why can’t there be some quiet time? Forget the music. I love to sleep as much as I can!” said the fourth pea. The fourth pea was very lazy. It loved to sleep all the time. The fifth and the youngest pea was very different from the other four. “I love all kinds of music. The castanets, the drums, and the harp are special and makes me happy when I listen to them,” said the fifth pea.\n\nThe peas were growing day by day. They didn’t realize it until they were fully grown. Now, they felt that their pod had become congested. “Please move aside! I’ve no space to move,” said the first pea. “Even I don’t have any! It’s stuffy here!” said the second pea. “The pod had become too cramped to stay,” cried the third pea. “I’m unable to sleep here! Please, make some space for me!” said the fourth pea. “I’m the smallest but still finding it difficult to move,” said the fifth pea. All of them were complaining and asking each other to move aside.\n\nSuddenly, the pea pod cracked open and a harsh light came in. All of them became very uncomfortable and wanted to stay inside the pea pod. Nobody wanted to come outside except the youngest one. He was very happy and excited to see the outside world. Later, when they all got comfortable with the Sunlight, they started a discussion. They discussed for a while and finally decided to go out of the pea pod. They took this as an adventure and decided to go for it.\n\nOne by one, the slid down from the pod. They landed on a furrow in a pea patch. They were very happy as they were exploring the world for the first time. “Wow! It’s so beautiful here,” said the first pea. “I’m happy to be there,” said the second pea. “It was a wise decision to leave the pod,” said the third pea. “I want to sleep. Find a good place for me,” said the fourth pea. “Hey, look! We were living too high on a branch too high from the ground,” said the fifth pea.\n\nAs they were discussing the new world they were seeing, a boy passing by saw them. “These peas seem to be perfect for my slingshot,” said the boy. The boy picked them up all of them one by one. The first pea flew far away in the sky, while the other peas couldn’t even see. Then the boy flew away the second, third, and fourth with his slingshot. Then flew the youngest pea! All of them were scared while the youngest pea was very happy and he was feeling like a butterfly flying through the clouds.\n\nThe youngest pea landed on a windowsill. “Thankfully, I’ve landed safely!” he said. As he gazed through the window, he saw a little girl lying on the bed. She was unwell and coughing continuously. Her mother was asking her to eat. The pea saw that the mother was trying to feed the little girl but the girl was too ill to eat. The mother seemed very worried about the girl.\n\nAt night, when the girl fell asleep, her mother prayed for her. “Please help my child to recover from this illness. I can’t see her suffering anymore. Bless her with good health, please! I beg you for my daughter’s life.” The pea too felt sad for the mother and her daughter.\n\nLater, that night, the pea entered the room through the window. With the full Moon in the sky, the pea sang a song with the drums for the girl. “Bang, Bang, Bang! Listen what I sang! Bang, Bang, Bang! Listen what I sang!” sang the pea. “Who is it? I heard some sound right now!” said the girl. “It’s me! I’m here in the window!” said the pea. The girl was shocked to see a speaking pea.\n\n“I can sing too. I was singing a song for you with the Moon’s drums. The Moon plays the drum when he’s full,” the pea said. “But I can’t hear it. You must be a special pea!” she said. “Everybody in this world is special and everything has some music within. We just have to concentrate and listen to it,” replied the pea. “You mean to say I can listen to the Moon’s drums. It this possible?” asked the girl. “Everything is possible in this world,” told the pea.\n\nAfter some time, the girl could finally listen to the Moon’s drums. She was very happy but her happiness didn’t last for long.\n\nShe was sad about her condition. The girl used to think that it was incurable. On hearing this, the pea said, “What if I become something other than a pea? Then you can also be better again!” “But you are only a pea! What else can you become?” asked the girl. “Of course, I can! Believe in yourself and you can achieve anything! If I become something else, would you believe that you’ll get cured?” asked the pea. “Okay, I will,” she smiled and went back to her bed.\n\nThe next morning when the girl woke up, she remembered the conversation with the pea. She looked for the pea in the window but he wasn’t there. “Oh! Maybe it was just a dream! How can a pea speak!” She went to the window and looked the fresh, sunny morning out there. “As the pea said can’t I believe I’ll be cured? I think I’ll get better,” she said.\n\nThe youngest pea was trying hard to keep his word. He stayed outside the window and got himself wrapped in the dust for a few days. Later, when the winter arrived, the dust helped him to survive through the snow. Every day, he was pushing himself towards his goal. “If I bear through these circumstances for few more days, I think I can achieve my goal. I’ll try harder to keep my promise.” The youngest pea survived through the winter with his strong willpower.\n\nThe season changed and the small pea got sprouted.He transformed into a plant with some branches and a couple of beautiful flowers.\n\nOne day, the girl’s mother noticed the beautiful sprouted pea plant outside the window. When the girl saw his friend transforming into a plant, she said to her mother, “If a pea can change his life, why not me? Now I believe I can be cured.” The girl smiled at the pea sprout. The mother took care of the pea sprout and took care of it."

      "body": "Salim Who Cried Wolf:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a shepherd boy named SALIM who lived in a village in one of the many beautiful valleys in Northern Pakistan. SALIM’s village was located at the foothills of Pakistan’s famous mountain range known as Kurra Kurram. These mountains are very high and very bare with no vegetation whatsoever. But it is a very different scene in the valleys. \n\nThere are fast-flowing rivers, like the Swat River, which runs from the snow-covered mountains to create beautiful waterfalls and lakes below. There is lush green grass; and in the springtime the ground is covered in brightly coloured flowers and hundreds upon hundreds of butterflies take to the air creating a truly heavenly place. There was another village further up the valley where SALIM’s cousin lived. \n\nLooking down from that village, the trees and houses below appeared like little toys. SALIM always enjoyed this scene whenever he visited his cousin, Hamza, and would often look for his own house in the village far below. The young boy marvelled at how small and distant it all seemed. SALIM’s father, Ahmed, owned a small herd of goats which he would take out of the village for grazing early each morning. SALIM often liked to accompany his father on these trips as there was no school in the small village. SALIM’s mother always made them a lunch of meat curry, chapattis and parathas, and a lovely milk drink called lussie. \n\nShe would wrap the lunch in a square of cloth and SALIM would carry it with him to keep it safe until it was time to eat. SALIM was a very active boy and would run around after the goats and keep them in check. His father was very pleased and thought that such training would make SALIM a very good shepherd when the boy was older. At midday, SALIM and his father would spread out a roll of cloth beneath the shade of a tree and sit down for their lunch. The young boy always enjoyed his paratha and his lussie drink. When eating, both father and son would keep a watchful eye on the goats to make sure that none wondered away from the herd. \n\nThey would always return home before sunset as there was no electricity in the village and they needed to eat their dinner before the night set in. SALIM went to bed soon after his dinner because there was little to do in the dark, and also because he had to wake very early each morning to milk the goats before taking them out to graze. SALIM enjoyed the lambing season when the goats and sheep gave birth to their kids and lambs. The young boy loved the little lambs and carried them around under his arm, imitating their tiny bleating sounds... ‘Maa..maa..maa..maa.’ Hamza would often visit from the hills above, then both boys would carry the lambs around and feed them soft food from their palms and cuddle up close to them to stay warm whenever the weather turned cold. When SALIM was older his father gave him the responsibility of looking after the herd.\n\n Hamza often joined SALIM and the two boys would get up early to milk the goats and then take the herd out of the village for grazing. This became a routine for both boys and the days and nights passed slowly. Until, one dark night, a wolf attacked the chickens and goats belonging to a farmer who lived close by. This caused much concern in the village and so it was decided that two men would be posted on guard to kill the wolf if it attacked again. \n\nThe wolf did attack again, but this time the men shot and killed the beast and the village soon returned to its peaceful state once more. Sometime later, when the two boys were sitting on a rock in the meadow watching the goats munching away at the fresh grass, Hamza said to SALIM, ‘The goats are grazing happily but we are always so bored. It is not fair.’ SALIM thought about this for a moment then replied, ‘We should do something exciting then. \n\nWhat shall we do?’ Naughty Hamza grinned from ear to ear. ‘We should make fools of the people of the village,’ he said at last. ‘How do we do that?’ asked SALIM. Hamza went on to remind SALIM about the night the wolf attacked the chickens and goats and how the men had been posted to guard the village with guns. ‘Then the wolf did attack and the men killed it! That was very exciting!’ exclaimed Hamza. ‘But then everything became peaceful and boring again.’ SALIM remembered because it was the only exciting thing that had happened in the village for a very long time. \n\n‘You know what I am thinking,’ continued Hamza. ‘If we shout and scream and say, “The wolf is attacking again! Help! Help!” then we would see how the people in the village would run to save us.’The Boy Who Cried Wolf ‘But it is very bad to tell lies,’ said SALIM, who was not at all sure about his cousin’s naughty plan. ‘It is just a joke,’ insisted Hamza. ‘Don’t you want to see their worried faces as they run to help us? It will be so funny.’ ‘And when they discover that there is no wolf and they see us laughing at them, they will be very annoyed with us,’ said SALIM. But even as he said this, SALIM had to admit that it would indeed be very funny to see the looks on the villagers’ faces as they ran into the meadow. He also had to admit that it was very boring watching the goats chew on the grass all day.\n\n ‘Okay,’ he said at last, ‘how do we do it?’ Hamza explained his plan and the two boys found themselves laughing and rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of making fun of the unsuspecting villagers. The next morning, after milking the goats, the two boys led the herd into the meadow to graze. \n\nAfter enjoying their tasty lunch, packed nicely for them by SALIM’s mother, they decided to carry out their naughty plan. Hamza hid himself behind a bush while SALIM ran down to the village shouting at the top of his voice, ‘Help us! Help us! The wolf is attacking Hamza! Please help us!’ As soon as the villagers heard SALIM’s cries for help, they picked up their sticks and axes and ran towards the meadow. ‘Where is the wolf?’ asked one man. ‘How did he attack Hamza?’ asked another. ‘Did the wolf drag him away like he did with my goats and chickens? Tell us, where is Hamza?’ The villagers were very worried as they searched all about for the injured boy. \n\nIt was then that Hamza jumped out from his hiding place. ‘Welcome. Thank you for coming,’ said the cheeky boy with a big grin upon his face, ‘but there is no wolf here. He ran away when I told him that the villagers were coming to kill him.’ Then Hamza fell to his knees and burst out laughing. When SALIM saw the looks of concern and panic on the villagers’ faces he too burst out laughing and began rolling about in the grass. \n\nThe villagers were very angry with the boys, and as they walked away from the meadow they promised to tell SALIM’s father about his son’s wicked behaviour. When Ahmed discovered what his son had done he was very disappointed indeed. He dragged the two boys before the crowd of villagers and made them both apologise for their sneaky trick and promise never to do such a thing again. A few months passed and life returned to normal. \n\nBut one day, as Hamza and SALIM were tending to the goats in the meadow, a fierce wolf came around the hill and tried to drag one of the goats away. Hamza jumped to his feet and ran after the wolf to scare it away. But the fierce wolf simply dropped the goat and got a hold of Hamza’s leg instead. SALIM was terrified at the sight of his friend being dragged away by the wolf and quickly ran towards the village screaming, ‘People of the village, please come quickly! The wolf is dragging Hamza away! Please help us!’ One of the villagers said, ‘We are not going to be fooled again! Go back to your goats.’ ‘Please!’ cried SALIM. ‘I am telling the truth. \n\nCome and help Hamza before it is too late!’ A kindly villager decided to take a look at the edge of the meadow and there he saw Hamza with his leg trapped in the wolf’s powerful jaws. ‘SALIM is telling the truth!’ he cried. ‘Come help at once!’ The villagers grabbed their sticks and axes and ran to help poor Hamza. And when the wolf saw the crowd running towards him, he let go of the boy’s leg and disappeared into the forest. \n\nTwo men picked Hamza up by his shoulders and they all returned to the village. The boy’s leg was very badly injured and he was in a great deal of pain. SALIM was close to tears and asked the villagers, ‘Why did you not come sooner? Why did you not believe me?’ A woman stepped forward. ‘You lied to us once before,’ she explained. ‘This is why we did not believe you. Do you see now why it is wrong to tell lies? You must never behave in such a way for it causes mistrust.’ SALIM looked at his injured cousin, and at the villagers who had saved the boy from the wolf, and he knew then that he would never tell a single lie ever again."

      "body": "The Six Swans:\n\nA King was once hunting in a large wood, and pursued his game so hotly that none of his companions could follow him. But when evening approached he stopped, and looking around him saw that he had lost himself. He sought a path out of the forest but could not find one, and presently he saw an old woman, with a nodding head, who came up to him. “My good woman,” he said to her, “can you show me the way out of the forest?” “Oh, yes, my lord King,” she replied; “I can do that very well, but upon one condition, which if you do not fulfil, you will never again get out of the wood, but will die of hunger.”\n\n“What, then, is this condition?” asked the King.\n\n“I have a daughter,” said the old woman, “who is as beautiful as any one you can find in the whole world, and well deserves to be your bride. Now, if you will make her your Queen, I will show you your way out of the wood.” In the anxiety of his heart, the King consented, and the old woman led him to her cottage, where the daughter was sitting by the fire. She received the King as if she had expected him, and he saw at once that she was very beautiful, but yet there was something just not quite right, for he could not look at her without shaking. However, he took the maiden upon his horse, and the old woman showed him the way, and the King arrived safely at his palace, where the wedding was to be celebrated.\n\nThe King had been married once before but his wife had tragically died of an illness. He had seven children by his first wife, six boys and a girl, whom he loved above everything else in the world. He became afraid, soon, that the step-mother might not treat his children very well, and might even do them some great injury, so he took them away to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest. The castle was so entirely hidden, and the way to it was so difficult to discover, that he himself could not have found it if a wise woman had not given him a ball of cotton which had the wonderful property, when he threw it before him, of unrolling itself and showing him the right path.\n\nThe King went, however, so often to see his dear children, that the Queen, noticing his absence, became curious, and wished to know what he went to fetch out of the forest. So she gave his servants a great quantity of money, and they told her the secret, and also told her of the ball of cotton which alone could show her the way. She had now no peace until she discovered where this ball was concealed, and then she made some fine silken shirts, and, as she had learnt of her mother, she sewed within each a charm.\n\nOne day soon after, when the King was gone out hunting, she took the little shirts and went into the forest, and the cotton showed her the path. The children, seeing some one coming in the distance, thought it was their dear father, and ran out full of joy. Then she threw over each of them a shirt, that, as it touched their bodies, changed them into Swans, which flew away over the forest. The Queen then went home quite contented, and thought she was free of her step-children; but the little girl had not met her with the brothers, and the Queen did not know of her.\n\nThe following day the King went to visit his children, but he found only the Maiden. “Where are your brothers?” asked he. “Ah, dear father,” she replied, “they are gone away and have left me alone”; and she told him how she had looked out of the window and seen them changed into Swans, which had flown over the forest; and then she showed him the feathers which they had dropped in the courtyard, and which she had collected together. The King was much saddened, but he did not think that his wife could have done this wicked deed, and, as he feared the girl might also be stolen away, he took her with him. She was, however, so much afraid of the step-mother, that she begged him not to stay more than one night in the castle.\n\nThe poor Maiden thought to herself, “This is no longer my place; I will go and seek my brothers”; and when night came she escaped and went quite deep into the wood. She walked all night long, and a great part of the next day, until she could go no further from weariness. Just then she saw a rough-looking hut, and going in, she found a room with six little beds, but she dared not get into one, so crept under, and laying herself upon the hard earth, prepared to pass the night there.\n\nJust as the sun was setting, she heard a rustling, and saw six white Swans come flying in at the window. They settled on the ground and began blowing one another until they had blown all their feathers off, and their swan’s down slipped from them like a shirt. Then the Maiden knew them at once for her brothers, and gladly crept out from under the bed, and the brothers were not less glad to see their sister, but their joy was of short duration. “Here you must not stay,” said they to her; “this is a robbers’ hiding-place; if they return and find you here, they will treat you very badly.”\n\n“Can you not protect me, then?” inquired the sister.\n\n“No,” they replied; “for we can only take off our swan’s feathers for a quarter of an hour each evening, and for that time we regain our human form, but afterwards we resume our changed appearance.”\n\nTheir sister then asked them, with tears, “Can you not be restored again?”\n\n“Oh, no,” replied they; “the conditions are too difficult. For six long years you must neither speak nor laugh, and during that time you must sew together for us six little shirts of star-flowers, and should there fall a single word from your lips, then all your labor will be in vain.” Just as the brothers finished speaking, the quarter of an hour elapsed, and they all flew out of the window again like Swans.\n\nThe little sister, however, made a solemn resolution to rescue her brothers, or die in the attempt; and she left the cottage, and, going deep into the forest, passed the night amid the branches of a tree. The next morning she went out and collected the star-flowers to sew together. She had no one to talk with and for laughing she had no spirits, so there up in the tree she sat, intent upon her work.\n\nAfter she had passed some time there, it happened that the King of that country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen came beneath the tree on which the Maiden sat. They called to her and asked, “Who are you?” But she gave no answer. “Come down to us,” continued they; “we will do you no harm.”\n\nShe simply shook her head, and when they pressed her further with questions, she threw down to them her gold necklace, hoping therewith to satisfy them. They did not, however, leave her, and she threw down her girdle, but in vain! and even her rich dress did not make them stop. At last the huntsman himself climbed the tree and brought down the Maiden, and took her before the King.\n\nThe King asked her, “Who are you? What are you doing upon that tree?” But she did not answer; and then he questioned her in all the languages that he knew, but she remained dumb to all, as a fish. Since, however, she was so beautiful, the King’s heart was touched, and he started to have feelings for her. Then he put around her his cloak, and, placing her before him on his horse, took her to his castle. There he ordered rich clothing to be made for her, and, although her beauty shone as the sunbeams, not a word escaped her. The King placed her by his side at table, and there her dignified manners so impressed him, that he said, “This Maiden will I marry, and no other in the world;” and after some days he wedded her.\n\nNow, the King had a wicked step-mother, who was not happy with his marriage, and spoke evil of the young Queen. “Who knows where the girl comes from?” she said. “She who cannot speak is not worthy of a King.” A year after, when the Queen brought her first-born into the world, the old woman took him away. Then she went to the King and complained that the Queen was a murderess. The King, however, would not believe it, and ordered no-one to harm his wife, who sat composedly sewing at her shirts and paying attention to nothing else. When a second child was born, the false stepmother used the same trick, but the King again would not listen to her words, saying, “She is too good and kind to act so; could she but speak and defend herself, her innocence would come to light.” But when again, the old woman stole away the third child, and then accused the Queen, who answered not a word to the accusation, the King felt he had to give her up to tried, where she was found guilty and sentenced pay with her life.\n\nWhen the time had elapsed, and the sentence was to be carried out, it happened that the very day had come round when her dear brothers should be set free; the six shirts were also ready, all but the last, which yet needed the left sleeve. As she was led to the scaffold, she placed the shirts upon her arm, and just as she had mounted it, and the fire was about to be kindled, she looked around, and saw six Swans come flying through the air. Her heart leaped for joy as she saw her deliverers approaching, and soon the Swans, flying towards her, landed so near that she was able to throw over them the shirts, and as soon as she had done so, their feathers fell off and the brothers stood up alive and well; but the youngest was without his left arm, instead of which he had a swan’s wing.\n\nThey embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen, going to the King, who was thunderstruck, began to say, “Now may I speak, my dear husband, and prove to you that I am innocent and falsely accused;” and then she told him how the wicked woman had stolen away and hidden her three children. When she had concluded, the King was overcome with joy, and the wicked stepmother was taken away, where she confessed to where she was keeping the children. The King and Queen were reunited with their children and for ever after lived in peace and prosperity."

      "body": "The Three Little Pigs:\n\nOnce upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune.\n\nThe first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, “Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house”; which the Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it. Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”\n\nTo which the Pig answered, “No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”\n\n“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” said the Wolf. So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and the little Pig ran for his life.\n\nThe second Pig met a Man with a bundle of sticks, and said, “Please, Man, give me those sticks to build a house”; which the Man did, and the Pig built his house. Then along came the Wolf and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”\n\n“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”\n\n“Then I’ll puff and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in!” So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and the second little Pig ran for his life.\n\nThe third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, “Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with”; so the Man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them. So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”\n\n“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.” “Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.” Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house down. When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, “Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”\n\n“Where?” said the little Pig.\n\n“Oh, in Mr. Smith’s home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner.”\n\n“Very well,” said the little Pig, “I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?”\n\n“Oh, at six o’clock.”\n\n Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six. When the Wolf came he said, “Little Pig, are you ready?”\n\n“Ready!” said the little Pig, “I have been and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner.”\n\nThe Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, “Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree.” “Where?” said the Pig.\n\n“Down at Merry-garden,” replied the Wolf; “and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o’clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples.”\n\n Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and got himself up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much. When the Wolf came up he said, “Little Pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice apples?”\n\n“Yes, very,” said the little Pig; “I will throw you down one.” And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home.\n\nThe next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, “Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” said the Pig, I will go; what time shall you be ready?”\n\n“At three,” said the Wolf.\n\nSo the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.\n\nHe went to the little Pig’s house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.\n\nThen the little Pig said, “Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.”\n\n Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.\n\n When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after."

      "body": "The Thanksgiving Of The Wazir:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived in Hindustan two kings whose countries bordered upon each other; but, as they were rivals in wealth and power, and one was a Hindu rajah and the other a Mohammedan badshah, they were not good friends at all.\n\nIn order, however, to escape continual quarrels, the rajah and the badshah had drawn up an agreement, stamped and signed, declaring that if any of their subjects, from the least to the greatest, crossed the boundary between the two kingdoms, he might be seized and punished.\n\nOne morning the badshah and his chief wazir, or prime minister, were just about to begin their morning's work over the affairs of the kingdom, and the badshah had taken up a pen and was cutting it to his liking with a sharp knife, when the knife slipped and cut off the tip of his finger.\n\n\"Oh-he, wazir!\" cried the king, \"I've cut the tip of my finger off!\"\n\n\"That is good hearing!\" said the wazir in answer.\n\n\"Insolent one,\" exclaimed the king. \"Do you take pleasure in the misfortunes of others, and in mine also? Take him away, my guards, and put him in the court prison until I have time to punish him as he deserves!\"\n\nInstantly the officers in attendance seized upon the luckless wazir, and dragged him out of the king's presence towards the narrow doorway, through which unhappy criminals were wont to be led to prison or execution.\n\nAs the door opened to receive him, the wazir muttered something into his great white beard which the soldiers could not hear.\n\n\"What said the rascal?\" shouted the angry king.\n\nHe says, \"he thanks your majesty,\" replied one of the gaolers. And at his words, the king stared at the closing door, in anger and amazement.\n\n\"He must be mad,\" he cried, \"for he is grateful, not only for the misfortunes of others, but for his own; surely something has turned his head!\"\n\nNow the king was very fond of his old wazir, and although the court physician came and bound up his injured finger with cool and healing ointment, and soothed the pain, he could not soothe the soreness of the king's heart, nor could any of all his ministers and courtiers, who found his majesty very cross all the day long.\n\nEarly next morning the king ordered his horse and declared that he would go hunting.\n\nInstantly all was bustle and preparation in stable and hall, and by the time he was ready a score of ministers and huntsmen stood ready to mount and accompany him ; but to their astonishment the king would have none of them. In- deed, he glared at them so fiercely that they were glad to leave him. So away and away he wandered, over field and through forest, so moody and thoughtful that many a fat buck and gaudy pheasant escaped without notice, and so careless was he whither he was going that he strayed without perceiving it over into the rajah's territory, and only discovered the fact when, suddenly, men stepped from all sides out of a thicket, and there was nothing left but surrender. Then the poor badshah was seized and bound and taken to the rajah's prison, thinking most of the time of his wazir, who was suffering a similar fate, and wishing that, like the wazir, he could feel that there was something to give thanks for.\n\nThat night the rajah held a special council to consider what should be done to his rival who had thus given himself into his hands. All the Brahmans were sent for fat priests who understood all about everything, and what days were lucky and what unlucky and, whilst all the rest of the rajah's councillors were offering him different advice until he was nearly crazy with anger and indecision, the chief Brahman was squatting in a corner figuring out sums and signs to himself with an admiring group of lesser priests around him. At last he arose, and advanced towards the throne.\n\n\"Well\" said the rajah anxiously, \"what have you to advise?\"\n\n\"A very unlucky day!\" exclaimed the chief Brahman. \"Oh, a very unlucky day! The god Devi is full of wrath, and commands that to-morrow you must chop off this badshah's head and offer it in to him in sacrifice.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" said the rajah, \"let it be done. I leave it to you to carry out the sentence.\" And he bowed to the priests and left the room.\n\nBefore dawn great preparations were being made for a grand festival in honour of the great idol Devi. Hun- dreds of banners waved, hundreds of drummers drummed, hundreds of singers chanted chants, hundreds of priests, well washed and anointed, performed their sacred rites, whilst the rajah sat, nervous and ill at ease, amongst hundreds of courtiers and servants, wishing it were all well over. At last the time came for the sacrifice to be offered, and the poor bldshah was led out bound, to have his head chopped off.\n\nThe chief Brahman came along with a smile on his face, and a big sword in his hand, when, suddenly, he noticed that the badshah's finger was tied up in a bit of rag. Instantly he dropped the sword, and, with his eyes starting out of his head with excitement, pounced upon the rag and tore it off, and there he saw that the tip of his victim's finger was missing. At this he got very red and angry indeed, and he led the badshah up to where the rajah sat wondering.\n\n\"Behold! O rajah,\" he said, \"this sacrifice is useless, the tip of his finger is gone! A sacrifice is no sacrifice unless it is complete.\" And he began to weep with rage and mortification.\n\nBut instead of wailing likewise, the rajah gave a sigh of relief, and answered: \"Well, that settles the matter. If it had been anyone else I should not have minded; but, somehow a king and all well, it doesn't seem quite right to sacrifice a king.\" And with that he jumped up and with his jewelled dagger cut the badshah's cords, and marched with him out of the temple back to the palace.\n\nAfter having bathed and refreshed his guest, the rajah loaded him with gifts, and himself accompanied him with a large escort as far as the frontier between their kingdoms, where, amidst salutes and great rejoicings, they tore up the old agreement and drew up another in which each king promised welcome and safe conduct to any of the other's people, from the least to the greatest, who came over the border on any errand whatever. And so they embraced, and each went his own way.\n\nWhen the badshah got home that very evening he sent for his imprisoned wazir.\n\n\"Well, O wazir!\" he said, when the old man had been brought before him, \"what think you has been happening to me?\"\n\n\"How can a man in prison know what is happening outside it?\" answered the wazir.\n\nThen the badshah told him all his adventures. And when he had reached the end he added:\n\n\"I have made up my mind, as a token of gratitude for my escape, to pardon you freely, if you will tell me why you gave thanks when I cut off the tip of my finger.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the old wazir, \"am I not right in thinking that it was a very lucky thing for you that you did cut off the tip of your finger, for otherwise you would certainly have lost your head. And to lose a scrap of one's finger is surely the least of the two evils.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" answered the king, touching his head as he spoke, as if to make quite certain that it was still there, \"but yet why did you likewise give thanks when I put you into prison?\"\n\n\"I gave thanks,\" said the wazir, \"because it is good always to give thanks. And had I known that my being in prison was to prevent the god Devi claiming me instead of your majesty, as a perfect offering, I should have given greater thanks still.\""

Every day the fisherman went out fishing, and he fished, and he fished. Once he was sitting there fishing and looking into the clear water, and he sat, and he sat. Then his hook went to the bottom, deep down, and when he pulled it out, he had caught a large flounder.\nThen the flounder said to him, \"Listen, fisherman, I beg you to let me live.

See, now isn't this much better?\"\n\nThere was a little front yard, and a beautiful little parlor, and a bedroom where their bed was standing, and a kitchen, and a dining room. Everything was beautifully furnished and supplied with tin and brass utensils, just as it should be. And outside there was a little yard with chickens and ducks and a garden with vegetables and fruit.\n\n\"Look,\" said the woman. \"Isn't this nice?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man. \"This is quite enough. We can live here very well.\"\n\n\"We will think about that,\" said the woman.\n\nThen they ate something and went to bed.\n\nEverything went well for a week or two, and then the woman said, \"Listen, husband. This cottage is too small. The yard and the garden are too little. The flounder could have given us a larger house. I would like to live in a large stone palace. Go back to the flounder and tell him to give us a palace.\"\n\n\"Oh, wife,\" said the man, \"the cottage is good enough. Why would we want to live in a palace?\"\n\n\"I know why,\" said the woman. \"Now you just go. The flounder can do that.\"\n\n\"Now, wife, the flounder has just given us the cottage. I don't want to go back so soon. It may make the flounder angry.\"\n\n\"Just go,\" said the woman. \"He can do it, and he won't mind doing it. Just go.\"\n\nThe man's heart was heavy, and he did not want to go. He said to himself, \"This is not right,\" but he went anyway.\n\nWhen he arrived at the sea the water was purple and dark blue and gray and dense, and no longer green and yellow. He stood there and said:\n\nMandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!\nFlounder, flounder, in the sea!\nMy wife, my wife Ilsebill,\nWants not, wants not, what I will\n\"What does she want then?\" said the flounder.\n\"Oh,\" said the man sadly, \"my wife wants to live in a stone palace.\"\n\n\"Go home. She's already standing before the door,\" said the flounder.\n\nThen the man went his way, thinking he was going home, but when he arrived, standing there was a large stone palace. His wife was standing on the stairway, about to enter.\n\nTaking him by the hand, she said, \"Come inside.\"\n\nHe went inside with her. Inside the palace there was a large front hallway with a marble floor. Numerous servants opened up the large doors for them. The walls were all white and covered with beautiful tapestry. In the rooms there were chairs and tables of pure gold. Crystal chandeliers hung from the ceilings. The rooms and chambers all had carpets. Food and the very best wine overloaded the tables until they almost collapsed. Outside the house there was a large courtyard with the very best carriages and stalls for horses and cows. Furthermore there was a magnificent garden with the most beautiful flowers and fine fruit trees and a pleasure forest a good half mile long, with elk and deer and hares and everything that anyone could possibly want.\n\n\"Now,\" said the woman, \"isn't this nice?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes\" said the man. \"This is quite enough. We can live in this beautiful palace and be satisfied.\"\n\n\"We'll think about it,\" said the woman. \"Let's sleep on it.\" And with that they went to bed.\n\nThe next morning the woman woke up first. It was just daylight, and from her bed she could see the magnificent landscape before her. Her husband was just starting to stir when she poked him in the side with her elbow and said, \"Husband, get up and look out the window. Look, couldn't we be king over all this land?\"\n\n\"Oh, wife,\" said the man, \"why would we want to be king? I don't want to be king.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the woman, \"even if you don't want to be king, I want to be king.\"\n\n\"Oh, wife,\" said the man, \"why do you want to be king? I don't want to tell him that.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said the woman, \"Go there immediately. I must be king.\"\n\nSo the man, saddened because his wife wanted to be king, went back.\n\n\"This is not right, not right at all,\" thought the man. He did not want to go, but he went anyway.\n\nWhen he arrived at the sea it was dark gray, and the water heaved up from below and had a foul smell. He stood there and said:\n\nMandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!\nFlounder, flounder, in the sea!\nMy wife, my wife Ilsebill,\nWants not, wants not, what I will\n\"What does she want then,\" said the flounder.\n\"Oh,\" said the man, \"she wants to be king.\"\n\n\"Go home. She is already king,\" said the flounder.\n\nThen the man went home, and when he arrived there, the palace had become much larger, with a tall tower and magnificent decorations. Sentries stood outside the door, and there were so many soldiers, and drums, and trumpets. When he went inside everything was of pure marble and gold with velvet covers and large golden tassels. Then the doors to the great hall opened up, and there was the entire court. His wife was sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds. She was wearing a large golden crown, and in her hand was a scepter of pure gold and precious stones. On either side of her there stood a line of maids-in-waiting, each one a head shorter than the other.\n\n\"Oh, wife, are you now king?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"now I am king.\"\n\nHe stood and looked at her, and after thus looking at her for a while he said, \"Wife, it is very nice that you are king. Now we don't have to wish for anything else.\"\n\n\"No, husband,\" she said, becoming restless. \"Time is on my hands. I cannot stand it any longer. Go to the flounder. I am king, but now I must become emperor.\"\n\n\"Oh, wife\" said the man, \"Why do you want to become emperor?\"\n\n\"Husband,\" she said, \"go to the flounder. I want to be emperor.\"\n\n\"Oh, wife,\" said the man, \"he cannot make you emperor. I cannot tell the flounder to do that. There is only one emperor in the realm. The flounder cannot make you emperor. He cannot do that.\"\n\n\"What!\" said the woman. \"I am king, and you are my husband. Are you going? Go there immediately. If he can make me king then he can make me emperor. I want to be and have to be emperor. Go there immediately.\"\n\nSo he had to go. As he went on his way the frightened man thought to himself, \"This is not going to end well. To ask to be emperor is shameful. The flounder is going to get tired of this.\"\n\nWith that he arrived at the sea. The water was all black and dense and boiling up from within. A strong wind blew over him that curdled the water. He stood there and said:\n\nMandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!\nFlounder, flounder, in the sea!\nMy wife, my wife Ilsebill,\nWants not, wants not, what I will\n\"What does she want then?\" said the flounder.\n\"Oh, flounder,\" he said, \"my wife wants to become emperor.\"\n\n\"Go home,\" said the flounder. \"She is already emperor.\"\n\nThen the man went home, and when he arrived there, the entire palace was made of polished marble with alabaster statues and golden decoration. Soldiers were marching outside the gate, blowing trumpets and beating tympani and drums. Inside the house, barons and counts and dukes were walking around like servants. They opened the doors for him, which were made of pure gold. He went inside where his wife was sitting on a throne made of one piece of gold a good two miles high, and she was wearing a large golden crown that was three yards high, all set with diamonds and carbuncles. In the one hand she had a scepter, and in the other the imperial orb. Bodyguards were standing in two rows at her sides: each one smaller than the other, beginning with the largest giant and ending with the littlest dwarf, who was no larger than my little finger. Many princes and dukes were standing in front of her.\n\nThe man went and stood among them and said, \"Wife, are you emperor now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I am emperor.\"\n\nHe stood and looked at her, and after thus looking at her for a while, he said, \"Wife, it is very nice that you are emperor.\"\n\n\"Husband,\" she said. \"Why are you standing there? Now that I am emperor, and I want to become pope.\"\n\n\"Oh, wife!\" said the man. \"What do you not want? There is only one pope in all Christendom. He cannot make you pope.\"\n\n\"Husband,\" she said, \"I want to become pope. Go there immediately. I must become pope this very day.\"\n\n\"No, wife,\" he said, \"I cannot tell him that. It will come to no good. That is too much. The flounder cannot make you pope.\"\n\n\"Husband, what nonsense!\" said the woman. \"If he can make me emperor, then he can make me pope as well. Go there immediately. I am emperor, and you are my husband. Are you going?\"\n\nThen the frightened man went. He felt sick all over, and his knees and legs were shaking, and the wind was blowing over the land, and clouds flew by as the darkness of evening fell. Leaves blew from the trees, and the water roared and boiled as it crashed onto the shore. In the distance he could see ships, shooting distress signals as they tossed and turned on the waves. There was a little blue in the middle of the sky, but on all sides it had turned red, as in a terrible lightning storm. Full of despair he stood there and said:\n\nMandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!\nFlounder, flounder, in the sea!\nMy wife, my wife Ilsebill,\nWants not, wants not, what I will\n\"What does she want then?\" said the flounder.\n\"Oh,\" said the man, \"she wants to become pope.\"\n\n\"Go home,\" said the flounder. \"She is already pope.\"\n\nThen he went home, and when he arrived there, there was a large church surrounded by nothing but palaces. He forced his way through the crowd. Inside everything was illuminated with thousands and thousands of lights, and his wife was clothed in pure gold and sitting on a much higher throne. She was wearing three large golden crowns. She was surrounded with church-like splendor, and at her sides there were two banks of candles. The largest was as thick and as tall as the largest tower, down to the smallest kitchen candle. And all the emperors and kings were kneeling before her kissing her slipper.\n\n\"Wife,\" said the man, giving her a good look, \"are you pope now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I am pope.\"\n\nThen he stood there looking at her, and it was as if he were looking into the bright sun. After he had looked at her for a while he said, \"Wife, It is good that you are pope!\"\n\nShe stood there as stiff as a tree, neither stirring nor moving.\n\nThen he said, \"Wife, be satisfied now that you are pope. There is nothing else that you can become.\"\n\n\"I have to think about that,\" said the woman.\n\nThen they both went to bed, but she was not satisfied. Her desires would not let her sleep. She kept thinking what she wanted to become next.\n\nThe man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a lot during the day, but the woman could not sleep at all, but tossed and turned from one side to the other all night long, always thinking about what she could become, but she could not think of anything.\n\nThen the sun was about to rise, and when she saw the early light of dawn she sat up in bed and watched through the window as the sun came up.\n\n\"Aha,\" she thought. \"Could not I cause the sun and the moon to rise?\"\n\n\"Husband,\" she said, poking him in the ribs with her elbow, \"wake up and go back to the flounder. I want to become like God.\"\n\nThe man, who was still mostly asleep, was so startled that he fell out of bed. He thought that he had misunderstood her, so, rubbing his eyes, he said, \"Wife, what did you say?\"\n\n\"Husband,\" she said, \"I cannot stand it when I see the sun and the moon rising, and I cannot cause them to do so. I will not have a single hour of peace until I myself can cause them to rise.\"\n\nShe looked at him so gruesomely that he shuddered.\n\n\"Go there immediately. I want to become like God.\"\n\n\"Oh, wife,\" said the man, falling on his knees before her, \"the flounder cannot do that. He can make you emperor and pope, but I beg you, be satisfied and remain pope.\"\n\nAnger fell over her. Her hair flew wildly about her head. Tearing open her bodice she kicked him with her foot and shouted, \"I cannot stand it! I cannot stand it any longer! Go there immediately!\"\n\nHe put on his trousers and ran off like a madman.\n\nOutside such a storm was raging that he could hardly stand on his feet. Houses and trees were blowing over. The mountains were shaking, and boulders were rolling from the cliffs into the sea. The sky was as black as pitch. There was thunder and lightning. In the sea there were great black waves as high as church towers and mountains, all capped with crowns of white foam.\n\nMandje! Mandje! Timpe Te!\nFlounder, flounder, in the sea!\nMy wife, my wife Ilsebill,\nWants not, wants not, what I will\n\"What does she want then?\" said the flounder.\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"she wants to become like God.\"\n\n\"Go home. She is sitting in her filthy shack again.\"\n\nAnd they are sitting there even today."

The next moment, entered the Lord of Death in the conference hall. The Lord of Death cast a glance at the parrot and smiled.

But Destiny too expressed her inability to take a final decision with respect to the life and death of Lord Indra's parrot.

      "body": "The Son Of Seven Queens: Indian Fairy Tale:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a King who had seven Queens, but no children. This was a great grief to him, especially when he remembered that on his death there would be no heir to inherit the kingdom.\n\nNow it happened one day that a poor old fakir came to the King, and said, \"Your prayers are heard, your desire shall be accomplished, and one of your seven Queens shall bear a son.\"\n\nThe King's delight at this promise knew no bounds, and he gave orders for appropriate festivities to be prepared against the coming event throughout the length and breadth of the land.\n\nMeanwhile the seven Queens lived luxuriously in a splendid palace, attended by hundreds of female slaves, and fed to their hearts' content on sweetmeats and confectionery.\n\nNow the King was very fond of hunting, and one day, before he started, the seven Queens sent him a message saying, \"May it please our dearest lord not to hunt towards the north to-day, for we have dreamt bad dreams, and fear lest evil should befall you.\"\n\nThe King, to allay their anxiety, promised regard for their wishes, and set out towards the south; but as luck would have it, although he hunted diligently, he found no game. Nor had he more success to the east or west, so that, being a keen sportsman, and determined not to go home empty-handed, he forgot all about his promise, and turned to the north. Here also he was at first unsuccessful, but just as he had made up his mind to give up for that day, a white hind with golden horns and silver hoofs flashed past him into a thicket. So quickly did it pass that he scarcely saw it; nevertheless a burning desire to capture and possess the beautiful strange creature filled his breast. He instantly ordered his attendants to form a ring round the thicket, and so encircle the hind; then, gradually narrowing the circle, he pressed forward till he could distinctly see the white hind panting in the midst. Nearer and nearer he advanced, till, just as he thought to lay hold of the beautiful strange creature, it gave one mighty bound, leapt clean over the King's head, and fled towards the mountains. Forgetful of all else, the King, setting spurs to his horse, followed at full speed. On, on he galloped, leaving his retinue far behind, keeping the white hind in view, never drawing bridle, until, finding himself in a narrow ravine with no outlet, he reined in his steed. Before him stood a miserable hovel, into which, being tired after his long, unsuccessful chase, he entered to ask for a drink of water. An old woman, seated in the hut at a spinning-wheel, answered his request by calling to her daughter, and immediately from an inner room came a maiden so lovely and charming, so white-skinned and golden-haired, that the King was transfixed by astonishment at seeing so beautiful a sight in the wretched hovel.\n\nShe held the vessel of water to the King's lips, and as he drank he looked into her eyes, and then it became clear to him that the girl was no other than the white hind with the golden horns and silver feet he had chased so far.\n\nHer beauty bewitched him, so he fell on his knees, begging her to return with him as his bride; but she only laughed, saying seven Queens were quite enough even for a King to manage. However, when he would take no refusal, but implored her to have pity on him, promising her everything she could desire, she replied, \"Give me the eyes of your seven Queens, and then perhaps I may believe you mean what you say.\"\n\nThe King was so carried away by the glamour of the white hind's magical beauty, that he went home at once, had the eyes of his seven Queens taken out, and, after throwing the poor blind creatures into a noisome dungeon whence they could not escape, set off once more for the hovel in the ravine, bearing with him his horrible offering. But the white hind only laughed cruelly when she saw the fourteen eyes, and threading them as a necklace, flung it round her mother's neck, saying, \"Wear that, little mother, as a keepsake, whilst I am away in the King's palace.\"\n\nThen she went back with the bewitched monarch, as his bride, and he gave her the seven Queens' rich clothes and jewels to wear, the seven Queens' palace to live in, and the seven Queens' slaves to wait upon her; so that she really had everything even a witch could desire.\n\nNow, very soon after the seven wretched hapless Queens had their eyes torn out, and were cast into prison, a baby was born to the youngest of the Queens. It was a handsome boy, but the other Queens were very jealous that the youngest amongst them should be so fortunate. But though at first they disliked the handsome little boy, he soon proved so useful to them, that ere long they all looked on him as their son. Almost as soon as he could walk about he began scraping at the mud wall of their dungeon, and in an incredibly short space of time had made a hole big enough for him to crawl through. Through this he disappeared, returning in an hour or so laden with sweetmeats, which he divided equally amongst the seven blind Queens.\n\nAs he grew older he enlarged the hole, and slipped out two or three times every day to play with the little nobles in the town. No one knew who the tiny boy was, but everybody liked him, and he was so full of funny tricks and antics, so merry and bright, that he was sure to be rewarded by some girdle-cakes, a handful of parched grain, or some sweetmeats. All these things he brought home to his seven mothers, as he loved to call the seven blind Queens, who by his help lived on in their dungeon when all the world thought they had starved to death ages before.\n\nAt last, when he was quite a big lad, he one day took his bow and arrow, and went out to seek for game. Coming by chance past the palace where the white hind lived in wicked splendour and magnificence, he saw some pigeons fluttering round the white marble turrets, and, taking good aim, shot one dead. It came tumbling past the very window where the white Queen was sitting; she rose to see what was the matter, and looked out. At the first glance of the handsome young lad standing there bow in hand, she knew by witchcraft that it was the King's son.\n\nShe nearly died of envy and spite, determining to destroy the lad without delay; therefore, sending a servant to bring him to her presence, she asked him if he would sell her the pigeon he had just shot.\n\n\"No,\" replied the sturdy lad, \"the pigeon is for my seven blind mothers, who live in the noisome dungeon, and who would die if I did not bring them food.\"\n\n\"Poor souls!\" cried the cunning white witch; \"would you not like to bring them their eyes again? Give me the pigeon, my dear, and I faithfully promise to show you where to find them.\"\n\nHearing this, the lad was delighted beyond measure, and gave up the pigeon at once. Whereupon the white Queen told him to seek her mother without delay, and ask for the eyes which she wore as a necklace.\n\n\"She will not fail to give them,\" said the cruel Queen, \"if you show her this token on which I have written what I want done.\"\n\nSo saying, she gave the lad a piece of broken potsherd, with these words inscribed on it--\"Kill the bearer at once, and sprinkle his blood like water!\"\n\nNow, as the son of seven Queens could not read, he took the fatal message cheerfully, and set off to find the white Queen's mother.\n\nWhilst he was journeying he passed through a town, where every one of the inhabitants looked so sad, that he could not help asking what was the matter. They told him it was because the King's only daughter refused to marry; so when her father died there would be no heir to the throne. They greatly feared she must be out of her mind, for though every good-looking young man in the kingdom had been shown to her, she declared she would only marry one who was the son of seven mothers, and who ever heard of such a thing? The King, in despair, had ordered every man who entered the city gates to be led before the Princess; so, much to the lad's impatience, for he was in an immense hurry to find his mothers' eyes, he was dragged into the presence-chamber.\n\nNo sooner did the Princess catch sight of him than she blushed, and, turning to the King, said, \"Dear father, this is my choice!\"\n\nNever were such rejoicings as these few words produced.\n\n[Illustration: THE SON OF SEVEN MOTHERS]\n\nThe inhabitants nearly went wild with joy, but the son of seven Queens said he would not marry the Princess unless they first let him recover his mothers' eyes. When the beautiful bride heard his story, she asked to see the potsherd, for she was very learned and clever. Seeing the treacherous words, she said nothing, but taking another similar-shaped bit of potsherd, she wrote on it these words--\"Take care of this lad, giving him all he desires,\" and returned it to the son of seven Queens, who, none the wiser, set off on his quest.\n\nEre long he arrived at the hovel in the ravine where the white witch's mother, a hideous old creature, grumbled dreadfully on reading the message, especially when the lad asked for the necklace of eyes. Nevertheless she took it off, and gave it him, saying, \"There are only thirteen of 'em now, for I lost one last week.\"\n\nThe lad, however, was only too glad to get any at all, so he hurried home as fast as he could to his seven mothers, and gave two eyes apiece to the six elder Queens; but to the youngest he gave one, saying, \"Dearest little mother!--I will be your other eye always!\"\n\nAfter this he set off to marry the Princess, as he had promised, but when passing by the white Queen's palace he saw some pigeons on the roof. Drawing his bow, he shot one, and it came fluttering past the window. The white hind looked out, and lo! there was the King's son alive and well.\n\nShe cried with hatred and disgust, but sending for the lad, asked him how he had returned so soon, and when she heard how he had brought home the thirteen eyes, and given them to the seven blind Queens, she could hardly restrain her rage. Nevertheless she pretended to be charmed with his success, and told him that if he would give her this pigeon also, she would reward him with the Jogi's wonderful cow, whose milk flows all day long, and makes a pond as big as a kingdom. The lad, nothing loth, gave her the pigeon; whereupon, as before, she bade him go ask her mother for the cow, and gave him a potsherd whereon was written--\"Kill this lad without fail, and sprinkle his blood like water!\"\n\nBut on the way the son of seven Queens looked in on the Princess, just to tell her how he came to be delayed, and she, after reading the message on the potsherd, gave him another in its stead; so that when the lad reached the old hag's hut and asked her for the Jogi's cow, she could not refuse, but told the boy how to find it; and bidding him of all things not to be afraid of the eighteen thousand demons who kept watch and ward over the treasure, told him to be off before she became too angry at her daughter's foolishness in thus giving away so many good things.\n\nThen the lad did as he had been told bravely. He journeyed on and on till he came to a milk-white pond, guarded by the eighteen thousand demons. They were really frightful to behold, but, plucking up courage, he whistled a tune as he walked through them, looking neither to the right nor the left. By-and-by he came upon the Jogi's cow, tall, white, and beautiful, while the Jogi himself, who was king of all the demons, sat milking her day and night, and the milk streamed from her udder, filling the milk-white tank.\n\nThe Jogi, seeing the lad, called out fiercely, \"What do you want here?\"\n\nThen the lad answered, according to the old hag's bidding, \"I want your skin, for King Indra is making a new kettle-drum, and says your skin is nice and tough.\"\n\nUpon this the Jogi began to shiver and shake (for no Jinn or Jogi dares disobey King Indra's command), and, falling at the lad's feet, cried, \"If you will spare me I will give you anything I possess, even my beautiful white cow!\"\n\nTo this the son of seven Queens, after a little pretended hesitation, agreed, saying that after all it would not be difficult to find a nice tough skin like the Jogi's elsewhere; so, driving the wonderful cow before him, he set off homewards. The seven Queens were delighted to possess so marvellous an animal, and though they toiled from morning till night making curds and whey, besides selling milk to the confectioners, they could not use half the cow gave, and became richer and richer day by day.\n\nSeeing them so comfortably off, the son of seven Queens started with a light heart to marry the Princess; but when passing the white hind's palace he could not resist sending a bolt at some pigeons which were cooing on the parapet. One fell dead just beneath the window where the white Queen was sitting. Looking out, she saw the lad hale and hearty standing before her, and grew whiter than ever with rage and spite.\n\nShe sent for him to ask how he had returned so soon, and when she heard how kindly her mother had received him, she very nearly had a fit; however, she dissembled her feelings as well as she could, and, smiling sweetly, said she was glad to have been able to fulfil her promise, and that if he would give her this third pigeon, she would do yet more for him than she had done before, by giving him the million-fold rice, which ripens in one night.\n\nThe lad was of course delighted at the very idea, and, giving up the pigeon, set off on his quest, armed as before with a potsherd, on which was written, \"Do not fail this time. Kill the lad, and sprinkle his blood like water!\"\n\nBut when he looked in on his Princess, just to prevent her becoming anxious about him, she asked to see the potsherd as usual, and substituted another, on which was written, \"Yet again give this lad all he requires, for his blood shall be as your blood!\"\n\nNow when the old hag saw this, and heard how the lad wanted the million-fold rice which ripens in a single night, she fell into the most furious rage, but being terribly afraid of her daughter, she controlled herself, and bade the boy go and find the field guarded by eighteen millions of demons, warning him on no account to look back after having plucked the tallest spike of rice, which grew in the centre.\n\nSo the son of seven Queens set off, and soon came to the field where, guarded by eighteen millions of demons, the million-fold rice grew. He walked on bravely, looking neither to the right or left, till he reached the centre and plucked the tallest ear, but as he turned homewards a thousand sweet voices rose behind him, crying in tenderest accents, \"Pluck me too! oh, please pluck me too!\" He looked back, and lo! there was nothing left of him but a little heap of ashes!\n\nNow as time passed by and the lad did not return, the old hag grew uneasy, remembering the message \"his blood shall be as your blood\"; so she set off to see what had happened.\n\nSoon she came to the heap of ashes, and knowing by her arts what it was, she took a little water, and kneading the ashes into a paste, formed it into the likeness of a man; then, putting a drop of blood from her little finger into its mouth, she blew on it, and instantly the son of seven Queens started up as well as ever.\n\n\"Don't you disobey orders again!\" grumbled the old hag, \"or next time I'll leave you alone. Now be off, before I repent of my kindness!\"\n\nSo the son of seven Queens returned joyfully to his seven mothers, who, by the aid of the million-fold rice, soon became the richest people in the kingdom. Then they celebrated their son's marriage to the clever Princess with all imaginable pomp; but the bride was so clever, she would not rest until she had made known her husband to his father, and punished the wicked white witch. So she made her husband build a palace exactly like the one in which the seven Queens had lived, and in which the white witch now dwelt in splendour. Then, when all was prepared, she bade her husband give a grand feast to the King. Now the King had heard much of the mysterious son of seven Queens, and his marvellous wealth, so he gladly accepted the invitation; but what was his astonishment when on entering the palace he found it was a facsimile of his own in every particular! And when his host, richly attired, led him straight to the private hall, where on royal thrones sat the seven Queens, dressed as he had last seen them, he was speechless with surprise, until the Princess, coming forward, threw herself at his feet, and told him the whole story. Then the King awoke from his enchantment, and his anger rose against the wicked white hind who had bewitched him so long, until he could not contain himself. So she was put to death, and her grave ploughed over, and after that the seven Queens returned to their own splendid palace, and everybody lived happily."

Little Two Eyes, because she had two eyes like other people; and the youngest, Little Three Eyes, because she had three eyes, one of them being also in the middle of the forehead. But because Little Two Eyes looked no different from other people her sisters and mother could not bear her. They said, \"You with your two eyes are no better than anybody else; you do not belong to us.\"\n\nThey knocked her about, and gave her shabby clothes, and food which was left over from their own meals; in short, they vexed her whenever they could.\n\nIt happened that Little Two Eyes had to go out into the fields to look after the goat; but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat. She sat down on a hillock and began to cry, and cried so much that a little stream ran down out of each eye. And as she looked up once in her sorrow, a woman stood near her, who asked, \"Little Two Eyes, why do you cry?\"\n\nLittle Two Eyes answered, \"Have I not need to cry? Because I have two eyes, like other people, my sisters and my mother cannot bear me; they push me out of one corner into the other, give me shabby clothes, and nothing to eat but what they leave. To-day they have given me so little that I am still quite hungry.\"\n\nThe wise woman said, \"Little Two Eyes, dry your eyes, and I will tell you something which will keep you from ever being hungry more. Only say to your goat, 'Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,' and a neatly-laid table will stand before you with the most delicious food on it, so that you can eat as much as you like. And when you are satisfied and do not want the table any more, only say, 'Little goat, bleat; little table, away,' and it will all disappear before your eyes. \"Then the wise woman went out of sight.\" Little Two Eyes thought, \"I must try directly if it be true what she has said, for I am much too hungry to wait.\"\n\nSo she said, \"Little goat, bleat; little table, rise;\" and scarcely had she uttered the words, when there stood before her a little table, covered with a white cloth, on which were laid a plate, knife and fork, and silver spoon. The most delicious food was there also, and smoking hot, as if just come from the kitchen. Then Little Two Eyes said the shortest grace that she knew, \"Lord God, be our Guest at all times. Amen,\" began to eat, and found it very good. And when she had had enough, she said as the wise woman had taught her, — \"Little goat, bleat; little table, away.\" In an instant the little table, and all that stood on it, had disappeared again. \"That is a beautiful, easy way of housekeeping,\" thought Little Two Eyes, and was quite happy and merry.\n\nIn the evening, when she came home with her goat, she found a little earthen dish with food, which her sisters had put aside for her, but she did not touch anything — she had no need. On the next day she went out again with her goat, and let the few crusts that were given her remain uneaten. The first time and the second time the sisters took no notice; but when the same thing happened every day, they remarked it, and said, \"All is not right with Little Two Eyes; she always leaves her food, and she used formerly to eat everything that was given her; she must have found other ways of dining.\"\n\nIn order to discover the truth, they resolved that Little One Eye should go with Little Two Eyes when she drove the goat into the meadow, and see what she did there, and if anybody brought her anything to eat and drink. So when Little Two Eyes set out again. Little One Eye came to her and said, \"I will go with you into the field, and see that the goat is taken proper care of, and driven to good pasture.\"\n\nBut Little Two Eyes saw what Little One Eye had in her mind, and drove the goat into long grass, saying, \"Come, Little One Eye, we will sit down; I will sing you something.\" Little One Eye sat down, being tired from the unusual walk and from the heat of the sun, and Little Two Eyes kept on singing, \"Are you awake. Little One Eye? Are you asleep, Little One Eye?\"  Then Little One Eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep. And when Little Two Eyes saw that Little One Eye was fast asleep, and could not betray anything, she said, \"Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,\" and sat herself at her table, and ate and drank till she was satisfied; then she called out again, \"Little goat, bleat; little table, away,\" and instantly everything disappeared.\n\nLittle Two Eyes now woke Little One Eye, and said, \"Little One Eye, you pretend to watch, and fall asleep over it, and in the meantime the goat could have run all over the world; come, we will go home.\" Then they went home, and Little Two Eyes let her little dish again stand untouched; and Little One Eye, who could not tell the mother why her sister would not eat, said, as an excuse, \"Oh, I fell asleep out there.\"\n\nThe next day the mother said to Little Three Eyes, \"This time you shall go and see if Little Two Eyes eats out of doors, and if any one brings her food and drink, for she must eat and drink secretly.\"\n\nThen Little Three Eyes went to Little Two Eyes, and said, \"I will go with you and see if the goat be taken proper care of, and driven to good pasture.\"' But Little Two eyes saw ¦what Little Three Eyes had in her mind, and drove the goat into long grass, and said as before, \"We will sit down here, Little Three Eyes; I will sing you something.\" Little Three Eyes seated herself, being tired from the walk and the heat of the sun, and Little Two Eyes began the same song again, and sang, \"Are you awake. Little Three Eyes ?\"  But instead of singing then as she should, \"Are you asleep. Little Three Eyes ?\" she sang, through carelessness, \"Are you asleep. Little Two Eyes?\" and went on singing, \"Are you awake. Little Three Eyes? Are you asleep. Little Two Eyes ?\"  So the two eyes of Little Three Eyes fell asleep, but the third did not go to sleep, because it was not spoken to by the verse. Little Three Eyes, to be sure, shut it, and made believe to go to sleep, but only through slyness; for she winked with it, and could see everything quite well. And when Little Two Eyes thought that Little Three Eyes was fast asleep, she said her little sentence, \"Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,\" ate and drank heartily and then told the little table to go away again, \"Little goat, bleat; little table, away.\" But Little Three Eyes bad seen everything.\n\nThen Little Two Eyes came to her, woke her, and said, \"Ah! Little Three Eyes, have you been asleep? you keep watch well! come, we will go home.\" And when they got home. Little Two Eyes again did not eat, and Little Three Eyes said to the mother, \"I know why the proud thing does not eat: when she says to the goat out there, 'Little goat, bleat; little table, rise,' there stands a table before her, which is covered with the very best food, much better than we have here; and when she is satisfied, she says, 'Little goat, bleat; little table, away,' and everything is gone again; I have seen it all exactly. She put two of my eyes to sleep with her little verse, but the one in my forehead luckily remained awake.\"\n\nThen the envious mother cried out, \"Shall she be better off than we are?\" fetched a butcher's knife, and stuck it into the goat's heart, so that it fell down dead.\n\nWhen Little Two Eyes saw that, she went out full of grief, seated herself on a hillock, and wept bitter tears. All at once the wise woman stood near her again, and said, \"Little Two Eyes, why do you cry ?\"\n\n\"Shall I not cry ?\"  answered she. \"The goat who every day, when I said your little verse, laid the table so beautifully, has been killed by my mother; now I must suffer hunger and thirst again.\"\n\nThe wise woman said, \"Little Two Eyes, I will give you some good advice; beg your sisters to give you the heart of the murdered goat, and bury it in the ground before the house door, and it will turn out lucky for you.\" Then she disappeared, and Little Two Eyes went home and said to her sisters, \"Dear sisters, give me some part of my goat; I don't ask for anything good, only give me the heart.\"\n\nThen they laughed, and said, \"You can have that, if you do not want anything else.\" Little Two Eyes took the heart, and buried it quietly in the evening, before the house door, after the advice of the wise woman.\n\nNext morning, when the sisters woke, and went to the house door together, there stood a most wonderfully splendid tree, with leaves of silver and fruit of gold hanging between them. Nothing more beautiful or charming could be seen in the wide world. But they did not know how the tree had come there in the night. Little Two Eyes alone noticed that it had grown out of the heart of the goat, for it stood just where she had buried it in the ground.\n\nThen the mother said to Little One Eye, \"Climb up, my child, and gather us some fruit from the tree.\"\n\nLittle One Eye climbed up, but when she wanted to seize a golden apple, the branch sprang out of her hand: this happened every time, so that she could not gather a single apple, though she tried as hard as she could.\n\nThen the mother said, \"Little Three Eyes, do you climb up; you can see better about you with your three eyes than Little One Eye can.\"\n\nLittle One Eye scrambled down, and Little Three Eyes climbed up. But Little Three Eyes ¦was no cleverer, and might look about her as much as she liked — the golden apples always sprang back from her grasp. At last the mother became impatient, and climbed up herself, but could touch the fruit just as little as Little One Eye or Little Three Eyes; she always grasped the empty air.\n\nThen Little Two Eyes said, \"I will go up myself; perhaps I shall prosper better.\"\n\n\"You!\"  cried the sisters. \"With your two eyes, what can you do?\"\n\nBut Little Two Eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did not spring away from her, but dropped of themselves into her hand, so that she could gather one after the other, and brought down a whole apron full. Her mother took them from her, and instead of her sisters. Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes, behaving better to poor Little Two Eyes for it, they were only envious because she alone could get the fruit, and behaved still more cruelly to her.\n\nIt happened, as they stood together by the tree, one day, that a young knight came riding by on a fine horse.\n\n\"Quick, Little Two Eyes,\" cried the two sisters, \"creep under, so that we ma}' not be ashamed of you;\" and threw over poor Little Two Eyes, in a great hurry, an empty cask that stood just by the tree, and pushed also beside her the golden apples which she had broken off.\n\nNow, as the knight came nearer, he proved to be a handsome prince, who stood still, admired the beautiful tree of gold and silver, and said to the two sisters, \"To whom does this beautiful tree belong? She who gives me a branch of it shall have whatever she wishes.\"\n\nThen Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes answered that the tree was theirs, and they would break off a branch for him. Both gave themselves a great deal of trouble, but it was of no use, for the branches and fruit sprang back from them every time. Then the knight said, \"It is very wonderful that the tree belongs to you, and yet you have not the power of gathering anything from it.\"\n\nThey insisted, however, that the tree was their own property. But as they spoke, Little Two Eyes rolled a few golden apples from under the cask, so that they ran to the feet of the knight; for Little Two Eyes was angry that Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes did not tell the truth.\n\nWhen the knight saw the apples, he was astonished, and asked where they came from. Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes answered that they had another sister, who might not, however, show herself, because she had only two e3'es, like other common people. But the knight desired to see her, and called out, \"Little Two Eyes, come out.\" Then Little Two Eyes came out of the cask quite comforted, and the knight was astonished at her great beauty, and said, \"You, Little Two Eyes, can certainly gather me a branch from the tree ?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Little Two Eyes, \"I can do that, for the tree belongs to me.\" And she climbed up and easily broke off a branch, with its silver leaves and golden fruit, and handed it to the knight.\n\nThen the knight said, \"Little Two Eyes, what shall I give you for it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" answered Little Two Eyes, \"I suffer hunger and thirst, sorrow and want, from early morning till late evening; if you would take me with you and free me, I should be happy.\"\n\nThen the knight lifted Little Two Eyes upon his horse, and took her home to his father's castle; there he gave her beautiful clothes, food, and drink, as much as she wanted, and because he loved her so much lie married her, and the marriage was celebrated with great joy.\n\nNow, when Little Two Eyes was taken away by the handsome knight, the two sisters envied her very much her happiness. \"The wonderful tree remains for us, though,\" thought they;\" and even though we cannot gather any fruit off it, everyone will stand still before it, come to us, and praise it.\" But the next morning, the tree had disappeared, and all their hopes with it.\n\nLittle Two Eyes lived happily a long time. Once two poor women came to her at the castle, and begged alms. Then Little Two Eyes looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters. Little One Eye and Little Three Eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about, and seek their bread from door to door. Little Two Eyes, however, bade them welcome, and was very good to them, and took care of them; for they both repented from their hearts the evil they had done to their sister in their youth."

      "body": "Jack The Giant-killer:\n\nIn ancient times the good people of Cornwall were sadly frightened at many wicked giants, who came from different places, robbing and killing all that fell in their way. Amongst them was the giant Cormoran, who had a great castle on a rock which stood in the sea. He often waded through the water and came over to the coast, when all the people would flee before him. After he had feasted himself upon their cattle, he w r ould carry off with him a number of sheep and oxen, slung across his back.\n\nNow there was a very little fellow, named JACK, who was not like other boys, but was as bold and as strong as a man ; and when he was told the shocking things that had been done by Cormoran, he w r ould say to his father quite bravely, \" Shouldn't I like to kill that giant ! \" One night, having heard from his father more sad tales of Cormoran's doings, Jack felt more than ever a wish to kill him ; so by-and-bye he slipped out, and got together a dark lantern, a pickaxe, a shovel, and a horn, and with these he left the house quietly, and came near the giant's castle, which stood on a hill.\n\nJack then dug a huge pit, just at the foot of the hill, over which he strewed sticks and turf, so that it looked like the rest of the ground. At daylight he went to the castle-gate, and blew his horn so loudly that he aroused the giant, who roared out, \" You little villain ! you shall pay dearly for this!\" Down the hill he rushed after Jack, until he came to the bottom, and in a moment tumbled head over heels into the pit. There he stuck fast, Jack all the while crowing over him, and asking him why he did not come out and meet him like a man. Jack then laid hold of his pickaxe, and taking a good aim, struck Cormoran a terrible blow on the crown of his head, which killed him outright.\n\nOne day, when Jack was strolling about, a giant pounced upon him, carried him home in his pocket, and threw him into a room full of bones, telling him to keep quiet while he sharp- ened a knife to kill him with, for he meant to cook him for dinner, if he could get another giant w^ho lived close by to come and dine with him. Jack looked about the room, and found two strong ropes ; he made loops at one end of each, got up to the window, and waited till the two. giants came to the door. Directly they were under the window, he dropped a loop over each head, and quickly threw the ends over a beam, and hoisted them from th *. ground, kicking and strug- gling. Jack then glided down the ropes, and put an end to the giants with his new sharp sword, and let all the prisoners loose.\n\nJack next carrn to a great house, and a giant with two heads asked him to walk in; after supper, he put him in tli3 best bed, but Jack, fearing mischief, kept wide awake. Presently the giant crept softly up to the bed, and banged away upon it with his club, but Jack had put a sack of bran there, that was lying in the room. At breakfast next morning, the giant said, \" Pray how did you sleep?\" \" Pretty well, but for the rats,\" said Jack. The giant then filled two bowls with porridge ; Jack ladled his into a leather bag inside his waistcoat, and then said, \" Look here; see what I can do!\" and cutting the bag, the porridge fell on the floor. \" I can do that too ! \" roared the giant, and with his knife ripped his own stomach up, and died on the spot.\n\nSoon after this, Jack was invited to King Arthur's court, and while he was there the King's son asked him to go with him to attack a huge giant, who was the terror of one part of the country. When the Prince and his little friend arrived at the giant's castle, the former concealed himself behind a tree, while Jack boldly knocked at the c:istle-g\"te. \" Who is there?\" growled a voice of thunder. \"Only a weary traveller,'* said Jack. \" Well, then, what news do you bring'?*' \" Oh, very bad ! King Arthur's son is coming here, with a powerful army, to burn your castle and to put you to death ! \" \" Pray come in, take my keys, and hide me in the deep stone cellar till they are gone.\" As soon as the giant was safe under lock and key, Jack let the Prince and his followers into the castle, and they set to work to brick up the entrance to the stone cellar, so that the giant was soon starved to death.\n\nThe Prince rewarded Jack with many precious gifts, and amongst these was his own sword, which he begged his little companion to wear for his sake, arid to use it in destroying wicked giants wherever he should encounter them. After parting from the Prince, Jack passed near a forest, and fancied he heard groans coming from the trees. On drawing near he saw a huge giant dragging by the hair a knight and lady whom he had captured. Jack had now a fair chance for making use of the sword the Prince had given him, and hav- ing quietly approached, he dealt the giant so well aimed a blow across the legs that he fell to the ground, when Jack quickly despatched him, and released the captives.\n\nJack learned that the giant just killed by him had a brother with a hideous great head on a small body, who was so savago that the very sight of him, with his frightful club covered with iron spikes, was enough to terrify people to death. Although this monster was almost more than his match, Jack was not daunted, and he watched at the mouth of the cave where the giant lived, until he should come out. And he did come out by-arid-by, with a horrid roar, rolling his great eyes, and grinding his teeth; Jack then, by a thrust through his right arm, disabled him, and after this he soon found an opportunity to finish him.\n\nAfter this the Knight and his lady invited Jack to their castle, where they gave a grand feast in his honour. But while they were all enjoying themselves, a servant, who could scarcely speak for fright, came to say that a fierce giant with two heads, named Thundel, was coming, and that he was now very close. At this even the bravest of the knights present shook with fear ; but Jack told them to take courage, and he would show them how to deal with the giant. He then ordered the drawbridge, which crossed the moat that ran round the Knight's castle, to be nearly sawn through. By this time the giant had arrived, and Jack went out to meet him. After leading him a dance round the castle, so that all the lords and ladies might see him, Jack ran lightly over the drawbridge. The giant attempted to follow him, but the bridge, being sawn in the middle, gave way beneath his immense weight, and he fell plump into the water, where Jack soon made an end of him.\n\nThere now remained only one giant to be got rid of, who held a Duke's daughter among his captives. Jack was de- termined to rescue this fair lady, although it was a task of very great danger, for the giant's gate was guarded by two fiery dragons, at the sight of which hideous monsters he for the first time, felt a little afraid. But this did not last long ; he soon took courage again, and coming close up to the gate, found there was a huge horn, under which these words were written\n\n\"Whoever can this trumpet blow \"Will cause the giant's overthrow.\n\nJack now took a long breath, and manfully blew the horn ; the gates flew open, and in a moment the giant, his castle, and the dragons turned into a blue mist, and were no more to be seen. Nothing remained but the captives : amongst these was the Duke's beautiful daughter, who soon after was given by her father in marriage to our brave little hero, JACK, a reward he fully deserved, for being so famous a GIANT-KILLER."

      "body": "Puss in Boots:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a miller who had three sons. When he died he left his mill to the eldest son, his ass to the second son, and his cat to the youngest, who had always been his favourite.\n\nThe two eldest sons resolved to live together; but they would not let their brother live with them, because he had only a cat. So the poor lad was very sorrowful, and wondered what he should do to get his bread. While he was sitting thinking about it, Puss jumped up on the table, and touched him with her paw.\n\n “My dear master,” she said, “do not fret. I will get your living for you. Only you must buy me a pair of boots and give me a bag.”\n\n The miller’s son had very little money, but he thought it such a wonderful thing to hear a cat talk that he could not refuse her request. So he took Puss to the shoemaker’s, and got him to make her a very smart pair of boots, and then he gave her a nice large bag.\n\nTHE RABBIT WARREN.\n\nNow, not far from the mill there was a rabbit warren, and Puss resolved to catch some rabbits for dinner. So she put some lettuce leaves and fine parsley into her bag, went into the warren, and held the bag very quietly open, hiding herself behind it. And little greedy rabbits, who knew no better, ran into it, to have a feast. Directly they were safe in, Puss pulled the string of the bag, and carried them off to her master. The miller’s son killed them, and cooked one for dinner; but Puss took away the other, which was a very fine one, and hung it up for their next day’s meal.\n\nBut although their larder was thus provided, early the next day Puss took her bag and went again into the warren, and in the same manner caught two more fine young rabbits. But instead of carrying them home she walked to the king’s palace and knocked at the door.\n\nPUSS AT THE PALACE.\n\nThe king’s porter asked who was there. “I have brought a present to the king,” said Puss. “Please let me see his majesty.”\n\nThe porter let her in, and when Puss came into the king’s presence she made a low bow, and, taking a fine rabbit out of her bag, said, “My Lord Marquis of Carrabas sends this rabbit to your majesty with his respects.”\n\n “I am much obliged to the marquis,” said the king, and he ordered his head cook to dress the rabbit for dinner.\n\n By the king’s side sat his daughter, a very beautiful lady. She ordered one of the attendants to give Puss a good cup of cream, which she liked very much; and she went home and told her master all she had done. The miller’s son laughed; but every morning Puss caught a rabbit, and carried it to the palace with the same message.\n\nTHE OGRE.\n\nNow, in that country there lived a cruel ogre, who used to eat children, so everybody was afraid of him; but nobody could kill him, he was such a giant. One day Puss went to call on him. He received her civilly, for he did not care to eat cats, so Puss sat down, and began to talk:—”I hear,” she said, “great Ogre, that you are so clever, that you can turn yourself into any creature you please.”\n\n“Yes, so I can,” said the ogre.\n\n“Dear me,” said Puss, “how much I should like to see your ogreship do it.”\n\nThen the ogre, who liked to show how clever he was, turned himself into a lion, and roared so loudly that Puss was quite frightened, and jumped out of the way. Then he changed back into an ogre again. Puss praised him a great deal, and then said, “Can your ogreship become a small animal as well as a large one?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” said the vain ogre; and he changed himself into a little mouse. Directly Puss saw him in this form she jumped at him and killed him on the spot.\n\nTHE MARQUIS OF CARRABAS.\n\nThen Puss ran home and bade her master go and bathe in the river, and he should see what she would do for him. The miller’s son obeyed; and while he was in the water, Puss took away all his clothes, and hid them under a large stone. Now, the king’s carriage came in sight soon after, just as Puss had expected, for he always drove in that direction, and directly she saw it, she began to cry very loudly, “Help, help, for my Lord the Marquis of Carrabas.” The king put his head out, and asked what was the matter.\n\n “Oh, your majesty,” said Puss, “my master the marquis was bathing, and some one has taken away his clothes. He will catch the cramp and be drowned.”\n\n Then the king ordered one of his attendants to ride back to the palace and get a suit of his own clothes for the marquis, “who had so often sent him gifts,” he said. And when they were brought, Puss took them to her master, and helped him to dress in them.\n\nPUSS FRIGHTENS THE REAPERS.\n\nThe miller’s son looked quite like a gentleman in the king’s clothes, and when he went to thank his majesty for them, the king asked him to get into the coach and he would drive him home. Then Puss told the coachman where to go, and ran on before and came to some reapers. “Reapers,” said she, “if the king asks you whose field this is, say it belongs to the Marquis of Carrabas; if you don’t say so, you shall be chopped up as small as mincemeat.”\n\nThe reapers were so frightened that they promised to obey her. And she ran on and told all the other labourers on the road to say the same. So when the king asked, “To whom do these fine fields belong?” the reapers answered, “To the Marquis of Carrabas.” The herdsmen said the same of the cattle, and the king, turning to the miller’s son, said, “My lord, you have a fine property.” But all had belonged really to the ogre, for it was to his castle the cunning cat had told the coachman to drive.\n\nTHE CASTLE.\n\nAt last the coach stopped at the Ogre’s castle, and Puss came out, and bowing very low, said, “Your majesty and the princess are welcome to the castle of my Lord Marquis of Carrabas.”\n\n The king was delighted, for it was indeed a very nice castle, full of riches. They sat down to a great feast, which Puss ordered to be served, and the king was so pleased with the miller’s son and thought him such a good match for the princess, that he invited him to court, and in a little while gave him his daughter for his wife, and made him a prince.\n\n You may be quite sure that the miller’s son was very grateful to Puss for his good fortune, and she never had to catch mice for her dinner any more, for dainty meat and the best cream were every day given to Puss in Boots."

      "body": "The Bats:\n\nLong ago, a fierce fighting broke out between the beasts and the birds. The birds pecked at the beasts and flew away. The beasts were helpless as the birds used to fly out of their reach after pecking at them. This battle went on for many days. The bats on their part kept themselves aloof. They didn't join either the birds or the beasts. They preferred to go with the winner. They thought to themselves: \"Ours is a special position, we're birds because we can fly, we're beasts because we don't lay eggs\". The bats only watched the birds and the beasts fight with each other.\n\nSo the fighting went on. Seeing the birds in a winning position, the bats would join the birds, and the next time they would support the beasts, because the beasts seemed to be winning.\n\nOn the other hand, the birds and the beasts seemed to have become tired of their continuous battle. So, they decided to make peace. The king of birds and the king of beasts both sat together to find out some way to a permanent peace. Ultimately, both of them decided to forget the past and become good friends. They also decided not to allow the bats community either to join the birds or the beasts, because they were opportunists.\n\nAt last, the bats were left alone. They felt ashamed of themselves. They hid themselves in the dark caves and crevices. They came out of their hiding only at twilight-when the birds were back to their nests and the beasts were not yet out of their dens.\n\nMoral: One should avoid fair-weather friends."

Now the King, though he felt that he was growing old, did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well, so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them.\n\nSo he sent for them all, and, after speaking to them kindly, he added:\n\n\"You will quite agree with me, my dear children, that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did. I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects, therefore I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me. Now, as I think of retiring into the country, it seems to me that a pretty, lively, faithful little dog would be very good company for me; so, without any regard for your ages, I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once.\"\n\nThe three Princes were greatly surprised by their father's sudden fancy for a little dog, but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise have had of being king, and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection, they accepted the commission with pleasure. They bade farewell to the King, who gave them presents of silver and precious stones, and appointed to meet them at the same hour, in the same place, after a year had passed, to see the little dogs they had brought for him.\n\nThen they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city, accompanied by all their particular friends, to whom they gave a grand banquet, and the three brothers promised to be friends always, to share whatever good fortune befell them, and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy; and so they set out, agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time, to present themselves before the King together. Each one took a different road, and the two eldest met with many adventures; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear. He was young, and gay, and handsome, and knew everything that a prince ought to know; and as for his courage, there was simply no end to it.\n\nHardly a day passed without his buying several dogs—big and little, greyhounds, mastiffs, spaniels, and lapdogs. As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier, and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one, as, being alone, he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him. He journeyed from day to day, not knowing where he was going, until at last, just at nightfall, he reached a great, gloomy forest. He did not know his way, and, to make matters worse, it began to thunder, and the rain poured down. He took the first path he could find, and after walking for a long time he fancied he saw a faint light, and began to hope that he was coming to some cottage where he might find shelter for the night. At length, guided by the light, he reached the door of the most splendid castle he could have imagined. This door was of gold covered with carbuncles, and it was the pure red light which shone from them that had shown him the way through the forest. The walls were of the finest porcelain in all the most delicate colors, and the Prince saw that all the stories he had ever read were pictured upon them; but as he was terribly wet, and the rain still fell in torrents, he could not stay to look about any more, but came back to the golden door. There he saw a deer's foot hanging by a chain of diamonds, and he began to wonder who could live in this magnificent castle.\n\n\"They must feel very secure against robbers,\" he said to himself. \"What is to hinder anyone from cutting off that chain and digging out those carbuncles, and making himself rich for life?\"\n\nHe pulled the deer's foot, and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open, but the Prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air, each holding a torch. He was so much surprised that he stood quite still, until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands, so that, though he was somewhat uneasy, he could not help going on. With his hand on his sword, to be prepared for whatever might happen, he entered a hall paved with lapis-lazuli, while two lovely voices sang:\n\n\"The hands you see floating above\nWill swiftly your bidding obey;\nIf your heart dreads not conquering Love,\nIn this place you may fearlessly stay.\"\n\nThe Prince could not believe that any danger threatened him when he was welcomed in this way, so, guided by the mysterious hands, he went toward a door of coral, which opened of its own accord, and he found himself in a vast hall of mother-of-pearl, out of which opened a number of other rooms, glittering with thousands of lights, and full of such beautiful pictures and precious things that the Prince felt quite bewildered. After passing through sixty rooms the hands that conducted him stopped, and the Prince saw a most comfortable-looking arm-chair drawn up close to the chimney-corner; at the same moment the fire lighted itself, and the pretty, soft, clever hands took off the Prince's wet, muddy clothes, and presented him with fresh ones made of the richest stuffs, all embroidered with gold and emeralds. He could not help admiring everything he saw, and the deft way in which the hands waited on him, though they sometimes appeared so suddenly that they made him jump.\n\nWhen he was quite ready—and I can assure you that he looked very different from the wet and weary Prince who had stood outside in the rain, and pulled the deer's foot—the hands led him to a splendid room, upon the walls of which were painted the histories of Puss in Boots and a number of other famous cats. The table was laid for supper with two golden plates, and golden spoons and forks, and the sideboard was covered with dishes and glasses of crystal set with precious stones. The Prince was wondering who the second place could be for, when suddenly in came about a dozen cats carrying guitars and rolls of music, who took their places at one end of the room, and under the direction of a cat who beat time with a roll of paper began to mew in every imaginable key, and to draw their claws across the strings of the guitars, making the strangest kind of music that could be heard. The Prince hastily stopped up his ears, but even then the sight of these comical musicians sent him into fits of laughter.\n\n\"What funny thing shall I see next?\" he said to himself, and instantly the door opened, and in came a tiny figure covered by a long black veil. It was conducted by two cats wearing black mantles and carrying swords, and a large party of cats followed, who brought in cages full of rats and mice.\n\nThe Prince was so much astonished that he thought he must be dreaming, but the little figure came up to him and threw back its veil, and he saw that it was the loveliest little white cat it is possible to imagine. She looked very young and very sad, and in a sweet little voice that went straight to his heart she said to the Prince:\n\n\"King's son, you are welcome; the Queen of the Cats is glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Lady Cat,\" replied the Prince, \"I thank you for receiving me so kindly, but surely you are no ordinary pussy-cat? Indeed, the way you speak and the magnificence of your castle prove it plainly.\"\n\n\"King's son,\" said the White Cat, \"I beg you to spare me these compliments, for I am not used to them. But now,\" she added, \"let supper be served, and let the musicians be silent, as the Prince does not understand what they are saying.\"\n\nSo the mysterious hands began to bring in the supper, and first they put on the table two dishes, one containing stewed pigeons and the other a fricassee of fat mice. The sight of the latter made the Prince feel as if he could not enjoy his supper at all; but the White Cat, seeing this, assured him that the dishes intended for him were prepared in a separate kitchen, and he might be quite certain that they contained neither rats nor mice; and the Prince felt so sure that she would not deceive him that he had no more hesitation in beginning. Presently he noticed that on the little paw that was next him the White Cat wore a bracelet containing a portrait, and he begged to be allowed to look at it. To his great surprise he found it represented an extremely handsome young man, who was so like himself that it might have been his own portrait! The White Cat sighed as he looked at it, and seemed sadder than ever, and the Prince dared not ask any questions for fear of displeasing her; so he began to talk about other things, and found that she was interested in all the subjects he cared for himself, and seemed to know quite well what was going on in the world. After supper they went into another room, which was fitted up as a theatre, and the cats acted and danced for their amusement, and then the White Cat said good-night to him, and the hands conducted him into a room he had not seen before, hung with tapestry worked with butterflies' wings of every color; there were mirrors that reached from the ceiling to the floor, and a little white bed with curtains of gauze tied up with ribbons. The Prince went to bed in silence, as he did not quite know how to begin a conversation with the hands that waited on him, and in the morning he was awakened by a noise and confusion outside of his window, and the hands came and quickly dressed him in hunting costume. When he looked out all the cats were assembled in the courtyard, some leading greyhounds, some blowing horns, for the White Cat was going out hunting. The hands led a wooden horse up to the Prince, and seemed to expect him to mount it, at which he was very indignant; but it was no use for him to object, for he speedily found himself upon its back, and it pranced gaily off with him.\n\nThe White Cat herself was riding a monkey, which climbed even up to the eagles' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets. Never was there a pleasanter hunting party, and when they returned to the castle the Prince and the White Cat supped together as before, but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet, which must have contained a magic draught, for, as soon as he had swallowed its contents, he forgot everything, even the little dog that he was seeking for the King, and only thought how happy he was to be with the White Cat! And so the days passed, in every kind of amusement, until the year was nearly gone. The Prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers: he did not even know what country he belonged to; but the White Cat knew when he ought to go back, and one day she said to him:\n\n\"Do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father, and your brothers have found lovely ones?\"\n\nThen the Prince suddenly recovered his memory, and cried:\n\n\"What can have made me forget such an important thing? My whole fortune depends upon it; and even if I could in such a short time find a dog pretty enough to gain me a kingdom, where should I find a horse who would carry me all that way in three days?\" And he began to be very vexed. But the White Cat said to him: \"King's son, do not trouble yourself; I am your friend, and will make everything easy for you. You can still stay here for a day, as the good wooden horse can take you to your country in twelve hours.\"\n\n\"I thank you, beautiful Cat,\" said the Prince; \"but what good will it do me to get back if I have not a dog to take to my father?\"\n\n\"See here,\" answered the White Cat, holding up an acorn; \"there is a prettier one in this than in the Dogstar!\"\n\n\"Oh! White Cat dear,\" said the Prince, \"how unkind you are to laugh at me now!\"  \"Only listen,\" she said, holding the acorn to his ear.\n\nAnd inside it he distinctly heard a tiny voice say: \"Bow-wow!\"\n\nThe Prince was delighted, for a dog that can be shut up in an acorn must be very small indeed. He wanted to take it out and look at it, but the White Cat said it would be better not to open the acorn till he was before the King, in case the tiny dog should be cold on the journey. He thanked her a thousand times, and said good-by quite sadly when the time came for him to set out.\n\n\"The days have passed so quickly with you,\" he said, \"I only wish I could take you with me now.\"\n\nBut the White Cat shook her head and sighed deeply in answer.\n\nAfter all the Prince was the first to arrive at the castle where he had agreed to meet his brothers, but they came soon after, and stared in amazement when they saw the wooden horse in the courtyard jumping like a hunter.\n\nThe Prince met them joyfully, and they began to tell him all their adventures; but he managed to hide from them what he had been doing, and even led them to think that a turnspit dog which he had with him was the one he was bringing for the King. Fond as they all were of one another, the two eldest could not help being glad to think that their dogs certainly had a better chance. The next morning they started in the same chariot. The elder brothers carried in baskets two such tiny, fragile dogs that they hardly dared to touch them. As for the turnspit, he ran after the chariot, and got so covered with mud that one could hardly see what he was like at all. When they reached the palace everyone crowded round to welcome them as they went into the King's great hall; and when the two brothers presented their little dogs nobody could decide which was the prettier. They were already arranging between themselves to share the kingdom equally, when the youngest stepped forward, drawing from his pocket the acorn the White Cat had given him. He opened it quickly, and there upon a white cushion they saw a dog so small that it could easily have been put through a ring. The Prince laid it upon the ground, and it got up at once and began to dance. The King did not know what to say, for it was impossible that anything could be prettier than this little creature. Nevertheless, as he was in no hurry to part with his crown, he told his sons that, as they had been so successful the first time, he would ask them to go once again, and seek by land and sea for a piece of muslin so fine that it could be drawn through the eye of a needle. The brothers were not very willing to set out again, but the two eldest consented because it gave them another chance, and they started as before. The youngest again mounted the wooden horse, and rode back at full speed to his beloved White Cat. Every door of the castle stood wide open, and every window and turret was illuminated, so it looked more wonderful than before. The hands hastened to meet him, and led the wooden horse off to the stable, while he hurried in to find the White Cat. She was asleep in a little basket on a white satin cushion, but she very soon started up when she heard the Prince, and was overjoyed at seeing him once more.\n\n\"How could I hope that you would come back to me King's son?\" she said. And then he stroked and petted her, and told her of his successful journey, and how he had come back to ask her help, as he believed that it was impossible to find what the King demanded. The White Cat looked serious, and said she must think what was to be done, but that, luckily, there were some cats in the castle who could spin very well, and if anybody could manage it they could, and she would set them the task herself.\n\nAnd then the hands appeared carrying torches, and conducted the Prince and the White Cat to a long gallery which overlooked the river, from the windows of which they saw a magnificent display of fireworks of all sorts; after which they had supper, which the Prince liked even better than the fireworks, for it was very late, and he was hungry after his long ride. And so the days passed quickly as before; it was impossible to feel dull with the White Cat, and she had quite a talent for inventing new amusements—indeed, she was cleverer than a cat has any right to be. But when the Prince asked her how it was that she was so wise, she only said:\n\n\"King's son, do not ask me; guess what you please. I may not tell you anything.\"\n\nThe Prince was so happy that he did not trouble himself at all about the time, but presently the White Cat told him that the year was gone, and that he need not be at all anxious about the piece of muslin, as they had made it very well.\n\n\"This time,\" she added, \"I can give you a suitable escort\"; and on looking out into the courtyard the Prince saw a superb chariot of burnished gold, enameled in flame color with a thousand different devices. It was drawn by twelve snow-white horses, harnessed four abreast; their trappings were flame-colored velvet, embroidered with diamonds. A hundred chariots followed, each drawn by eight horses, and filled with officers in splendid uniforms, and a thousand guards surrounded the procession. \"Go!\" said the White Cat, \"and when you appear before the King in such state he surely will not refuse you the crown which you deserve. Take this walnut, but do not open it until you are before him, then you will find in it the piece of stuff you asked me for.\"\n\n\"Lovely Blanchette,\" said the Prince, \"how can I thank you properly for all your kindness to me? Only tell me that you wish it, and I will give up for ever all thought of being king, and will stay here with you always.\"\n\n\"King's son,\" she replied, \"it shows the goodness of your heart that you should care so much for a little white cat, who is good for nothing but to catch mice; but you must not stay.\"\n\nSo the Prince kissed her little paw and set out. You can imagine how fast he traveled when I tell you that they reached the King's palace in just half the time it had taken the wooden horse to get there. This time the Prince was so late that he did not try to meet his brothers at their castle, so they thought he could not be coming, and were rather glad of it, and displayed their pieces of muslin to the King proudly, feeling sure of success. And indeed the stuff was very fine, and would go through the eye of a very large needle; but the King, who was only too glad to make a difficulty, sent for a particular needle, which was kept among the Crown jewels, and had such a small eye that everybody saw at once that it was impossible that the muslin should pass through it. The Princes were angry, and were beginning to complain that it was a trick, when suddenly the trumpets sounded and the youngest Prince came in. His father and brothers were quite astonished at his magnificence, and after he had greeted them he took the walnut from his pocket and opened it, fully expecting to find the piece of muslin, but instead there was only a hazel-nut. He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone. Everybody was looking on, and the King was chuckling to himself at the idea of finding the piece of muslin in a nutshell.\n\nHowever, the Prince cracked the cherry-stone, but everyone laughed when he saw it contained only its own kernel. He opened that and found a grain of wheat, and in that was a millet seed. Then he himself began to wonder, and muttered softly:\n\n\"White Cat, White Cat, are you making fun of me?\"\n\nIn an instant he felt a cat's claw give his hand quite a sharp scratch, and hoping that it was meant as an encouragement he opened the millet seed, and drew out of it a piece of muslin four hundred ells long, woven with the loveliest colors and most wonderful patterns; and when the needle was brought it went through the eye six times with the greatest ease! The King turned pale, and the other Princes stood silent and sorrowful, for nobody could deny that this was the most marvelous piece of muslin that was to be found in the world.\n\nPresently the King turned to his sons, and said, with a deep sigh:\n\n\"Nothing could console me more in my old age than to realize your willingness to gratify my wishes. Go then once more, and whoever at the end of a year can bring back the loveliest princess shall be married to her, and shall, without further delay, receive the crown, for my successor must certainly be married.\" The Prince considered that he had earned the kingdom fairly twice over but still he was too well bred to argue about it, so he just went back to his gorgeous chariot, and, surrounded by his escort, returned to the White Cat faster than he had come. This time she was expecting him, the path was strewn with flowers, and a thousand braziers were burning scented woods which perfumed the air. Seated in a gallery from which she could see his arrival, the White Cat waited for him. \"Well, King's son,\" she said, \"here you are once more, without a crown.\" \"Madam,\" said he, \"thanks to your generosity I have earned one twice over; but the fact is that my father is so loth to part with it that it would be no pleasure to me to take it.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" she answered, \"it's just as well to try and deserve it. As you must take back a lovely princess with you next time I will be on the look-out for one for you. In the meantime let us enjoy ourselves; to-night I have ordered a battle between my cats and the river rats on purpose to amuse you.\" So this year slipped away even more pleasantly than the preceding ones. Sometimes the Prince could not help asking the White Cat how it was she could talk.\n\n\"Perhaps you are a fairy,\" he said. \"Or has some enchanter changed you into a cat?\"\n\nBut she only gave him answers that told him nothing. Days go by so quickly when one is very happy that it is certain the Prince would never have thought of its being time to go back, when one evening as they sat together the White Cat said to him that if he wanted to take a lovely princess home with him the next day he must be prepared to do what she told him.\n\n\"Take this sword,\" she said, \"and cut off my head!\"\n\n\"I!\" cried the Prince, \"I cut off your head! Blanchette darling, how could I do it?\"\n\n\"I entreat you to do as I tell you, King's son,\" she replied.\n\nThe tears came into the Prince's eyes as he begged her to ask him anything but that—to set him any task she pleased as a proof of his devotion, but to spare him the grief of killing his dear Pussy. But nothing he could say altered her determination, and at last he drew his sword, and desperately, with a trembling hand, cut off the little white head. But imagine his astonishment and delight when suddenly a lovely princess stood before him, and, while he was still speechless with amazement, the door opened and a goodly company of knights and ladies entered, each carrying a cat's skin! They hastened with every sign of joy to the Princess, kissing her hand and congratulating her on being once more restored to her natural shape. She received them graciously, but after a few minutes begged that they would leave her alone with the Prince, to whom she said:\n\n\"You see, Prince, that you were right in supposing me to be no ordinary cat. My father reigned over six kingdoms. The Queen, my mother, whom he loved dearly, had a passion for traveling and exploring, and when I was only a few weeks old she obtained his permission to visit a certain mountain of which she had heard many marvelous tales, and set out, taking with her a number of her attendants. On the way they had to pass near an old castle belonging to the fairies. Nobody had ever been into it, but it was reported to be full of the most wonderful things, and my mother remembered to have heard that the fairies had in their garden such fruits as were to be seen and tasted nowhere else. She began to wish to try them for herself, and turned her steps in the direction of the garden. On arriving at the door, which blazed with gold and jewels, she ordered her servants to knock loudly, but it was useless; it seemed as if all the inhabitants of the castle must be asleep or dead. Now the more difficult it became to obtain the fruit, the more the Queen was determined that have it she would. So she ordered that they should bring ladders, and get over the wall into the garden; but though the wall did not look very high, and they tied the ladders together to make them very long, it was quite impossible to get to the top.\n\n\"The Queen was in despair, but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were, and went to bed herself, feeling quite ill, she was so disappointed. In the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened, and saw to her surprise a tiny, ugly old woman seated by her bedside, who said to her:\n\n\"'I must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your Majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit; but to save you annoyance, my sisters and I will consent to give you as much as you can carry away, on one condition—that is, that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own.'\n\n\"'Ah! my dear madam,' cried the Queen, 'is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit? I will give you my kingdoms willingly.'\n\n\"'No,' replied the old fairy, 'we will have nothing but your little daughter. She shall be as happy as the day is long, and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy-land, but you must not see her again until she is married.'\n\n\"'Though it is a hard condition,' said the Queen, 'I consent, for I shall certainly die if I do not taste the fruit, and so I should lose my little daughter either way.'\n\n\"So the old fairy led her into the castle, and, though it was still the middle of the night, the Queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told, which you can easily believe, Prince,\" said the White Cat, \"when I tell you that it was this castle that we are now in. 'Will you gather the fruit yourself, Queen?' said the old fairy, 'or shall I call it to come to you?'\n\n\"'I beg you to let me see it come when it is called,' cried the Queen; 'that will be something quite new.' The old fairy whistled twice, then she cried:\n\n\"'Apricots, peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums, pears, melons, grapes, apples, oranges, lemons, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, come!'\n\n\"And in an instant they came tumbling in one over another, and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt, and the Queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them. You see they grew upon fairy trees.\n\n\"The old fairy gave her golden baskets in which to take the fruit away, and it was as much as four hundred mules could carry. Then she reminded the Queen of her agreement, and led her back to the camp, and next morning she went back to her kingdom, but before she had gone very far she began to repent of her bargain, and when the King came out to meet her she looked so sad that he guessed that something had happened, and asked what was the matter. At first the Queen was afraid to tell him, but when, as soon as they reached the palace, five frightful little dwarfs were sent by the fairies to fetch me, she was obliged to confess what she had promised. The King was very angry, and had the Queen and myself shut up in a great tower and safely guarded, and drove the little dwarfs out of his kingdom; but the fairies sent a great dragon who ate up all the people he met, and whose breath burnt up everything as he passed through the country; and at last, after trying in vain to rid himself of this monster, the King, to save his subjects, was obliged to consent that I should be given up to the fairies. This time they came themselves to fetch me, in a chariot of pearl drawn by sea-horses, followed by the dragon, who was led with chains of diamonds. My cradle was placed between the old fairies, who loaded me with caresses, and away we whirled through the air to a tower which they had built on purpose for me. There I grew up surrounded with everything that was beautiful and rare, and learning everything that is ever taught to a princess, but without any companions but a parrot and a little dog, who could both talk; and receiving every day a visit from one of the old fairies, who came mounted upon the dragon. One day, however, as I sat at my window I saw a handsome young prince, who seemed to have been hunting in the forest which surrounded my prison, and who was standing and looking up at me. When he saw that I observed him he saluted me with great deference. You can imagine that I was delighted to have some one new to talk to, and in spite of the height of my window our conversation was prolonged till night fell, then my prince reluctantly bade me farewell. But after that he came again many times and at last I consented to marry him, but the question was how was I to escape from my tower. The fairies always supplied me with flax for my spinning, and by great diligence I made enough cord for a ladder that would reach to the foot of the tower; but, alas! just as my prince was helping me to descend it, the crossest and ugliest of the old fairies flew in. Before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon. As for me, the fairies, furious at having their plans defeated, for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs, and I utterly refused, changed me into a white cat. When they brought me here I found all the lords and ladies of my father's court awaiting me under the same enchantment, while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible, all but their hands.\n\n\"As they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history, for until then I had quite believed that I was their child, and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover.\n\n\"And you have won it, lovely Princess,\" interrupted the Prince.\n\n\"You are indeed wonderfully like him,\" resumed the Princess—\"in voice, in features, and everything; and if you really love me all my troubles will be at an end.\"\n\n\"And mine too,\" cried the Prince, throwing himself at her feet, \"if you will consent to marry me.\"\n\n\"I love you already better than anyone in the world,\" she said; \"but now it is time to go back to your father, and we shall hear what he says about it.\"\n\nSo the Prince gave her his hand and led her out, and they mounted the chariot together; it was even more splendid than before, and so was the whole company. Even the horses' shoes were of rubies with diamond nails, and I suppose that is the first time such a thing was ever seen.\n\nAs the Princess was as kind and clever as she was beautiful, you may imagine what a delightful journey the Prince found it, for everything the Princess said seemed to him quite charming.\n\nWhen they came near the castle where the brothers were to meet, the Princess got into a chair carried by four of the guards; it was hewn out of one splendid crystal, and had silken curtains, which she drew round her that she might not be seen.\n\nThe Prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace, each with a lovely princess, and they came to meet him, asking if he had also found a wife. He said that he had found something much rarer—a white cat! At which they laughed very much, and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up by mice in the palace. And then they set out together for the town. Each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage; the horses were decked with plumes of feathers, and glittered with gold. After them came the youngest prince, and last of all the crystal chair, at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity. When the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the King.\n\n\"Are the ladies beautiful?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nAnd when they answered that nobody had ever before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed.\n\nHowever, he received them graciously, but found it impossible to choose between them.\n\nThen turning to his youngest son he said:\n\n\"Have you come back alone, after all?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" replied the Prince, \"will find in that crystal chair a little white cat, which has such soft paws, and mews so prettily, that I am sure you will be charmed with it.\"\n\nThe King smiled, and went to draw back the curtains himself, but at a touch from the Princess the crystal shivered into a thousand splinters, and there she stood in all her beauty; her fair hair floated over her shoulders and was crowned with flowers, and her softly falling robe was of the purest white. She saluted the King gracefully, while a murmur of admiration rose from all around.\n\n\"Sire,\" she said, \"I am not come to deprive you of the throne you fill so worthily. I have already six kingdoms, permit me to bestow one upon you, and upon each of your sons. I ask nothing but your friendship, and your consent to my marriage with your youngest son; we shall still have three kingdoms left for ourselves.\"\n\nThe King and all the courtiers could not conceal their joy and astonishment, and the marriage of the three Princes was celebrated at once. The festivities lasted several months, and then each king and queen departed to their own kingdom and lived happily ever after."

      "body": "The Thief And The Sanyasi:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a Sanyasi in a Matha. His name was Dev Sharma. He was a learned man. Many people used to visit him for his valuable preachings and advices on important matters. They presented valuables and money to Dev Sharma. After sometime, Dev Sharma became very rich. The wealth he had amassed, became a great source of worry for him. He had to guard his wealth with great care. He always kept the money - bag under his armpit and never parted with it.\n\nOnce a thief whose name was Ashadhbhuti, came to know of Sanyasi's wealth. He made a plan to steal it. And in order to materialise his plan Ashadhbhuti approached Dev Sharma and expressed his desire to become his disciple.\n\n\"Om Namaha Shivaya\", said Ashadhbhuti. \"Gurudev, I'm tired of this worldly pleasure. Please accept me as one of your disciples and teach me the way to attain 'Moksha’.”\n\n\"My child\", said the Sanyasi, \"I'm pleased with your words.\" The Sanyasi then performed some rituals to make Ashadhbhuti his disciple.\n\nNow Ashadhbhuti messaged his Guru's hands and feet and waited upon him to wangle his affection and favour. But the Sanyasi didn't seem to fully trust Ashadhbhuti, because he never allowed him to enter the Matha at night. He also never parted with his money - bag. This was disappointing for Ashadhbhuti. But he didn't give up.\n\nOne day, the Sanyasi was invited to a nearby village to perform ceremony of sacred thread at one of his disciple's house.\n\nThe Sanyasi took the thief along with him. On the way, they came across a river. There Sanyasi folded his money - bag in his robe and said to his disciple, \"Ashadhbhuti, look after this bag very carefully while I take my bath in the river.\"\n\nAfter sometime, the Sanyasi returned having finished his holy bath.

      "body": "The Adventures Of Kintaro, The Golden Boy:\n\nLong, long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki. Now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her. Not long after this, through the malice of some of his friends, he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed. This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal--he died, leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone. \n\nFearing her husband's enemies, she fled to the Ashigara Mountains as soon as her husband was dead, and there in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters, a little boy was born to her. She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy. Now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength, and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger, so that by the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters. \n\nThen his mother gave him a large ax, and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters, who called him \"Wonder-child,\" and his mother the \"Old Nurse of the Mountains,\" for they did not know her high rank. Another favorite pastime of Kintaro's was to smash up rocks and stones. You can imagine how strong he was!\n\nQuite unlike other boys, Kintaro, grew up all alone in the mountain wilds, and as he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk. By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon Kintaro as their master, and he used them as his servants and messengers. But his special retainers were the bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare.\n\nThe bear often brought her cubs for Kintaro to romp with, and when she came to take them home Kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave. He was very fond of the deer too, and would often put his arms round the creature's neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him. Great was the fun they all had together.\n\nOne day, as usual, Kintaro went up into the mountains, followed by the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare. After walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads, they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers.\n\nHere, indeed, was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together. The deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure, the monkey scratched his back, the hare smoothed his long ears, and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction.\n\nKintaro said, \"Here is a place for a good game. What do you all say to a wrestling match?\"\n\nThe bear being the biggest and the oldest, answered for the others:\n\n\"That will be great fun,\" said she. \"I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform for the wrestlers;\" and she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape.\n\n\"All right,\" said Kintaro, \"I will look on while you all wrestle with each other. I shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round.\"\n\n\"What fun! we shall all try to get the prize,\" said the bear.\n\nThe deer, the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle. When this was finished, Kintaro cried out:\n\n\"Now begin! the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire. Now, Mr. Deer, you are to be umpire!\"\n\n\"He, he!\" answered the deer. \"I will be umpire. Now, Mr. Monkey and Mr. Hare, if you are both ready, please walk out and take your places on the platform.\"\n\nThen the monkey and the hare both hopped out, quickly and nimbly, to the wrestling platform. The deer, as umpire, stood between the two and called out:\n\n\"Red-back! Red-back!\" (this to the monkey, who has a red back in Japan). \"Are you ready?\"\n\nThen he turned to the hare:\n\n\"Long-ears! Long-ears! are you ready?\"\n\nBoth the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal. When he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other, crying \"Yoisho, yoisho!\"\n\nWhile the monkey and the hare wrestled, the deer called out encouragingly or shouted warnings to each of them as the hare or the monkey pushed each other near the edge of the platform and were in danger of falling over.\n\n\"Red-back! Red-back! stand your ground!\" called out the deer.\n\n\"Long-ears! Long-ears! be strong, be strong--don't let the monkey beat you!\" grunted the bear.\n\nSo the monkey and the hare, encouraged by their friends, tried their very hardest to beat each other. The hare at last gained on the monkey. The monkey seemed to trip up, and the hare giving him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound.\n\nThe poor monkey sat up rubbing his back, and his face was very long as he screamed angrily. \"Oh, oh! how my back hurts--my back hurts me!\"\n\nSeeing the monkey in this plight on the ground, the deer holding his leaf on high said:\n\n\"This round is finished--the hare has won.\"\n\nKintaro then opened his luncheon box and taking out a rice-dumpling, gave it to the hare saying:\n\n\"Here is your prize, and you have earned, it well!\"\n\nNow the monkey got up looking very cross, and as they say in Japan \"his stomach stood up,\" for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten. So he said to Kintaro and the others who were standing by:\n\n\"I have not been fairly beaten. My foot slipped and I tumbled. Please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round.\"\n\nThen Kintaro consenting, the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again. Now, as every one knows, the monkey is a cunning animal by nature, and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible. To do this, he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare's long ear. This he soon managed to do. The hare was quite thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard, and the monkey seizing his opportunity at last, caught hold of one of the hare's legs and sent him sprawling in the middle of the dais. The monkey was now the victor and received, a rice-dumpling from Kintaro, which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back.\n\nThe deer now came up and asked the hare if he felt ready for another round, and if so whether he would try a round with him, and the hare consenting, they both stood up to wrestle. The bear came forward as umpire.\n\nThe deer with long horns and the hare with long ears, it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match. Suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees, and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten. In this way, sometimes the one, sometimes the other, conquering, the little party amused themselves till they were tired.\n\nAt last Kintaro got up and said:\n\n\"This is enough for to-day. What a nice place we have found for wrestling; let us come again to-morrow. Now, we will all go home. Come along!\" So saying, Kintaro led the way while the animals followed.\n\nAfter walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley. Kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing. Bridge there was none. The river rushed \"don, don\" on its way. All the animals looked serious, wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening.\n\nKintaro, however, said:\n\n\"Wait a moment. I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes.\"\n\nThe bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now.\n\nKintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank. At last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water's edge. He took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might, once, twice, thrice! At the third pull, so great was Kintaro's strength that the roots gave way, and \"meri, meri\" (crash, crash), over fell the tree, forming an excellent bridge across the stream.\n\n\"There,\" said Kintaro, \"what do you think of my bridge? It is quite safe, so follow me,\" and he stepped across first. The four animals followed. Never had they seen any one so strong before, and they all exclaimed:\n\n\"How strong he is! how strong he is!\"\n\nWhile all this was going on by the river a woodcutter, who happened to be standing on a rock overlooking the stream, had seen all that passed beneath him. He watched with great surprise Kintaro and his animal companions. He rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge.\n\nThe woodcutter, for such he seemed to be by his dress, marveled at all he saw, and said to himself:\n\n\"This is no ordinary child. Whose son can he be? I will find out before this day is done.\"\n\nHe hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them. Kintaro knew nothing of all this, and little guessed that he was being followed. On reaching the other side of the river he and the animals separated, they to their lairs in the woods and he to his mother, who was waiting for him.\n\nAs soon as he entered the cottage, which stood like a matchbox in the heart of the pine-woods, he went to greet his mother, saying:\n\n\"Okkasan (mother), here I am!\"\n\n\"O, Kimbo!\" said his mother with a bright smile, glad to see her boy home safe after the long day. \"How late you are to-day. I feared that something had happened to you. Where have you been all the time?\"\n\n\"I took my four friends, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, up into the hills, and there I made them try a wrestling match, to see which was the strongest. We all enjoyed the sport, and are going to the same place to-morrow to have another match.\"\n\n\"Now tell me who is the strongest of all?\" asked his mother, pretending not to know.\n\n\"Oh, mother,\" said Kintaro, \"don't you know that I am the strongest? There was no need for me to wrestle with any of them.\"\n\n\"But next to you then, who is the strongest?\"\n\n\"The bear comes next to me in strength,\" answered Kintaro.\n\n\"And after the bear?\" asked his mother again.\n\n\"Next to the bear it is not easy to say which is the strongest, for the deer, the monkey, and the hare all seem to be as strong as each other,\" said Kintaro.\n\nSuddenly Kintaro and his mother were startled by a voice from outside.\n\n\"Listen to me, little boy! Next time you go, take this old man with you to the wrestling match. He would like to join the sport too!\"\n\nIt was the old woodcutter who had followed Kintaro from the river. He slipped off his clogs and entered the cottage. Yama-uba and her son were both taken by surprise. They looked at the intruder wonderingly and saw that he was some one they had never seen before.\n\n\"Who are you?\" they both exclaimed.\n\nThen the woodcutter laughed and said:\n\n\"It does not matter who I am yet, but let us see who has the strongest arm--this boy or myself?\"\n\nThen Kintaro, who had lived all his life in the forest, answered the old man without any ceremony, saying:\n\n\"We will have a try if you wish it, but you must not be angry whoever is beaten.\"\n\nThen Kintaro and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other's hands. For a long time Kintaro and the old man wrestled together in this way, each trying to bend the other's arm, but the old man was very strong, and the strange pair were evenly matched. At last the old man desisted, declaring it a drawn game.\n\n\"You are, indeed, a very strong child. There are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm!\" said the woodcutter. \"I saw you first on the hanks of the river a few hours ago, when you pulled up that large tree to make a bridge across the torrent. Hardly able to believe what I saw I followed you home. Your strength of arm, which I have just tried, proves what I saw this afternoon. When you are full-grown you will surely be the strongest man in all Japan. It is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains.\"\n\nThen he turned to Kintaro's mother:\n\n\"And you, mother, have you no thought of taking your child to the Capital, and of teaching him to carry a sword as befits a samurai (a Japanese knight)?\"\n\n\"You are very kind to take so much interest in my son.\" replied the mother; \"but he is as you see, wild and uneducated, and I fear it would be very difficult to do as you say. Because of his great strength as an infant I hid him away in this unknown part of the country, for he hurt every one that came near him. I have often wished that I could, one day, see my boy a knight wearing two swords, but as we have no influential friend to introduce us at the Capital, I fear my hope will never come true.\"\n\n\"You need not trouble yourself about that. To tell you the truth I am no woodcutter! I am one of the great generals of Japan. My name is Sadamitsu, and I am a vassal of the powerful Lord Minamoto-no-Raiko. He ordered me to go round the country and look for boys who give promise of remarkable strength, so that they may be trained as soldiers for his army. I thought that I could best do this by assuming the disguise of a woodcutter. By good fortune, I have thus unexpectedly come across your son. Now if you really wish him to be a SAMURAI (a knight), I will take him and present him to the Lord Raiko as a candidate for his service. What do you say to this?\"\n\nAs the kind general gradually unfolded his plan the mother's heart was filled with a great joy. She saw that here was a wonderful chance of the one wish of her life being fulfilled--that of seeing Kintaro a SAMURAI before she died.\n\nBowing her head to the ground, she replied:\n\n\"I will then intrust my son to you if you really mean what you say.\"\n\nKintaro had all this time been sitting by his mother's side listening to what they said. When his mother finished speaking, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, joy! joy! I am to go with the general and one day I shall be a SAMURAI!\"\n\nThus Kintaro's fate was settled, and the general decided to start for the Capital at once, taking Kintaro with him. It need hardly be said that Yama-uba was sad at parting with her boy, for he was all that was left to her. But she hid her grief with a strong face, as they say in Japan. She knew that it was for her boy's good that he should leave her now, and she must not discourage him just as he was setting out. Kintaro promised never to forget her, and said that as soon as he was a knight wearing two swords he would build her a home and take care of her in her old age.\n\nAll the animals, those he had tamed to serve him, the bear, the deer, the monkey, and the hare, as soon as they found out that he was going away, came to ask if they might attend him as usual. When they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off.\n\n\"Kimbo,\" said his mother, \"mind and be a good boy.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kintaro,\" said the faithful animals, \"we wish you good health on your travels.\"\n\nThen they all climbed a tree to see the last of him, and from that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller, till he was lost to sight.\n\nThe general Sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as Kintaro.\n\nHaving arrived at their destination the general took Kintaro at once to his Lord, Minamoto-no-Raiko, and told him all about Kintaro and how he had found the child. Lord Raiko was delighted with the story, and having commanded Kintaro to be brought to him, made him one of his vassals at once.\n\nLord Raiko's army was famous for its band called \"The Four Braves.\" These warriors were chosen by himself from amongst the bravest and strongest of his soldiers, and the small and well-picked band was distinguished throughout the whole of Japan for the dauntless courage of its men.\n\nWhen Kintaro grew up to be a man his master made him the Chief of the Four Braves. He was by far the strongest of them all. Soon after this event, news was brought to the city that a cannibal monster had taken up his abode not far away and that people were stricken with fear. Lord Raiko ordered Kintaro to the rescue. He immediately started off, delighted at the prospect of trying his sword.\n\nSurprising the monster in its den, he made short work of cutting off its great head, which he carried back in triumph to his master.\n\nKintaro now rose to be the greatest hero of his country, and great was the power and honor and wealth that came to him. He now kept his promise and built a comfortable home for his old mother, who lived happily with him in the Capital to the end of her days.\n\nIs not this the story of a great hero?"

      "body": "The Tale Of Tsar Saltan:\n\nLong ago in a faraway kingdom, three sisters were outside in the courtyard talking, imagining what they would do if they were married to Tsar Saltan. One said that she would prepare a great feast for the entire world. The next said that she would weave linen for the entire world. The third said that she would give the tsar \"an heir, handsome and brave beyond compare.\"\n\nIt so happened that the tsar, who was just outside the fence, overheard the conversation. When he heard the words of the last maiden, he fell in love and asked her to be his wife. They were married that very same night and conceived a son soon after. The other sisters were given jobs as a cook and a weaver.\n\nA few months later the tsar went to war and had to part with his beloved wife. While he was at war his wife, the queen, gave birth to his son. A rider was sent to the tsar to convey the good news. However, the two sisters and a friend named Barbarika were so jealous of their sister's luck that they kidnapped the rider and replaced him with their own messenger who carried a note to the tsar which read: \"your wife, the queen, has borne neither a son nor daughter, neither a mouse nor a frog, but had given birth to an unknown little creature.\"\n\nWhen he read this message, the tsar was mortified and sent a letter back telling his wife to wait for his return before taking any action. The scheming sisters met the rider on the way back, got him drunk, and replaced the tsar's actual letter with a fake one that ordered the queen and her baby to be put into a barrel and thrown into the sea.\n\nOf course, there was no way to disobey an order from the tsar, so the palace guards put the queen and her son into the barrel and rolled it into the water. As the queen wept inside the barrel, her son grew stronger, not by the day, but by the minute. He begged the waves to wash them onto dry land. The waves obeyed and he and his mother found themselves washed ashore on a deserted island.\n\nBy now they were quite hungry, so the son made himself a bow and arrow, using small branches from a tree, and went hunting. Near the sea, he heard a screech and saw a poor swan struggling against a huge black hawk. Just as the hawk was about to bury its beak in the swan's neck, the youth shot an arrow, killing the hawk and spilling the bird's blood into the sea. The white swan swam up to the lad, thanked him and said, \"you didn't kill a hawk at all, but a wicked wizard. For saving my life, I will serve you forever.\"\n\nThe son returned to his mother and told her of his adventure, and then they both fell soundly asleep, even though they were still hungry and thirsty. The next morning they awoke and saw a wondrous city standing before them where there had been nothing before! The two marveled at the golden domes of the monasteries and churches behind the city's white walls. \"My, look at all the swan has done!\" the lad thought. The two walked into the city and throngs of people greeted them and crowned the young man a prince, proclaiming him Prince Gvidon.\n\nOne day a merchant ship was sailing near the island when its sailors caught a glimpse of the amazing walled city. The city's cannons signaled the ship to come ashore. Prince Gvidon welcomed them and offered them food and drink. He asked what they had for sale and where they were going. \"Our trade is in furs\", they said, \"and we are headed past the island of Buyan to the kingdom of Tsar Saltan.\"\n\nGvidon asked the merchant sailors to convey his respects to the tsar, even though his mother had earlier told him about the note that led to their expulsion from the tsar's kingdom. Still, Prince Gvidon thought the best of people and could never quite believe that his father could do such a thing.\n\nAs the merchant sailors were preparing to leave the island, the prince became sad when thinking about his father. \"What is wrong? Why are you so gloomy,\" the swan said. \"I so wish to see my father, the tsar\", Gvidon replied. Then, with a splash of water, the swan turned the prince into a small gnat so that he could hide himself in a crack of the mast of the ship en route to see the tsar.\n\nWhen the ship arrived at the Tsar Saltan's kingdom, the tsar greeted the merchant sailors and asked them to tell of the lands they had seen. The sailors told the tsar about the island and the walled city, and spoke of the hospitable Prince Gvidon. The tsar did not know that this Prince Gvidon was his son, but expressed a wish to see this beautiful city anyway. The two sisters and the old Barbarika did not want to let him go, however, and acted as if there were nothing to marvel at in the sailors' tale. \"What is really amazing,\" they said, \"is a squirrel that sits under a fir tree, cracking golden nuts containing kernels of pure emerald, and singing a song. That's something which is truly extraordinary!\"\n\nHearing this, the gnat, really Prince Gvidon, got angry and stung the old woman's right eye. After he flew back to the island, Gvidon told the swan the story he heard about the remarkable squirrel. Then the prince walked into his courtyard and, lo and behold, there was the singing squirrel, sitting under a fir tree, cracking golden nuts! The prince rejoiced at this and ordered that a crystal house be built for the little animal. He placed a guard there to stand watch and ordered a scribe to record every shell. Profit for the prince, honor for the squirrel!\n\nSome time later, a second ship came to the island enroute to the tsar and the prince again told the swan that he wished to see his father again. This time, the swan turned the prince into a fly so that he could hide in a crack of the ship.\n\nAfter the vessel arrived in the kingdom, the sailors told Tsar Saltan about the wondrous squirrel they had seen. Saltan again wanted to visit this fabled city but was talked out of it when the two sisters and Barbarika ridiculed the sailors' story and spoke themselves of a greater wonder--of thirty-three handsome young knights, led by old Chernomor, rising from out of the raging sea. The fly, Gvidon, became quite angry with the women and stung Barbarika's left eye before flying back to the island.\n\nOnce home again, he told the swan about old Chernomor and the thirty-three knights, and lamented that he had never seen such a wonder. \"These knights are from the great waters that I know,\" the swan said. \"Don't be sad, for these knights are my brothers and they will come to you.\"\n\nLater, the prince went back and climbed a tower of his palace and gazed at the sea. Suddenly, a giant wave rose high and deep onto the shore, and when it receded, thirty-three knights in armor, led by old Chernomor, emerged, ready to serve Prince Gvidon. They promised that they would come out of the sea each day to protect the city.\n\nA few months later, a third ship came to the island. In his customary fashion, the prince again made the sailors feel welcome and told them to send his respects to the tsar. As the sailors prepared themselves for their journey, the prince told the swan that he still couldn't get his father out of his mind and wished to see him again. This time the swan turned the prince into a bumblebee.\n\nThe ship arrived in the kingdom and the sailors told Tsar Saltan about the wondrous city they had seen and how every day thirty-three knights and old Chernomor would emerge from the sea to protect the island.\n\nThe tsar marveled at this and wanted to see this extraordinary land, but once again was talked out of it by the two sisters and old Barbarika. They belittled the sailors' tale and said that what was really amazing was that beyond the seas lived a princess so stunning that you couldn't take your eyes off of her. \"The light of day pales against her beauty, the darkness of night is lit up by it. When she speaks it is like the murmur of a tranquil brook. Now that's a marvel!\" they said. Gvidon, the bumblebee, got angry at the women once more and stung Barbarika on her nose. They tried to catch him, but to no avail. He was safely on his journey back home.\n\nAfter his arrival there, Gvidon strolled out to the seashore until he was met by the white swan. \"Why so gloomy this time?\" the swan asked. Gvidon said that he was sad because he did not have a wife. He related the tale he had heard of the beautiful princess whose beauty lit up the darkness, whose words flowed like a murmuring brook. The swan was silent for awhile, then said that there was such a princess. \"But a wife,\" the swan continued, \"is no glove that one can simply cast from one's hand.\" Gvidon said he understood but that he was prepared to walk the rest of his life and to all corners of the world to search for the wondrous princess. At this, the swan sighed and said:\n\nThere's no need to travel, \nThere's no need to tire. \nThe woman that you desire, \nIs now yours to spy. \nThe princess is I.\n\nWith this, she flapped her wings and turned into the beautiful woman that the prince had heard about. The two passionately embraced and kissed, and Gvidon took her to meet his mother. The prince and the beautiful maiden were married that very same evening.\n\nA short time later, another ship came to the island. As usual, Prince Gvidon welcomed the sailors and, as they were leaving, he asked the sailors to send his greetings to the tsar and to extend an invitation to him to visit. Being happy with his new bride, Gvidon decided not to leave the island this time.\n\nWhen the ship arrived at the kingdom of Tsar Sultan, the sailors again told the tsar of the fantastic island they had seen, of the singing squirrel cracking the golden nuts, of the thirty-three armored knights rising out of the sea, and of the lovely princess whose beauty was beyond compare.\n\nThis time the tsar would not listen to the snide remarks of the sisters and Barbarika. He called his fleet and set sail for the island immediately.\n\nWhen he reached the island, Prince Gvidon was there to meet the tsar. Saying nothing, Gvidon led him, along with his two sisters-in-law and Barbarika, to the palace. Along the way, the tsar saw everything that he had heard so much about. There at the gates were the thirty-three knights and old Chernomor standing guard. There in the courtyard was the remarkable squirrel, singing a song and gnawing on a golden nut. There in the garden was the beautiful princess, Gvidon's wife. And then the tsar saw something unexpected: there standing next to the princess was Gvidon's mother, the tsar's long-lost wife. The tsar recognized her immediately. With tears streaming down his cheeks, he rushed to embrace her, and years of heartache were now forgotten. He then realized that Prince Gvidon was his son, and the two threw their arms around each other as well.\n\nA merry feast was held. The two sisters and Barbarika hid in shame, but eventually they were found. They burst into tears, confessing everything. But the tsar was so happy that he let them all go. The tsar and the queen and Prince Gvidon and the princess lived the rest of their days in happiness."

      "body": "The Flying Trunk:\n\nThe merchant's son flying in the trunk\n\nThere was once a merchant who was very successful. He saved and invested wisely and became enormously rich.\n\nHis son inherited his wealth and lived a merry life with it. He went to parties every night, made kites out of five-pound notes, and when by the side of a lake, he would not skim stones, but gold coins instead.\n\nThis way he soon lost all his money. At last he had nothing left but a pair of slippers, an old dressing gown, and four shillings. And now all his so-called friends left him. They would not walk with him in the streets, but one of them, who was very good-natured, sent him an old trunk with this message, “Pack up!”\n\n“Yes,” he said, “it is all very well to say ‘pack up.'” But he had nothing left to pack, therefore he sat himself in the trunk.\n\nIt was a very wonderful trunk, for no sooner did you press on the lock than the trunk could fly. He shut the lid and pressed the lock, when away flew the trunk up the chimney, with him in it, right up into the clouds. Whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked he was frightened, for if the trunk had collapsed, he would have fallen down into the trees. However, he arrived safely in Turkey. He hid the trunk in a wood under some dry leaves and then went into the town. This he could do very well, as Turkish clothes is quite similar to what he was wearing.\n\nHe happened to meet a nurse with a little child. “I say, Turkish nurse,” he cried, “what castle is that near the town, with the windows placed so high?”\n\n“The Sultan’s daughter lives there,” she replied. “It has been foretold that she will be very unhappy about a lover and therefore no one is allowed to visit her unless the king and queen are present.”\n\n“Thank you,” said the merchant’s son. So he went back to the wood, seated himself in his trunk, flew up to the roof of the castle, and crept through the window into the room where the princess lay asleep on the sofa. She awoke and was very much frightened, but he told her he was a Turkish angel who had come down through the air to see her. This pleased her very much. He sat down by her side and talked to her, telling her that her eyes were like beautiful dark lakes, in which the thoughts swam about like little mermaids and that her forehead was a snowy mountain which contained wonderful halls full of pictures. He told to her the story about the stork, who brings the beautiful babies from the rivers. These stories delighted the princess and when he asked her if she would marry him, she immediately agreed.\n\nMechant's son agrees to tell a story to the king and queen\n\n“But you must come on Saturday,” she said, “for then my parents will take tea with me. They will be very proud when they find that I am going to marry a Turkish angel. But you must think of some very pretty stories to tell them, for they like to hear stories better than anything. My mother prefers one that teaches a lesson, but my father likes something funny, to make him laugh.”\n\n“Very well,” he replied, “I shall bring you nothing else but a story” and so they parted. But the princess gave him a sword studded with gold coins, and these he could make useful.\n\nHe flew away to the town and bought a new dressing gown, and afterwards returned to the wood, where he made up a story so as to be ready by Saturday, which was not easy. It was ready, however, when he went to see the princess on Saturday. The king and queen and the whole court were at tea with the princess, and he was received with great politeness.\n\n“Will you tell us a story?” said the queen, “one that is instructive and full of learning.”\n\n“Yes, but with something in it to laugh at,” said the king.\n\n“Certainly,” he replied, and started at once, asking them to listen closely.\n\n“There was once a bundle of matches that were very proud of where they came from. The great pine tree from which they had been cut was once a large old tree in the wood. The matches now lay between a tinder box and an old iron saucepan and were talking about their younger days. ‘Ah! then we grew on the green branches,’ said they, ‘and every morning and evening we were fed with drops of dew. Whenever the sun shone we felt its warm rays, and the little birds would tell stories to us in their songs. We knew that we were rich, for the other trees only wore their green dresses in summer, while our family were able to dress themselves in green all summer and winter. But the woodcutter came and chopped us down. Our father, the trunk was made into a very fine ship’s mast and can sail around the world whenever he will. Other branches of the family were taken to different places, and our own job now is to provide lights for ordinary people. This is how such noble people as us came to be in a kitchen.’\n\n“‘Mine has been a very different fate,’ said the iron pot, which stood by the matches. ‘Since I first came into the world, I have been used to cooking and scouring. I am the first in this house when anything solid or useful is required. My only pleasure is to be made clean and shining after dinner and to sit in my place and have a little chat with my neighbors. All of us except the water bucket, which is sometimes taken into the courtyard, live here together within these four walls. We get our news from the market basket, but it sometimes tells us very unpleasant things about the people things happening. Yes, and one day an old pot was so shocked by the news that it fell down and was broken in pieces.’\n\n“‘You are talking too much about bad things!’ said the tinder box. Now a tinder box is used to make sparks to light a fire by striking its steel against flint and this tinder box got so annoyed with the pot’s story, it started to send sparks flying, crying, ‘We want an enjoyable evening, don’t we?’\n\n“‘Yes, of course,’ said the matches. ‘Let us talk about those who comes from the best family background.’\n\n“‘No, I don’t like to be always talking of what we are,’ said the saucepan. ‘Let us think of some other fun. I will begin. We will tell something that has happened to ourselves, that will be very easy, and interesting as well. On the Baltic Sea, near the Danish shore—’\n\n“‘What a pretty beginning!’ said the plates. ‘We will all like that story, I am sure.’\n\n“‘Yes. Well, in my youth I lived in a quiet family where the furniture was polished, the floors scrubbed and clean curtains put up, every two weeks.’\n\n“‘What an interesting way you have of telling a story,’ said the carpet broom. ‘It is easy to see that you are a great story-teller, something so pure runs through what you say.’\n\n“‘That is quite true,’ said the water bucket; and it made a jump with joy and splashed some water on the floor.\n\n“Then the saucepan went on with its story and the end was as good as the beginning.\n\n“The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet broom brought some old green leaf from the floor and put it on top of the saucepan, like putting on a crown. It knew this would annoy the others, but it thought, ‘If I crown him today, he might crown me tomorrow.’\n\n“‘Now let us have a dance,’ said the fire tongs. Then how they danced and stuck one leg in the air! The chair cushion in the corner burst with laughter at the sight.\n\n“‘Shall I be crowned now?’ asked the fire tongs. So the broom found another leaf for the tongs.\n\n“‘They are only very ordinary people after all,’ thought the matches. The tea urn was now asked to sing, but she said she had a cold and could not sing unless she felt boiling heat within. They all thought this was strange. They also considered it strange that she did not wish to sing except in the parlor, when on the table with the grand people.\n\n“In the window sat an old ink pen, which the maid usually used to write. There was nothing great about the pen, except that it had been dipped too deeply in the ink, but it was proud of that.\n\n“‘If the tea urn won’t sing,’ said the pen, ‘she needn’t. There’s a nightingale in a cage outside, that can sing. She has not been taught much, certainly, but we need not say anything this evening about that.’\n\n“‘I think it’s not right,’ said the teakettle, who was kitchen singer and half brother to the tea urn, ‘that a rich foreign bird should be listened to here. Let the basket decide what is right.’\n\n“‘I certainly am annoyed,’ said the basket, annoyed inside, more than any one can imagine. Are we spending the evening properly? Would it not be more sensible to tidy the house? If everyone was in his own place, I would start a game. This would be quite something.’\n\n“‘Let us act a play,’ they all said. At the same moment the door opened and the maid came in. Then nobody moved, they remained quite still, although they were all somewhat big-headed.\n\n“‘Yes, if we had decided,’ each of them thought, ‘we might have has a nice evening.’\n\n“The maid took the matches and lit them, and dear me, how they spluttered and blazed up!\n\n“‘Now then,’ thought each match, ‘every one will see that we are the best. How we shine! What a light we give!’ But even while they spoke their lights went out.”\n\n“What a great story!” said the queen. “I feel as if I were really in the kitchen and could see the matches. Yes, you shall marry our daughter.”\n\n“Certainly,” said the king, “you shall have our daughter.” The wedding day was fixed, and on the evening before, the whole city was lit up. Cakes and other treats were thrown among the people. The street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted “Harrah!” and whistled between their fingers. Altogether it was a very splendid affair.\n\n“I will give them another treat,” said the merchant’s son. So he went and bought rockets and crackers and every kind of fireworks that could be thought of, packed them in his trunk, and flew up with it into the air. What a whizzing and popping they made as they went off! The Turks, when they saw the sight, jumped so high that their slippers flew about their ears. It was easy to believe after this that the princess was really going to marry a Turkish angel.\n\nAs soon as the merchant’s son had come down to the wood after the fireworks, he thought, “I will go back into the town now and hear what they think of the entertainment.” It was quite understandable that he would want to know. And what strange things people did say, to be sure! Every one whom he questioned had a different tale to tell, though they all thought it very beautiful.\n\n“I saw the Turkish angel myself,” said one. “He had eyes like glittering stars and a head like foaming water.”\n\n“He flew in a cloak of fire,” said another, “and lovely little baby angels peeped out it.”\n\nHe heard many more fine things about himself and that the next day he was to be married. After this he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk. It had disappeared! A spark from the fireworks which remained had set it on fire. It was burned to ashes. So the merchant’s son could not fly any more, nor go to meet his bride. She stood all day on the roof, waiting for him, and most likely she is waiting there still, while he wanders through the world telling fairy tales—but none of them so amusing as the one he told about the matches."
