All the servants should be present here again tomorrow with their sticks.\n\nAll the servants went to their homes and gathered again at the same place the next day.

      "body": "Once a fox was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell into a well. He tried his level best to come out but all in vain. So, he had no other alternative but to remain there till the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked “what are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”\n\nThe sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and see for yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.\n\nThen the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then I shall help you come out too.” The goat was innocent enough to understand the shrewdness of the fox and did as the fox said and helped him get out of the well.\n\nWhile walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have got in without seeing how to get out.”\n\nMoral: Look before you leap. Do not just blindly walk in to anything without thinking.\n\n"

      "body": "Sri Krishna Devaraya was the emperor of Vizayanagra. He had eight advisors. Tenali Rama was one among them. He was very clever and spontaneous. Sri Krishna Devaraya had some special kind of brinjal plants in his garden. The brinjal was very rare kind and curry made out of it was very tasty which was loved by the emperor. As it was a rare kind, thegarden was very guarded and no one was allowed to view the plants without the emperor’s permission.\n\nOnce the emperor had arranged dinner for his advisors and the brinjal curry was served. Tenali Rama had enjoyed the brinjal curry very much and went home. But he was unable to forget the taste. He told his wife about the taste of curry. Tenali Rama’s wife also liked brinjal curry, she asked Tenali Rama to bring few brinjals so that she can prepare a curry. But Tenali Rama knew that the emperor was taking extreme care about the Brinjal plants and he can easily detect a missing of even one brinjal from his garden. And, theemperor will punish such thief if caught stealing a brinjal from his garden.\n\nBut Tenali’s wife pleaded him to bring a brinjal from the garden without telling anybody. Tenali Rama had no choice other than stealing a brinjal from the emperor’s garden. One night he went to the garden, jumped the wall and plucked few brinjals from the garden. By the god’s grace, no one had seen him. His wife cooked the brinjals and the curry was very tasty. Like all the mothers, she too loved her son very much and wanted to serve a brinjal curry him. But Tenali Rama asked her not to do such thing because if their son reveals to anybody that he had a rare brinjal curry,then they may get caught and get punished for stealing a brinjal from the garden.\n\nBut his wife did not agree. She wanted to serve the curry to her son. She was unable to eat the curry alone without serving her little kid who was sleeping after doing his homework on the roof of their house. She asked Tenali Rama to find a way so that their son can also taste the brinjal curry. Tenali Rama also loved his son, so he thought of an idea and with a lot of hesitation went on to the roof to wake up his child with a bucket of water and poured the water on the child. When the child woke up he said “It is raining. Let’s go inside the house and have a dinner”. After going inside the room he changed the clothes of his son and gave him the rice and brinjal curry for the dinner. Tenali Rama told his wife loudly that “it was raining outside, and let the boy sleep in the room”.\n\nAnd the next day, the emperor came to know that few brinjals were missing in his garden. The Gardener who kept the count of each vegetable and flower found that the three brinjals were missing. It became a challenging issue for the emperor and took it very seriously. He declared a reward for the person who can catch the thief. Chief advisor Appaji suspected that only Tenali Rama was capable of doing such things. And they told the emperor about it. The emperor sent his courtiers and asked Tenali Rama to come immediately. Once Tenali Rama came he asked him about the missing brinjals. Then Tenali Rama told, “I was not aware of the missing brinjals”. Then the chief advisor told “Tenali Rama was lying. Let’s enquire his son”.\n\nThe king sent his courtiers to bring Tenali Rama’s son. Once his son came, He was asked what vegetable he had in the dinner last night. The child replied, “The brinjal curry and it was very tasty”. Then the advisor told Tenali Rama that He needs to accept his crime. But Tenali Rama said his son had slept very early and he might be saying something which he got in his dream.\n\nSo the emperor asked the little kid that “can you please explain clearly what had you done yesterday after coming from the school?”\n\nTenali Rama’s son replied that“yesterday after coming from the school, I played for some time and after that, I went on to the roof, did my homework, and slept on the roof. But when the rain started, my father came and woke me up. By that time my dress was fully wet, then we went inside, had the dinner and slept again”.\n\nThe chief advisor Appaji was shocked because there was no rain at all yesterday. And the atmosphere was fully dry. So they thought the kid had a dream and freed Tenali Rama without any punishment. However, later Tenali Raman told the truth to the emperor and was pardoned by the emperor for his clever witty idea.\n\nMoral: To start with – Stealing is not a good thing! You can always use your brain and ease out of the difficult situations.\n\n"

Now this courtier always wanted to be chief minister, but this was not possible as Birbal filled that position. One day Akbar praised Birbal in front of the courtier. This made the courtier very angry and he said that the king praised Birbal unjustly and if Birbal could answer three of his questions, he would accept the fact that Birbal was intelligent. Akbar always wanting to test Birbals wit readily agreed.\nThe three questions were\n1. How many stars are there in the sky\n2. Where is the centre of the Earth and\n3. How many men and how many women are there in the world.\n\nImmediately Akbar asked Birbal the three questions and informed him that if he could not answer them, he would\nhave to resign as chief minister.\n\nTo answer the first question, Birbal brought a hairy sheep and said, “There are as many stars in the sky as there is hair on the sheep’s body. My friend the courtier is welcome to count them if he likes.”\n\nTo answer the second question, Birbal drew a couple of lines on the floor and bore an iron rod in it and said, “this is the center of the Earth, the courtier may measure it himself if he has any doubts.”\n\nIn answer to the third question, Birbal said, “Counting the exact number of men and women in the world would be a problem as there are some specimens like our courtier friend here who cannot easily be classified as either.\n\nTherefore if all people like him are killed, then and only then can one count the exact number.”\n\nMoral: There is Always a Way.\n\n"

      "body": "As we all know, Birbal was not only Emperor Akbar’s favorite minister but also a minister dearly loved by most of the commoners, because of his ready wit and wisdom. People used to come to him from far and wide for advise on personal matters too. However, there was a group of ministers that were jealous of his growing popularity and disliked him intensely.They outwardly showered him with praise and compliments, but on the inside they began to hatch a plot to kill him.\n\nOne day they approached the king’s barber with a plan. As the barber was extremely close to the king, they asked him to help them get rid of Birbal permanently. And of course, they promised him a huge sum of money in return. The wicked barber readily agreed.\n\nThe next time the king required his services, the barber started a conversation about the emperor’s father who he also used to serve. He sang praises of his fine, silky-smooth hair. And then as an afterthought he asked the king that as he was enjoying such great prosperity, had he made an attempt to do anything for the welfare of his ancestors?\n\nThe king was furious at such impertinent stupidity and told the barber that it was not possible to do anything because they were already dead. The barber mentioned that he knew of a magician who could come of help. The magician could send a person up to heaven to enquire about his father’s welfare. But of course this person would have to be chosen carefully; he would have to be intelligent enough to follow the magicians instructions as well as make on-the-spot decisions. He must be wise, intelligent and responsible. The barber then suggested the best person for the job – the wisest of all ministers, Birbal.\n\nThe king was very excited about hearing from his dead father and asked the barber to go ahead and make the arrangements immediately. He asked him what was needed to be done. The barber explained that they would take Birbal in a procession to the burial grounds and light a pyre. The magician would then chant some ‘mantras’ as Birbal would ascend to the heavens through the smoke. The chanting would help protect Birbal from the fire.\n\nThe king happily informed Birbal of this plan. Birbal said that he thought it a brilliant idea and wanted to know the brain behind it. When learning that it was the barber’s idea, he agreed to go to heaven on condition that he be given a large some of money for the long journey as well as one month’s time to settle his family so that they had no trouble while he was gone. The king agreed to both conditions.\n\nIn the duration of this month, he got a few trustworthy men to build a tunnel from the funeral grounds to his house. And on the day of the ascension, after the pyre had been lit, Birbal escaped through the concealed door of the tunnel. He disappeared in to his house where he hid for a few months while his hair and beard grew long and unruly.\n\nIn the meantime his enemies were rejoicing as they thought that they had seen the last of Birbal. Then one day after many, many months Birbal arrived at the palace with news of the king’s father. The king was extremely pleased to see him and ready with a barrage of questions. Birbal told the king that his father was in the best of spirits and had been provided with all the comforts except one.\n\nThe king wanted to know what was lacking because now he thought he had found a way to send things and people to heaven. Birbal answered that there were no barbers in heaven, which is why even he was forced to grow his own beard. He said that his father had asked for a good barber.\n\nSo the king decided to send his own barber to serve his father in heaven. He called both the barber and the magician to prepare to send him to heaven. The barber could say absolutely nothing in his own defense as he was caught in his own trap. And once the pyre was lit he died on the spot. Nobody dared to conspire against Birbal again.\n\n"

So all the doves landed and began to eat.\n\nSuddenly a net fell over them and they were all trapped. They saw a hunter approaching carrying a huge club. The doves desperately fluttered their wings trying to get out, but to no avail. The king had an idea. He advised all the doves to fly up together carrying the net with them. He said that there was strength in unity.\n\nEach dove picked up a portion of the net and together they flew off carrying the net with them. The hunter looked up in astonishment. He tried to follow them, but they were flying high over hills and valleys. They flew to a hill near a city of temples where there lived a mouse who could help them. He was a faithful friend of the dove king.\n\nWhen the mouse heard the loud noise of their approach, he went into hiding. The dove king gently called out to him and then the mouse was happy to see him. The dove king explained that they had been caught in a trap and needed the mouse’s help to gnaw at the net with his teeth and set them free.\n\nThe mouse agreed saying that he would set the king free first. The king insisted that he first free his subjects and the king last. The mouse understood the king’s feelings and complied with his wishes. He began to cut the net and one by one all the doves were freed including the dove king.\n\nThey all thanked the mouse and flew away together, united in their strength.\n\nMoral: When you work together, you are stronger.\n\n"

He was a very hard working and loyal watchman.\n\nOne day, a colony watchman was making his rounds. Suddenly, he noticed something brown and shiny under a tree. Moving closer, he saw that it was a pair of boots, quite new. “Now, who could left these here?” the watchman wondered. But there was nobody around to ask.\n\nIt was afternoon and everyone was indoors. So, the watchman took the pair of boots to the nearest police station. “You may leave them here!” said Mr. Smith, the policeman, pointing to the floor. He was busy writing reports and did not look at the boots carefully.\n\nAfter some time, Mr. Smith put his pen down and decided to have his lunch. He had taken off his boots because it was very hot that day. As he bent down to wear his boots, he found two pairs lying side by side. “Oh! Which one is mine? They both look alike!” Mr. Smoth thought. It did not matter which pair of boots the policeman put on because they were of the same size. He put his feet into the boots on the left.\n\nFrom that moment onwards, strange things began to happen to him. As Mr. Smith opened his lunch box, he gazed out of the window and sighed, “Ah! How lucky those birds are, flying wherever they please! How I wish, I were a little sparrow!” As soon as he said these words, the policeman found himself changed into a bird- a sparrow. “Oh, I must be dreaming!” he thought.\nHe flew out of the window, on the grass and began to look for worms- quite a different lunch from his lunch. But the very next moment, he was surrounded by darkness. A naughty boy had flung his cap over him. The boy caught him and held him tightly. “You naughty boy! Let me go! I am a policeman,” shouted Mr. Smith. But because he was now a bird, the only sound the boy heard was, “Tweet, tweet!” The boy sold the sparrow to another boy who carried him home to his mother.\n\n“What a waste of money!” the boy’s mother said. “This is only a sparrow, a very common bird. Anyway, you may keep it for a day in that empty cage near the window. At least, Polly will be happy.” Polly was a large parrot kept in a big cage. The only words she knew were, “Now, let us be men!” This she kept saying all day long.\n\nNext to Polly’s cage was another bird’s cage, a canary’s. When she saw how unhappy the sparrow was, she said in bird language, “Fly away! Quick!” The naughty boy has forgotten to lock your cage. “The window is open! Fly away! Fly away!” The sparrow quickly flew away straight to the police station. “But how was he to become Mr. Smith, the policeman again?” he thought.\n\nThen the sparrow remembered Polly’s words and said them aloud, “Now, let us be men!” All at once, the sparrow became Mr. Smith again, sitting in his chair at the police station. The first thing he did was that he quickly took off the wrong boots, locked them in a cupboard and more his old boots again!"

I was not married at that time: I was seeing this guy(my husband now) for quite a few years and we decided to marry. Before marriage, my family is a lower middle class one , We all are attached and share a close bond amongst all the family members. \n\nI wanted to help my father ever since I was graduated and hence I took small jobs to take care of my fees and other expenses. My father was very proud of me as I got a job in one of the MNC’s and since then I have been taking care of my younger brothers and their needs.With my job, me and this guy(my husband now)have started a small office as we want to do something in life on his own: With our regular jobs, we were investing time and effort on our new office which was doing quite fine by then. My family was more important to me .. and I want to show all the luxuries to my parents and younger brother who always had adjusted with the little pocket money and little comforts my father provided them…yet we were so happy together. \n\nOnce I got a job, I wanted to change everything…I wanted to buy everything that they deserve , at their age .. Im happy that yes I could do everything I thought .. gifting them everything they need at the proper time… and sometimes their friends envy being my brothers and ask me sometimes to adopt them as my brothers….I felt proud too… Two of my brothers are humble and caring towards me.\n\n I share a motherly bond with my younger one as he is too younger .. and I was his teacher from his school days….On his birthday, I wanted to gift him a bike as he used to travel by bus to his college….I had half of the amount ready to be paid as initial amount and the remaining amount I want to take two wheeler loan …Hence I gave my other brother the amount and ask to book the vehicle and to get the vehicle ready to be delivered by his birthday… We both invested 10 days to get him his favorite bike,,, searching for the agents who could deliver on the special day and to get the amount gathered…. \n\nOn the day , my brother had to pay the initial amount, I got a news that someone has stolen the amount from the place they live and quite a few things have reported missing.. I lost all hopes, shocked.. at the same time angry .. seeing that I could not get him the best gift of his life…. I did not tell this guy( my husband now) all this cos I don’t want him to interfere, tell me not to spoil my brothers with gifts as such and blah blah…. On the day I lost money .. I was so depressed ….he asked me what happened why I was so low…. I burst out in tears and told him that I wanted to gift my brother a bike but could not do it as im having no money….i may accumulate it in the next 2 months.. but I want to do it now… \n\nHe took out the debit card and gave it to me and told me to fulfill my wish..and that is the company amount and I have to return as soon as I can cos we have to pay the salaries as well to the employees…. I thanked him and told him that I never believed that he will support me…\n\n He told me “ I did not do it for your brother, I did it for you… I cant see you cry.. not the debit card,I may have given anything at the moment which makes you happy”.. God.. how can I thank him… I did not even trust him…I returned the payment in the promised time Till now.. I continue giving my family whatever I can whatever I thought I should.. to make them lead a decent life….Thank you love .. for being with me. \n\nSorry I did not trust you.....

      "body": "Godfather's Picture Book:\n\nGodfather could tell stories, so many of them and such long ones, and he could cut out paper figures and draw pictures. When it was nearly Christmas he would bring out a scrapbook with clean white pages, and on these he pasted pictures cut out of books and newspapers; and if there weren't enough for the story he was going to tell, he drew them himself. When I was a little boy I got several of these picture books, but the prettiest of them all was the one from \"that memorable year when gas replaced the old oil lamps in Copenhagen\" - and that was the inscription written on the first page.\n\n\"We must take great care of this book,\" said Father and Mother, \"and only bring it out on important occasions.\"\n\nBut Godfather had written on the cover:\n\nIf you should tear the book, that's not a great wrong;\nOther little friends have done worse for ever so long.\nBest of all were the times when Godfather himself showed the book, read the verses and other writings in it, and told many things besides; then the story would become a very real one.\n\nOn the first page was a picture from \"The Flying Post,\" showing Copenhagen with its Round Tower and Our Lady's Church. On its left was pasted an old lantern, on which was written, \"Train oil,\" and on the right was a chandelier, with \"Gas\" written on it.\n\n\"See, that's the title page,\" said Godfather. \"That's the beginning of the story you're going to hear. It could also be given as an entire play, if one could perform it. Train Oil and Gas; or , The Life and Times of Copenhagen.That's a very good title! At the bottom of the page is still another little picture; it's quite hard to understand, so I'll explain it to you. That is a hell horse. He shouldn't have come until the end of the book, but he has run on ahead to say that neither the beginning, nor the middle, nor the end is any good; he could have done it much better - if he could have done it at all. The hell horse, you see, stands hitched all day in the newspaper, and walks on the columns, they say. But in the evening he slips out, stations himself outside the poet's door, and neighs, so that the man inside will instantly die; but he won't die if there's any real life in him.\n\nThe hell horse is usually a poor creature who can't understand himself and can't earn a living, and he gets his air and food by going around and neighing. I am certain that he doesn't like Godfather's picture book, but in spite of that, it may be worth at least the paper it's written on.\n\n\"Now that's the first page of the book; that's the title page.\n\n\"It was the very last evening on which the oil lamps were to be lighted; the town had gas, and it was so bright that the old street lamps seemed quite lost in it.\n\n\"I was in the street myself that evening,\" said Godfather. \"The people were walking about, looking at the old and the new lighting. There were a great many people and twice as many legs as heads. The watchmen stood around sadly, for they didn't know how soon they would be dismissed, like the oil lamps. They could remember so far back, but dared not think forward. They had so many memories of quiet evenings and dark nights. I leaned up against a lamppost,\" continued Godfather, \"and there was a great spluttering in the oil and the wick. I could hear what the lamp said, and you shall hear it, too.\n\n\" 'We've done the best we could,' said the lamp. 'We were good enough for our time, and have lighted up joy and sorrow; we have lived through many wonderful things; you might say we have been the night eyes of Copenhagen. Now let new lights take our place and take over our duties; but how many years they'll shine, and what they will light up, remain to be seen! Indeed, they shine a little stronger than we old fellows, but that's nothing; when you're molded like a gas chandelier, and have the connections they have, the one pours into the other. They have pipes going in all directions and can get strength from both inside the town and outside it. But each one of us oil lamps shines because of what he has in himself, and not because of any family connections. We and our ancestors have lighted Copenhagen from olden times, from immeasurably long ago. But since this is now the last evening that we'll stand and shine in the second row, so to speak, in the street here along with you, you shining comrades, we won't sulk or be envious. No, far from it; we'll be happy and good-natured. We are the old sentinels, being relieved by new guards in better uniforms than ours. We'll tell you what our family, way back to great-great-great-grandmother lantern, has seen and experienced - the whole history of Copenhagen. May you and your successors, right down to the last gas chandelier, experience and be able to relate such wonderful things as we can, when you get your discharge someday. And you'll get it!\n\nYou may be sure of that! People are certain to find a better light than gas. I've heard a student say that there's a possibility they may someday burn sea water!' When the lamp said these words, the wick spluttered, as if it had water in it already.\"\n\nGodfather had listened closely, thought it over, and decided it was an excellent idea of the old lantern, on this evening of the change from oil to gas, to tell and display the whole history of Copenhagen.\n\n\"You mustn't let a good idea slip,\" said Godfather. \"I took it at once, went home, and made this picture book for you. It goes even farther back in time than the lamps could go. Here's the book, and here's the story!\n\nCOPENHAGEN'S LIFE AND TIMES\n\n\"It begins in darkness, on a coal-black page - that's the Dark Ages.\n\n\"Now let's turn the page,\" said Godfather. \"Do you see the picture? Only the wild sea and the swelling northeast wind, driving heavy ice floes before it. There's no one out sailing on them, only great stone blocks, which rolled down onto the ice from the mountains of Norway. The north wind blows the ice away; he wants to show the German mountains what rocks are found up in the North. The ice floes are already down in the sound, off the coast of Zealand, where Copenhagen now stands; but there was no Copenhagen there then. There were great sandbanks under the water, and the ice floes with the big boulders struck against one of these. Then the whole ice field stuck so fast that the northeast wind couldn't move it again, and so he became as furious as could be and pronounced a curse on the sandbank, the 'Thieves' ground,' as he called it. He swore that if ever it should rise above the surface of the sea, thieves and robbers would live there, and the gallows and wheel be raised on it.\n\n\"But while he cursed and swore this way, the sun came out, and those bright and gentle spirits, the children of light, swayed an swung in its beams; they danced over the ice floes until they melted, and the great boulders sank to the sandy bottom of the sea.\n\n\" 'Sun scum!' said the northeast wind. 'Is that friendship and kinship? I'll remember and take revenge for that. Now I pronounce a curse!'\n\n\" 'We pronounce a blessing!' sang the children of light. 'The sandbank will rise, and we shall guard it. Truth, goodness, and beauty shall dwell there!'\n\n\" 'Stuff and nonsense!' said the northeast wind.\n\n\"You see, the lantern knew nothing of all this and therefore couldn't tell about it,\" said Godfather. \"But I know it, and it's very important to the life and times of Copenhagen.\n\n\"Now we'll turn the page,\" said Godfather. \"Years have passed, and the sandbank has lifted itself; a sea gull has settled on the biggest rock, which has jutted out of water. You can see it in the picture. Years and years have passed.\n\n\"The sea cast up dead fish onto the shore. Tough lyme grass sprang up, withered, rotted, and fertilized the soil; many different kinds of grasses and plants followed, until the bank became a green island. There the vikings landed, for there was level ground for fighting and good anchorage beside the island off the coast of Zealand.\n\n\"I think the first oil lamp was lit to cook fish over, and there were plenty of fishes here. The herring swam through the sound in great shoals; it was hard to force a boat through them. They glittered in the water as if there were lightning down there, and shone in the depths like the northern lights. The sound had a wealth of fishes; therefore houses were built on the coast of Zealand, with walls of oak and roofs of bark - there were trees enough for that purpose. Ships anchored in the harbor, oil lamps hanging from swaying ropes, and the northeast wind blew and sang, 'O-out!' If a lantern glimmered on the island it was a thieves' lantern, for smugglers and thieves plied their trade on Thieves' Island.\n\n\" 'I believe that all the evil I wished for is coming,' said the northeast wind. 'Soon the tree will come, from which I can shake the fruit.'\n\n\"And here is the tree,\" said Godfather. \"Do you see the gallows on Thieves' Island? Robbers and murderers hang there in iron chains, exactly as they hung in those days. The wind blew until it rattled the long skeletons, but the moon shone down on them as serenely as it now shines on a country dance. The sun also shone down pleasantly, crumbling away the dangling skeletons, and from the sunbeams the children of light sang, 'We know it! We know it! Here it shall be beautiful in the days to come; here it shall be good and splendid!'\n\n\" 'Chicken prattle!' said the northeast wind.\n\n\"Now we'll turn the page,\" said Godfather.\n\n\"The bells were ringing in the town of Roskilde, where Bishop Absalon lived. He could both read his Bible and wield his sword; he had power and will. He wished to protect from assault the busy fishermen at the harbor, whose town had grown until it was now a market town. He sprinkled the unhallowed ground with holy water; thus, Thieves' Island received the mark of honor. Masons and carpenters set to work on it; at the Bishop's command, a building grew up, and the sunbeams kissed the red walls as they rose. There stood the house of Axel:\n\nThe castle, with its towers, so stately and high,\nHad balconies and stairs up to the sky\nBooo! Whooo!\nThe northeast wind huffed and puffed,\nBut the castle stood unyielding, unruffed.\n\"And outside it lay 'The Haven,' the merchants' harbor:\n\nMermaid's bower amid seas of sheen,\nBuilt beside groves of green.\n\"The foreigners came there and bought the wealth of fish, and built shops and houses with bladders for windowpanes, as glass was too expensive. Warehouses followed, with gables and windlasses. See the old fellows sitting there in the shops - they dare not marry; they trade in ginger and pepper, the pebersvende.\n\n\"The northeast wind whistled through the streets and lanes, sending the dust flying and tearing off a thatched roof. Cows and pigs wandered about in the street ditch.\n\n\" 'I shall tame and subdue them!' said the northeast wind. 'I'll whistle around the houses and around Axel's house! I can't fail! They call it Gallows' Castle on Thieves' Island.'\"\n\nThen Godfather showed a picture of it, which he himself had drawn. On the wall were rows of stakes, and on every stake was the head of a captured pirate showing its teeth.\n\n\"That really happened,\" said Godfather. \"And it's worth hearing and worth knowing about.\n\n\"Bishop Absalon was in his bath, and through the thin walls he heard the arrival of a ship of freebooters. He instantly sprang out of the bath and into his ship, blew his horn, and his crew assembled. The arrows shot into the backs of the robbers as they rowed desperately to escape. The arrows pierced into their hands, and there was no time to pull them out. Bishop Absalon caught everyone and cut their heads off, and every head was set up on the outer wall of the castle. The northeast wind blew with puffed-out cheeks - with bad weather in his jaw, as the sailors say.\n\n\" 'I'll stretch myself,' said the wind. 'Here I'll lie down and look the whole matter over.'\n\n\"It rested for hours, then blew for days. Years went past.\n\n\"The watchman appeared on the castle tower; he looked to the east, the west, the north, and the south. You can see it there in the picture,\" said Godfather, pointing it out. \"You can see him there, but I'll tell you what he saw.\n\n\"There is open water from the wall of Stejleborg right out to Kjöge Bay, and a broad channel over to the coast of Zealand. In front of Serritslev and Solberg Meadows, with their large villages, the new town, with its gabled timber houses, is growing up more and more. There are entire streets for shoemakers and tailors, for grocers and beer sellers; there is a market place and there is a guildhall, and near the shore, where there was once an island, stands the splendid Church of St. Nicolaus. It has an immensely high tower and spire; how it is reflected in the clear water! Near this is Our Lady's Church, where Masses are sung, where incense gives out its fragrance and wax candles burn. The 'merchants' haven' is now the Bishop's town; the Bishop of Roskilde rules and reigns there.\n\n\"Bishop Erlandsen sits in Axel's house. There is good cooking in the kitchen; ale and claret are served to the sound of fiddles and kettledrums. Burning candles and lamps make the castle shine as if it were a lantern for the whole country and kingdom. The northeast wind whistles around the tower and walls, but they stand firmly. The northeast wind swoops around the western fortification of the town - only an old wooden fence - but it holds up well. Christopher I, King of Denmark, stands outside it; the rebels have beaten him at Skelskör, so he seeks shelter in the Bishop's town.\n\n\"The wind whistles, and says, like the Bishop, 'Keep out! Keep out! The gate is shut to you!'\n\n\"It is a time of trouble, dismal days, when every man is his own master. The Holstein banner waves from the castle tower. There is want and woe, for it is the night of anguish. War and the black death stalk the land in the pitch-dark night - but then comes Valdemar Atterdag. Now the Bishop's town is the King's town. It has gabled houses and narrow streets, watchmen and a town hall, and a permanent gallows by the west port. No man from out of town can be hanged on it; you must be a citizen to be allowed to dangle there, to get so high as to see Kjöge and the hens of Kjöge.\n\n\" 'That's a lovely gallows,' says the northeast wind. 'The beautiful is growing!' And it whistles and whoops.\n\n\"And from Germany blew trouble and want.\n\n\"The Hanseatic merchants came,\" continued Godfather, \"from warehouse and counter, the rich traders of Rostock, Lübeck, and Bremen. They wanted to seize more than the golden goose from Valdemar's Tower; they had more power in the town of the Danish King than the Danish King himself. They came in armed ships, and no one was prepared. And King Eric had no desire to fight with his German kinsfolk; they were too many and too strong. So King Eric and all his courtiers escaped through the west port to the town of Sorö, to the quiet lake and green forests, to the song of love and the clang of goblets.\n\n\"But there was one left behind in Copenhagen, a kingly heart and a kingly mind. Do you see this picture here, this young woman, so fine and tender, with sea-blue eyes and yellow hair? It is the Queen of Denmark, Philippa, the English princess. She stayed in the distracted city, where the townspeople swarmed in panic in the narrow lanes and streets with steep stairs, sheds, and shops of lath and plaster. With the courage of a man, she summoned townspeople and peasants, to inspire and encourage them. They fitted out the ships and garrisoned the blockhouses; they fired with their carbines; there were fire and smoke and lightness of spirit - our Lord will never forsake Denmark! The sun shone into all hearts, and in all eyes was the bright gladness of victory. Blessed be Philippa! Blessed she was in hut and in house; and blessed she was in the King's castle, where she nursed the wounded and the sick. I have clipped a wreath and laid it around this picture,\" said Godfather. \"Blessed be Queen Philippa!\"\n\n\"Now we spring forward for years,\" said Godfather, \"and Copenhagen springs with us. King Christian I has been to Rome to receive the Pope's blessing and has been greeted with honor and homage on the long journey. Here at home he is building a hall of red brick; there shall be learning there, displaying itself in Latin. The poor man's children, from plow and workshop, can also come there, to live upon alms, to attain the long black gown, and sing before the doors of citizens.\n\n\"Near the hall of learning, where everything is in Latin, is a little house where Danish rules, in language and in customs. There is beer soup for early breakfast, and dinner is at ten o'clock in the morning. The sun shines through small panes onto cupboards and bookcases; on the shelves are written treasures - Master Mikkel's Rosaryand Godly Comedies, Henrik Harpestreng's Leech-book,and Denmark's Rhyming Chronicle by Brother Niels of Sorö. 'Every Danish man should know these,' says the master of the house, and he is the one to make them known. He is the Dutchman, Gotfred van Gehmen, Denmark's first printer, who practices the divine black art of printing.\n\n\" And the books enter the castle of the King and the houses of the citizens. Proverbs and songs are given immortality. Things that men dare not say either in sorrow or in joy are sung by the Bird of Folklore, allegorically and yet clearly. For it flies free and wide through the common man's room and the knightly castle; it sits and twitters like a falcon on the hand of the noble lady; it steals in like a tiny mouse and squeaks in the dungeon of the enslaved peasant.\n\n\" 'Merely words - all of it!' says the sharp northeast wind.\n\n\" 'It's the spring!' say the sunbeams. 'See how the green buds are peeping out!'\n\n\"Now we'll turn more pages in our picture book,\" said Godfather.\n\n\"How radiant Copenhagen is! There are tournaments and sports and splendid processions! Look at the gallant knights in armor and the noble ladies in silk and gold! King Hans gives his daughter, Elizabeth, to the Elector of Brandenburg. How young she is, and how happy she is! She is treading on velvet; there is a whole future in her thoughts - a future of domestic happiness. Close beside her is her royal brother, Prince Christian, with the melancholy eyes and the hot, passionate blood. He is beloved by the commoners, for he knows their burdens; in his thoughts he has the poor man's future. God alone decides our fate!\n\n\"Now we'll turn another leaf in the picture book,\" said Godfather. \"The wind blows sharply and sings of the sharp sword and this difficult time of trouble.\n\n\"It is an icy-cold day in mid-April. Why is the crowd gathering outside the castle and before the old customhouse, where the King's ship lies with its sails and banners? People are crowded in the windows and on the roofs. There are sorrow and trouble, expectation and anxiety. They look toward the castle, now so still and empty, but where formerly there were torch dances in the gilded halls; they look at the balcony from which King Christian so often gazed out over the 'court bridge' and down the narrow court-bridge street to his dovelet, the little Dutch girl he brought from the town of Bergen. The shutters are bolted. As the crowd gazed toward the castle, the gate is opened and the drawbridge is let down. There comes King Christian with his faithful wife, Elizabeth; she will not forsake her royal lord, now when he is so hard pressed.\n\n\"There is fire in his blood and fire in his thoughts; he has wished to break with the olden times, to strike off the peasants' yoke, to do good to the commoners, to clip the wings of the 'greedy hawks,' but they have been too much for him. He leaves his country and his kingdom, to win allies and friends for himself abroad. His wife and loyal men go with him. Every eye is moist in this hour of parting.\n\n\"Voices are blended in the song of time, against him and for him a three-part choir.\n\n\"Listen to the words of the nobles; they are written and printed: 'Woe to you, Christian the Wicked! The blood that poured out in the market place of Stockholm cries aloud and curses you!'\n\n\"And the monks' cry echoes the same refrain: 'Be you cast off by God and by us! You have called hither the Lutheran doctrine; you have given it church and pulpit and bid the tongue of the Devil speak out! Woe to you, Christian the Wicked!'\n\n\"But the peasants and commoners weep: 'Christian, beloved of the people! No longer may the peasant be sold like cattle or exchanged for a hunting hound! That law shall bear you witness!' But the words of the poor man are only chaff before the wind.\n\n\"Now the ship sails past the castle, and the commoners line the ramparts, so that they may once more see the royal galley sail.\n\n\" 'The time is long; the time is hard. Trust neither in friends nor in kinsmen!'\n\n\"Uncle Frederick in the Castle of Kiel would like to be King of Denmark. King Frederick is before Copenhagen. See the picture here - 'The Faithful Copenhagen.' Coal-black clouds are around it - in picture after picture; just look at each of them! It is all a resounding picture; it resounds still in song and story - those heavy, hard, and bitter times during the long procession of years.\n\n\"How did it go with that wandering bird, King Christian? The birds have sung about it, and they fly far over distant lands and seas.\n\n\"Early in the spring the stork came from the south, across the land of Germany; it had seen what I will tell you now.\n\n\" 'I saw the fugitive King Christian crossing a heather - grown moor; he met a wretched cart drawn by only one horse. A woman sat in it, his sister, the Countess of Brandenburg. Faithful to the Lutheran religion, she had been exiled by her husband. And so on that dark heath the exiled children of a king met. The time is hard; the time is long. Trust neither friend nor kinsman!'\n\n\"The swallow came from Sönderborg Castle with a sad song, 'King Christian is betrayed! He sits in the dungeon tower, deep as a well; his heavy steps wear tracks in the stone floor, and his fingers leave their marks in the hard marble.'\n\nOh, what sorrow ever found such vent\nAs that in the furrows of the stone?\n\"The fish eagle has come from the tossing sea, which is open and free. A ship flies over it, bearing the brave Sören Norby from Fyn. Fortune is with him - but fortune is as changeable as wind and weather.\n\n\"In Jutland and Fyn the crows and ravens scream, 'We seek spoil! It is grand! Caw, caw! Here lie the bodies of horses and of men, too!' It is a time of trouble; it is during the Count of Oldenburg's war. The peasant raises his club and the townsman his knife, and loudly they shout, 'We shall slay the wolves and leave no cub of them alive!' Clouds of smoke roll up from the burning towns.\n\n\"King Christian is a prisoner in Sönderborg Castle; he cannot escape or see the bitter distress of Copenhagen. On the North Common stands Christian III, where his father stood before him. Despair is in the city, and plague, and famine.\n\n\"A ragged, emaciated woman sits reclined against the church wall. She is a corpse; two living children lie on her lap and can suck only blood from the dead breast.\n\n\"Courage has collapsed; resistance collapses. Oh, you faithful Copenhagen!\n\n\"Fanfares are blown, hear the drums and trumpets! In rich garments of silk and velvet, with nodding plumes, the noble lords come on horses adorned with gold, riding to Old Market Square. Is there a customary festivity or tournament? Commoners and peasants in holiday attire flock in that direction. What is there to see? Is there a bonfire to burn popish images? Or is the hangman standing there, as he stood at the death fire of Slaghoek? The King, ruler of all the land, is a Lutheran, and this shall now be proclaimed with solemnity.\n\n\"Noble ladies and highborn maidens, with high collars and caps of pearls, sit behind the open windows and see all the splendor. Beneath a canopy near the King's throne, the councilors of state sit in antique dress on an outspread carpet. The King is silent, but his will, the will of the council of state, is proclaimed in the Danish tongue. Commoners and peasants are sternly rebuked for the opposition they have shown to the nobility. The commoner is humbled, and the peasant becomes a slave. Now condemning words are uttered against the bishops of the land. Their power is gone, and all the property of the church and cloisters is transferred to the King and the nobles.\n\n\"Pride and hatred are there, and pomp and misery, too.\n\nThe poor bird comes limping, drooping,\nComes stooping.\nThe rich bird comes huffing,\nComes puffing.\n\"The time of change brings heavy clouds, but sunshine, too; it then shines in the halls of learning and in the student's home. And names shine from it on down to our own days. There is Hans Tousen, the son of a poor smith of Fyn:\n\nThis was the little lad who came from Birkende town;\nHis name flew over Denmark; widely spread his renown.\nA Danish Martin Luther, he drew the Gospel sword,\nAnd gained a mighty victory for truth and for the Lord.\n\"There is also the immortal name of Petrus Palladius; that is the Latin, but in Danish it is Peter Plade, Bishop of Roskilde, also the son of a poor smith of Jutland. And among noblemen shines the name of Hans Friis, Chancellor of the kingdom. He would seat the students at his own table and see to their wants and those of the schoolboys as well. But one name above all others is greeted with cheers and song.\n\nSo long as there's a student to be found\nNear Axel's Haven, at work or play,\nWill King Christian's name loudly resound\nAnd with hurrahs be greeted every day!\n\"Yes, there were sunbeams between the heavy clouds in the time of change.\n\n\"Now we turn the page.\n\n\"What is it that whistles and sings in the Great Belt under the coast of Samsö? A mermaid, with sea-green hair, rises from the sea; she reveals the future to the peasant. A prince shall be born who shall become a great and powerful king.\"\n\n\"He was born in the field, beneath the blossoming whitethorn. His name now lives in song and story, in the knightly halls and castles everywhere. The stock exchange came forth with tower and spire; Rosenborg Castle rose up and gazed far out over the ramparts; the students got their own house. And close by, where it still points to heaven, stood 'the Round Tower,' facing toward the island of Hveen, where Uranienborg once stood. Its golden domes glittered in the moonlight, and the mermaids sang of the man who lived there, whom kings and sages visited, the master sage of noble blood - Tycho Brahe. He raised the name of Denmark so high that it was known with the stars of heaven in all the cultured lands of the earth. And Denmark turned him away.\n\n\"In his sorrow he sang for comfort:\n\nIs not heaven everywhere?\nWhat more do I require?\n\"His song lives in the hearts of the people, like the mermaid's song about Christian IV.\n\n\"Now comes a page that you must look at carefully,\" said Godfather.\n\n\"There is picture after picture here, just as there is verse after verse in the old ballads. It is a song, so happy in its beginning, so sorrowful at its close.\n\n\"A king's child is dancing in the castle of the King. How lovely she is to look at! She is sitting on the lap of Christian IV - his beloved daughter, Eleonore. She grows in all the virtues and graces of a woman. The foremost among the nobles, Corfits Ulfeldt, is her betrothed. She is still only a child and is beaten by her stern governess; she complains of this to her sweetheart, and rightly, too. How clever and cultured and learned she is! She can speak Latin and Greek, sing in Italian to her lute, and talk about the Pope and Martin Luther.\n\n\"Now King Christian lies in the vault in Roskilde Cathedral, and Eleonore's brother is King. In the palace at Copenhagen there are pomp and show; there are beauty and wit - and foremost is the Queen herself, Sophie Amalie of Lyneborg. Who can guide her horse as cleverly as she? Who dances with such grace? Who can talk with such wisdom and wit as the Queen of Denmark?\n\n\" 'Eleonore Christine Ulfeldt!' These are the words of the French Ambassador. 'She surpasses all in beauty and wit!'\n\n\"Up from the polished floor of the palace ballroom has grown the burdock of envy; it has clung there, worked itself in, and twisted around - contempt and scorn. 'That illegitimate creature! Her carriage shall stop at the bridge of the castle! Where the Queen drives, the commoner shall walk!' There is a storm of gossip, of lies and slander.\n\n\"Then Ulfeldt takes his wife by the hand in the still of the night. He has the keys to the town gates; he opens one of them, and horses wait outside. They ride to the shore and sail to Sweden.\n\n\"Now let's turn the page, just as fortune turned itself for those two.\n\n\"It is autumn. The days are short and the nights are long; it is gray and damp. The cold wind rises in its strength, and it whistles through the leaves of the trees on the ramparts. The leaves drop into Peter Oxe's courtyard, empty and forsaken of its owners. The wind sweeps over Christianshavn, around the mansion of Kai Lykke, which now is a penitentiary. He himself has been driven from home and honor; his escutcheon is smashed and his effigy hung on the highest gallows. Thus is he punished for his thoughtless, frivolous words about the powerful Queen of Denmark. The wind pipes loudly as it rushes over the open space where the mansion of the Lord High Steward once stood. Only one stone of it is now left, 'And that I drove down here as a boulder on the floating ice,' shrieks the wind. 'That stone stranded where since has grown Thieves' Island, under my curse, and so it became a part of the mansion of Lord Ulfeldt, where his lady sang to the sounding lute, and read Greek and Latin, and bore herself proudly. Now only the stone is here with its inscription:\n\nThe traitor Corfits Ulfeldt\nIn eternal scorn, shame, and disgrace.\n\" 'But where is the stately lady now? Whoo-ee-oo!' blows the wind with a piercing shriek.\n\n\"For many years she has been shut up in the Blue Tower, behind the palace, where the sea water beats against the slimy walls. There is more smoke than warmth in the cell; its tiny window is high up under the ceiling. In what discomfort and misery sits the adored child of Christian IV, the daintiest of maids and matrons! Memory hangs curtains and tapestries on the smoke-blackened walls of her prison. She recalls the lovely days of her childhood, her father's gentle, beaming face; she recalls her splendid wedding, her days of pride, but also her days of misery in Holland, England, and Bornholm.\n\nNothing seems too hard for wedded love to bear,\nAnd loyalty is not cause for shame or care.\n\"But he was with her in those days; now she is alone, alone forever. She does not know his grave; no one knows it.\n\nFaithfulness to her husband was her only crime.\n\"For long and many years she sat there, while life went on outside. Life never pauses, but we will for a moment here, and think of her and the words of the song.\n\nI keep my promise to my husband still,\nIn want and dire need, and always will.\n\"Now do you see this picture here?\" said Godfather. \"It's winter, and the frost has thrown a bridge of ice between Laaland and Fyn, a bridge for Carl Gustav, who pushes on unchecked. There are plundering and burning, fear and want, throughout the whole land.\n\n\"Now the Swedes are encamped before Copenhagen. It is bitterly cold and the snow is blinding, but, true to their king and themselves, men and women stand ready to fight. Every tradesman, shopman, student, and schoolmaster is on the ramparts, ready to guard and defend, with no fear of the red-hot cannon balls. King Frederick has sworn he will die in his nest. There he rides to and fro, and the Queen is with him, and courage, patriotism, and discipline are there. Let the Swede don his white shroud and crawl forward in the white snow and try to storm the walls! Beams and stones are hurled down on him; even women come with steaming caldrons and pour boiling pitch and tar onto the storming enemy.\n\n\"That night King and peasant are one united power. Then there is relief, and there is victory. Church bells ring, and songs of thanksgiving resound. Commoners, on this spot you won your knightly spurs!\n\n\"What comes next? Look at this picture. Bishop Svane's wife drives in a closed carriage, which only the high and mighty nobility dare do. The proud young men stop the carriage; the bishop's wife must walk to the bishop's house.\n\n\"Is that the whole story? Something much greater is stopped next - the power of pride.\n\n\"Burgomaster Hans Nansen and Bishop Svane clasp hands to work in the name of the Lord. Their wise and honest talk is heard in the church and the house of the commoner. One handclasp of fellowship, and the harbor is blocked, the gates are locked, and the alarm bell rings.\n\n\"Power is granted to the King alone, who remains in his nest in the hour of peril; he governs, and rules over great and small. It is the time of absolute monarchy.\n\n\"Now let's turn the page, and time with it.\n\n\" 'Halloo, halloo, halloo!' The plow stands idle, and the heather grows wild, but the hunting is good. 'Halloo, halloo!' Listen to the sounding horn and the baying hounds! See the huntsmen, and look at the young and gay King himself, Christian V! There is merrymaking in palace and in town. In the halls are waxlights, in the courtyards torches, and in the streets of the town are new lamps. Everything is so new! Favors and gifts go to the barons and counts of the new nobility, brought in from Germany. Nothing is accepted now except titles and rank and the German language.\n\n\"But then there sounds a voice that is truly Danish, the voice of the weaver's son, who is now a bishop; it is the voice of Kingo, singing his beautiful psalms.\n\n\"There is another commoner's son, this time the son of a vintner, whose thoughts shine forth in law and justice. His book of laws has become gold-ground for the King's name, and will stand for ages to come. That commoner's son, the greatest man in the land, receives a coat of arms - and enemies as well, so that the sword of the executioner is raised over the head of Griffenfeld.\n\n\"But mercy is granted, with life imprisonment, and he is banished to a rocky islet off the coast of Trondhjem.\n\nMunkholm - Denmark's St. Helena\n\"But the dance continues merrily in the palace hall; there are splendor and pomp there, and courtiers and ladies dance to lively music.\n\n\"Now these are the times of Frederick IV!\n\n\"See the proud ships with their flags of victory! See the tossing sea! It can tell of great deeds for the glory of Denmark. We remember the victorious Sehested and Gyldenlöve! We remember Hvitfeldt, who blew up his ship to save the Danish fleet, and flew to heaven with Dannebrog. We think of the struggles of those ages, and of the hero who sprang to the defense of Denmark from the mountains of Norway - Peder Tordenskjold.\n\nAcross the surging sea his name thunders from country to country.\n\nLightning flashed through the powder dust;\nA thunderbolt roared through the whispering age.\nA tailor's boy jumped down from the tailor's table;\nFrom Norway's coast he sailed a little sloop.\nAnd over Northern seas there flew again\nThe viking spirit, youthful, and clad in steel.\n\"Then a fresh breeze blew from the coast of Greenland, bringing a gentle fragrance, as if from the land of Bethlehem; it brought tidings of the Gospel light kindled by Hans Egede and his wife.\n\n\"So this half page has a golden ground; but the other half, which means sorrow, is ashen gray with black specks, as from fire and disease and pestilence.\n\n\"The plague is raging in Copenhagen. The streets are empty. The doors are barred, and where crosses are chalked on them the plague is inside, but where the cross is black all within are dead.\n\n\"The bodies are carried away by night, with no tolling bell; the half dead in the streets are taken with them. Funeral wagons rumble, piled with corpses. But from the taverns sound the horrid songs and wild shrieks of the drunkards. They try to forget their bitter in drink; they want to forget, and end - end! Yes, everything comes to an end. The page ends here, with the second time of distress and trial for Copenhagen.\n\n\"King Frederick IV is still alive. The course of the years has turned his hair gray. From the window of his palace he looks out on the stormy weather of late winter.\n\n\"In a little house near the Westgate a boy is playing with his ball; it bounces up into the loft. The child takes a candle and goes up to seek it, but he sets fire to the little house - to the whole street. The fire leaps into the air so that the clouds themselves reflect it! See how the flames grow higher! There is food for the fire - hay and straw, bacon and tar, piles of firewood for winter - and it all burns. There is weeping, shrieking; there is great panic. The old King rides through the tumult, commanding and encouraging. There is blowing up with gunpowder, and the tearing down of houses. Now the fire has swept into the north quarter, and the churches are burning, St. Peter's and Our Lady's. Listen to the bells playing their last tune, 'Turn from Us Thy Wrath, O Lord God of Mercy!'\n\n\"Only the 'Round Tower' and the castle are left standing, with smoking ruins about them. King Frederick is kind to the people; he is a friend to the homeless; he comforts and feeds them and is with them constantly. Blessed be Frederick IV!\n\n\"Now look at this page!\n\n\"See that gilded carriage with footmen around it and armed riders before and behind it, coming from the castle, where an iron chain is stretched to keep the people from coming too near! Every common man must cross the square with bare head; and therefore few are seen there; they avoid the place. There comes one now, with downcast eyes, and with hat in hand, and he is the one man of that time whom we can name with pride:\n\nHis voice like a cleansing storm wind rang.\nTo sunshine in the days which yet were to come!\nThen smuggled-in tunes like grasshoppers sprang\nIn haste to return to where they were from.\n\"Witty and humorous - that is Ludvig Holberg. The Danish stage, the castle of his greatness, has been closed as if it were the dwelling place of shame. All merriment is banished; dance, song, and music are forbidden and gone. For the dark side of religion is now in power.\n\n\" 'The Danish prince!' his mother used to call him. Now come his days of sunshine, with the song of birds, with gladness and true Danish gaiety. Frederick V is King, and the chain is taken from the square beside the castle; the Danish theater is reopened; there are laughter and pleasure and good cheer. And the peasants again hold their summer festivals, for it is a time of joy after the time of fast and oppression. The beautiful lives again, blossoming and bearing fruit in sound, color, and creative art. Listen to Grétry's music! Watch Londemann's acting! And Denmark's Queen loves all that is Danish. God in His heaven bless you, beautiful and gentle Louise of England! The sunbeams sing in spirited chorus about the queens of Denmark - Philippa, Elizabeth, Louise!\n\n\"The earthly shells have long been buried, but the souls live, and the names live. England again sends a royal bride, Matilde, so young and so soon forsaken! In days to come poets will sing of your youthful heart and your hours of trail! And song has an indescribable power through all times and all peoples. See the burning of the castle of King Christian! They try to save the best they can find. Look at the men from the dockyard dragging away a basket of silverware and precious things - a great treasure! But suddenly through an open door, where the flames are brightest, they see a bronze bust of King Christian IV. Then they cast aside the treasure they are rescuing; his image means so much more to them that it must be saved, regardless of how heavy it may be to carry. They know him from the song of Ewald and the beautiful melody of Hartmann.\n\n\"Indeed, there is power in words and song, and someday it shall resound as strongly for the poor Queen Matilde.\n\n\"Now let's go further in our picture book.\n\n\"On Ulfeldt's Place stood the stone of shame, and where in the world is there one like it? By the Westgate a column was raised, and how many in the world are there like it?\n\n\"The sunbeams kissed the boulder foundation of the Column of Freedom. All church bells rang and the flags waved, and the people cheered for Crown Prince Frederick. The names of Bernstorff, Reventlow, Colbjörnsen were held in the hearts and were on the lips of old and young. With bright eyes and grateful hearts they read the blessed inscription on the column:\n\n\" 'The King has decreed that serfdom shall cease, the agrarian laws be set in order and enforced, so that the free peasant may become brave and enlightened, diligent and good, a worthy and happy citizen!'\n\n\"What a sunny day! Summer is in town!\n\n\"The spirits of light sang, 'The good is growing! The beautiful is growing! Soon the stone on Ulfeldt's Place shall fall, but the Column of Freedom shall stand in the sunlight, blessed by God, King, and people.'\n\nWe have an ancient highway;\nIt goes to the ends of the earth.\n\"There in the open sea - open for friend and foe - was the foe! The mighty English fleet sailed up; a great power came against a little one. The battle was hard, but the people were valiant.\n\nEach stood firm, untiring, held his place,\nStood and fought until death's embrace.\n\"They won the admiration of the enemy and inspired the poets of Denmark. The day of that battle is still commemorated with unfurled banners - Denmark's glorious Second of April, the Maundy Thursday battle at Copenhagen Harbor.\n\n\"Years passed. A fleet was seen in Öresund. Was it bound for Russia or for Denmark? No one knew, not even those on board the ships.\n\n\"There is a legend in the hearts of the people which tells that on that morning in Öresund, when the sealed orders were opened and the instructions to destroy the Danish fleet were read, a young captain stepped forward, a son of Britain, noble in word and deed. 'I swore,' he said, 'that I would fight for England's flag to my death, in open and honorable battle, but not overpower the weak!' And with that he jumped overboard!\n\nThe fleet sailed toward Copenhagen just the same;\nBut far from the place where the battle was to be\nLay he, the captain - and unknown is his name -\nAn ice-cold corpse, in the dark-blue sea.\nShoreward he drifted, until Swedish men,\nFishing beneath the stars with their nets,\nFound him, bore him to shore, and then\nCast dice to win his epaulets!\n\"The enemy made for Copenhagen. The town was soon in flames. We lost our fleet, but not our courage and faith in God; He casteth down but He raiseth again. Our wounds healed, as those of the warriors in Valhalla. The history of Copenhagen is rich in consolation.\n\nOur faith, from the beginning of time to the end,\nIs that Our Lord is Denmark's friend;\nIf we hold firmly, He will hold, too,\nAnd tomorrow the sun will shine on you.\n\"Soon the sun did shine on the rebuilt city, on the rich cornfields, and on the skill and art of our people. It was blessed summer day of peace, when poetry raised her Fata Morgana, so rich in color, through the words of Oehlenschläger.\n\n\"And a great discovery was made in science. It was a discovery far greater than the gold horn of ancient days, for a bridge of gold was found:\n\nA bridge for thought to flash like lightning\nAt all times into other lands and nations.\n\"Hans Christian Örsted wrote his name on that bridge. And look! Beside the church by the castle a building was raised to which the poorest man and woman gladly gave their pennies.\n\n\"You will remember that in the first part of our picture book,\" said Godfather, \"the old stone blocks rolled down from the mountains of Norway and were carried here on the ice. They are raised up again from the sandy depths at the bidding of Thorvaldsen, in marble beauty, magnificent to look at!\n\n\"Remember all that I have shown you and all that I have told you! That sandbank in the sea raised itself up to become a breakwater in the harbor; it bore Axel's house, and the Bishop's mansion, and the King's castle, and now it bears the temple of the beautiful. The words of the curse have vanished, but all that the children of sunlight sang in their gladness about the coming ages has been fulfilled. Many storms have passed; they will come again and pass again. The true and the good and the beautiful have the victory.\n\n\"And that finishes the picture book, but not the history of Copenhagen - far from it! Who knows what you may live to see! It has often looked black, and storms have raged, but the sunshine has never been blown away - it remains. And stronger yet than the brightest sunshine is God! Our Lord reigns over more than Copenhagen.\"\n\nThat is what Godfather said as he gave me the book. His eyes were shining; he was so certain of it all. And I took the book so gladly and proudly and carefully, just the way I carried my little sister for the first time.\n\nAnd Godfather said, \"You're quite welcome to show your picture book to people, and you may also tell them that I made it, pasted it, and drew the whole thing. But it's of great importance that they know at once where I got the idea for it. You know where, so tell them! The idea came from the old oil lamps, which, on the last evening they burned, showed the new gaslights, like a Fata Morgana, everything that had been seen from the time the first lamp was lit at the harbor until that evening when Copenhagen was lighted with both oil and gas.\n\n\"You may show the book to anybody you like; that is, to people with kindly eyes and friendly minds; but if a hell horse should come, then close Godfather's picture book.\""

      "body": "The Nightingale and the Rose:\n\n“She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried the young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red rose.”\n\nFrom her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.  “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.”\n“Here at last is a true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.”\n“The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student, “and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.”\n“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale.  “What I sing of, he suffers—what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful thing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.  Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.”\n“The musicians will sit in their gallery,” said the young Student, “and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her”; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.\n“Why is he weeping?” asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.\n“Why, indeed?” said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.\n“Why, indeed?” whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.\n“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.\n“For a red rose?” they cried; “how very ridiculous!” and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student’s sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n“My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student’s window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.”\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student’s window.\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song.”\nBut the Tree shook its head.\n“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.”\n“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose!  Is there no way by which I can get it?”\n“There is away,” answered the Tree; “but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.”\n“Tell it to me,” said the Nightingale, “I am not afraid.”\n“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood.  You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.”\n“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?”\nSo she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.\n“Be happy,” cried the Nightingale, “be happy; you shall have your red rose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart’s-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.”\nThe Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n“Sing me one last song,” he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.”\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n“She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove—“that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am afraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.”  And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.  And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.  “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come before the rose is finished.”\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.  But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose’s heart remained white, for only a Nightingale’s heart’s-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.  “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day will come before the rose is finished.”\nSo the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.  Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.  Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.\nBut the Nightingale’s voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.\nThen she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.\n“Look, look!” cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now”; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose!  I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name”; and he leaned down and plucked it.\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor’s house with the rose in his hand.\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,” cried the Student.  “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.”\nBut the girl frowned.\n“I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; “and, besides, the Chamberlain’s nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.”\n“Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,” said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.\n“Ungrateful!” said the girl.  “I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don’t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain’s nephew has”; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.\n“What I a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.  “It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.”\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read."

      "body": "The Toad:\n\nThe well was deep, and therefore the rope was long; the wheel went around with difficulty when the waterfilled bucket had to be pulled up over the side of the well. The sun could never mirror itself down in the water, no matter how brightly it shone; but as far down as its rays penetrated, green weeds were growing from between the stones.\n\nThere was a family of toads living down there. It was an immigrant family which, as a matter of fact, had come down there headlong in the person of the old toad mother, who was still living. The green frogs that swam in the water had made their homes there for a much longer time, but they acknowledged their cousins and called them \"well guests.\" The latter, however, had no thoughts of ever leaving, they found it very comfortable here on the dry land, as they called the wet stones.\n\nMamma Frog had once traveled; she'd been in the bucket when it had gone up, but the light above had been too strong for her and given her a frightful pain in the eyes. Luckily she had managed to get out of the bucket. She'd fallen into the water with a tremendous splash and been laid up for three days with a backache. She didn't have much to tell about the world above, but she did know, and so did all the others, that the well wasn't the whole world. Mamma Toad, on the other hand, might have told them a few things about it, but she never answered when anyone inquired, so they stopped inquiring.\n\n\"Big and ugly, fat and loathsome, she is!\" said the young green frogs. \"And her brats are getting to be just like her!\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said Mamma Toad, \"but one of them has a jewel in its head, if I don't have it myself!\"\n\nAnd the green frogs listened and stared at her, and as they didn't like this news, they made faces at her and dived down to the bottom. But the young toads stretched out their hind legs proudly. Each of them thought it was the one which had the jewel, so they all kept their heads quite rigid, but at last they began to ask what it was they had to be proud of and just what a jewel was, anyway.\n\n\"It's something so glorious and precious,\" said Mamma Toad, \"that I can't describe it. It's something you wear for your own pleasure and others become irritated over. But ask no more, for I won't answer.\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't got the jewel,\" said the smallest Toad, which was as ugly as it could be. \"Why should I have anything so splendid? And if it irritates others, why, it wouldn't please me. No, all I want is to get up to the top of the well sometime and take one peep out! It must be wonderful up there!\"\n\n\"Better stay where you are,\" said the old Toad. \"You're at home here, and you know what it's like. Keep away from the bucket, or it may squash you! And even if you did get safely into it you might fall out. Not everyone can come down as luckily as I did and keep limbs and eggs all safe and sound.\"\n\n\"Croak!\" said the little one; and that was the same as when we humans say, \"Oh!\"\n\nIt had such a great desire to get up to the top of the well and look out; it felt an intense longing for the green things up there. And next morning, when the bucket, filled with water, was being pulled up and happened to pause for an instant beside the stone where the Toad sat, the little creature quivered through and through and then jumped into the bucket. It sank to the bottom of the water, which soon was drawn up and emptied out.\n\n\"Phooie, what a nuisance!\" said the man when he saw it. \"That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen!\" And then he kicked with his heavy wooden shoe at the Toad, which came close to being crippled, but managed to escape into the middle of some tall nettles. It saw stalk after stalk around it; it looked upward and saw the sun shining on the leaves, making them quite transparent.\n\nFor the Toad it was the same as it is for us when we come suddenly into a great forest, where the sun shines between leaves and branches.\n\n\"It's much prettier here than down in that well! You could stay here for your whole lifetime!\" said the little Toad. It lay there for an hour; it lay there for two hours. \"Now what could there be outside? Since I've come this far I might as well go farther.\" So it crept as fast as it could, until it came out into the road, where the sun shone on it; and then it was powdered with dust as it hopped across the road.\n\n\"Here one is really on dry land,\" said the Toad. \"I'm getting almost too much of a good thing; it tickles right through me!\"\n\nNow it reached a ditch, where grew forget-me-nots and meadowsweet, while beyond it was a hedge of white thorn and elderbushes, with convolvulus creeping and hanging about it. What vivid colors there were to see here! And here flew a butterfly, too. The Toad thought it was a flower that had torn itself loose in order to get a better look at the world; that, of course, was very reasonable.\n\n\"If I could only move about like that!\" said the Toad. \"Croak! Oh! How glorious!\"\n\nFor eight days and nights its remained by the ditch and felt no want of food. Then on the ninth day it thought, \"Oh, forward.\" But was there anything more beautiful to be found anywhere? Perhaps a little toad or some green frogs; there had been a sound in the wind the night before which had seemed to indicate there were cousins in the neighborhood.\n\n\"It's wonderful to be alive! To come up out of that well and lie in the bed of nettles, to creep along and hop across the dusty road and rest in the wet ditch! But on, further forward! I must find frogs or a little toad; one can't do without companions, after all. Nature alone isn't enough for one!\" And so it started its wanderings again.\n\nIn a field, it came to a large pond with rushes around it, and it went exploring in there.\n\n\"It's too wet for you in here, isn't it?\" said the frog inside. \"But you're quite welcome. Are you a he or a she? Not that it matters; you're equally welcome in either case.\"\n\nAnd so it was invited to a concert that evening, a family concert, with a lot of gaiety and feeble voices; we all know that sort of affair. There were no refreshments, except free drinks - the whole pond, if they could drink it.\n\n\"Now I'll be traveling on,\" said the little Toad, which was always craving for something better.\n\nIt saw the stars twinkling, so large and so clear; it saw the new moon shine, and it saw the sun rise higher and higher.\n\n\"I think I'm still in a well, but a bigger well. I must get higher up! I feel a restlessness, a longing!\" And when the moon was full and round, the poor creature thought, \"I wonder if that is the bucket that's let down, and which I must hop into if I want to get higher? Or is the sun the big bucket? How large that is, and how bright! Why, it could hold all of us at once! I must watch for my chance! What a brightness there is in my head! I don't believe the jewel could shine more brightly. But I don't have the jewel, and I shall not cry for it. No; still higher in brightness and happiness! I feel confidence and yet fear. It's a hard step to take, but I must take it. On, further forward! Right on down the road!\"\n\nThen it moved along in leaps, as indeed such a creature can, until it reached the highway where humans lived. Here were both flower gardens and vegetable gardens. It stopped to rest by a cabbage garden.\n\n\"How many different beings there are that I've never known of! And how great and blessed the world is! But you must keep looking about you, instead of always sitting in the same place.\" And so it hopped into the cabbage garden. \"How green it is here! How pretty it is here!\"\n\n\"That I well know,\" said the Caterpillar on a cabbage leaf. \"My leaf is the largest one here; it covers half the world, and the rest of the world I can do without!\"\n\n\"Cluck! Cluck!\" said somebody, and hens came hopping into the garden.\n\nThe first Hen was farsighted; she spied the worm on the curly leaf and pecked at it so that it fell to the ground, where it lay twisting and turning. The Hen looked at it first with one eye and then with the other, for she couldn't figure out what would become of that wriggling.\n\n\"It isn't doing that of its own accord,\" thought the Hen, and she raised her head to strike again. Whereupon the Toad became so frightened that it bumped right into the Hen.\n\n\"So that thing has auxiliary troops to fight for it!\" she said. \"Just look at that vermin!\" Then the Hen turned away. \"I don't care about that little green mouthful; it would only tickle my throat!\" The other hens agreed with her, and so away they went.\n\n\"I got away from her with my wriggling,\" said the Caterpillar. \"It's good to keep your presence of mind, but the hardest job is ahead - to get back up onto my cabbage leaf. Where is it?\"\n\nThen the little Toad came forward to sympathize. It was happy that its own ugliness had frightened away the Hen.\n\n\"What makes you think that?\" asked the Caterpillar. \"I wriggled away from her myself. You're indeed very unpleasant to look at! Let me get back to my own place. Now I can smell cabbage; I'm near my own leaf! There's nothing so beautiful as one's own. But I must get up higher.\"\n\n\"Yes, higher!\" said the little Toad. \"Higher up! It feels just as I do, but it isn't in a good humor today, because of its fright. We all want to get up higher!\" And it looked up as high as it could.\n\nA stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farmhouse; he clattered and the stork mother clattered.\n\n\"How high up they live!\" thought the Toad. \"If only I could get up there!\"\n\nIn the farmhouse lived two young students; one was a poet, the other a naturalist. The one sang and wrote with gladness of all that God had created, as it was mirrored in his heart; he sang of it in short, clear, and rich, imposing verses. The other took hold of the creation itself, yes, and took it apart when it needed analyzing. He treated our Lord's work like a great piece of arithmetic; subtracted, multiplied, wanted to know it outside and inside, and to talk of it with intelligence, with complete understanding; and yet he talked of it with gladness and with wisdom. They were good, happy people, both of them.\n\n\"Why, there is a good specimen of a toad,\" said the Naturalist. \"I must have it to preserve in alcohol!\"\n\n\"You have two already,\" said the Poet. \"Let it stay there in peace and enjoy itself.\"\n\n\"But it's so beautifully ugly!\" said the other.\n\n\"If we could find the jewel in its head,\" said the Poet, \"then I myself would give you a hand at splitting it open.\"\n\n\"The jewel!\" said the other. \"How well you know your natural history!\"\n\n\"But isn't there something very splendid about the old folk legend that the toad, the ugliest of creatures, often has hidden in its head the most precious of jewels? Isn't it much the same with people? Wasn't there a jewel like that hidden in Aesop, and Socrates, too?\"\n\nThe Toad didn't hear any more, and hadn't understood half of what it had heard. The two friends went on, and it escaped being preserved in alcohol.\n\n\"They were talking about that jewel, too,\" said the Toad. \"It's good that I don't have it; otherwise I would have got into trouble.\"\n\nThen there was a clattering on the farmer's roof. Father Stork was giving a lecture to his family, and they were all looking down askance at the two young men in the cabbage garden.\n\n\"A human being is the most conceited of creatures,\" said the Stork.\n\n\"Hear how they go on jabbering, and yet they can't even make as much noise as a rattle! They crow over their eloquence, their language! A fine language that is! It becomes more unintelligible even to them with each day's journey. We can speak our language the whole world over, in Denmark or in Egypt. As for flying, they can't do that at all. They crawl along by means of an invention they call a railway, but there they often get their necks broken. I get the shivers in my bill when I think of it! The world can exist without people. We could well do without them. May we only have frogs and earthworms!\"\n\n\"My, that was a powerful speech!\" thought the little Toad. \"What a great man he is, and how high he sits up there! I never saw anyone that high before. And how well he can swim!\" it exclaimed, for just then the Stork soared off into the air on outstretched wings.\n\nAnd then Mother Stork talked in the nest. She told about the land of Egypt and the water of the Nile, and of all the wonderful mud there was to be found in foreign countries; it sounded entirely new and charming to the little Toad.\n\n\"I must get to Egypt!\" it said. \"If only the Stork would take me along, or if one of its youngsters would. I would do the little one some favor in turn, on his wedding day. Yes, I'll get to Egypt, because I'm lucky! All the longing and yearning I feel is surely better than having a jewel in one's head.\"\n\nAnd still it had the true jewel! That eternal longing and desire to go upward, ever upward, was the jewel, and it shone within the little Toad, shone with gladness, shone brightly.\n\nAt that very moment the Stork came. He had seen the Toad in the grass, and now he swooped down and, not very gently, siezed the little creature. His bill pinched, and the wind whistled; this was anything but comfortable. But still the Toad was going upward, and off to Egypt, it knew; therefore its eyes brightened until it seemed as if a spark shot out from them.\n\n\"Croak! Oh!\"\n\nThe body was dead; the little Toad had been killed. But the spark from its eyes - what became of that?\n\nThe sunbeam caught it up and bore away the jewel from the head of the Toad. Where?\n\nYou should not ask the Naturalist; rather ask the Poet. He'll tell it to you as a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar will be in it, and the Stork family will have a part in it. Just think - the Caterpillar will be changed into a beautiful butterfly. The Stork family will fly over mountains and seas to faraway Africa and yet find the shortest way home again to the land of Denmark, to the same village, to the same roof! Yes, it's all almost too much like a fairy tale, and still it is true! You may well ask the Naturalist about that; he'll have to admit it; and yet you know it yourself, for you've witnessed it.\n\nBut the jewel in the head of the Toad? Look for it in the sun; look at it if you can.\n\nThe brightness is too great. We have not yet eyes that can look directly at all the glories God has created, but someday we shall have them, and that will be the most beautiful fairy tale of all, for we ourselves shall have a part in it."

      "body": "Gift of Love:\n\n“Can I see my baby?” the happy new mother asked. When the bundle was nestled in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she gasped. The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. \n\nThe baby had been born without ears. Time proved that the baby’s hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was marred. When he rushed home from school one day and flung himself into his mother’s arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be a succession of heartbreaks. He blurted out the tragedy. “A boy, a big boy … called me a freak.”\n\nHe grew up, handsome for his misfortune. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. “But you might mingle with other young people,” his mother reproved him, but felt a kindness in her heart. The boy’s father had a session with the family physician. Could nothing be done? “I believe I could graft on a pair of outer ears, if they could be procured,” the doctor decided.\n\n Whereupon the search began for a person who would make such a sacrifice for a young man. Two years went by. Then, “You are going to the hospital, Son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it’s a secret,” said the father. The operation was a brilliant success, and a new person emerged. His talents blossomed into genius, and school and college became a series of triumphs. Later he married and entered the diplomatic service.\n\n “But I must know!” He urged his father, “Who gave so much for me? I could never do enough for him.” “I do not believe you could,” said the father, “but the agreement was that you are not to know … not yet.” The years kept their profound secret, but the day did come … \n\none of the darkest days that a son must endure. He stood with his father over his mother’s casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish-brown hair to reveal that the mother had no outer ears. \n\n“Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,” he whispered gently, “and nobody ever thought Mother less beautiful, did they?” Real beauty lies not in the physical appearance, but in the heart. Real treasure lies not in what that can be seen, but what that cannot be seen. Real love lies not in what is done and known, but in what that is done but not known."

Preparations were made for many days, and finally. they were all ready.\n\nFor the first stage of their journey, the friends had to cross a river. A boatman took them across a river. They were excited for their trip and on crossing the river, they thanked the boatman and continued their journey. There was much laughter, as they went from city to city. The men saw many strange sights, some of which they had never seen before.\n\nAt last, it was time to return home. After many more days of travel, the twelve weavers came back to the rive. They looked up and down, but neither the boatman nor his boat could be seen anywhere. “What shall we do?” asked one of the weavers. “Let us wait for the boatman,” said another. “Oh, no! I’m eager to see my family again. Let’s swim across,” said the third one. “But one of us might drown,” cried another.\n\n“Yes, let’s wait!” cautioned one of the men. The boatman will surely bring someone from the other side. Then we can return in the same boat.” “I can’t wait,” exclaimed one fellow. “I’ve got so many things to show. We are so close to home. Let’s swim across. We’ve traveled so far together, I’m sure we’ll be able to swim across.”\n\nThey argued in this manner for a while till finally all twelve were convinced that no harm would come to them if they swam across. “The river isn’t so deep. We’ve to wade for most of the way,” they said and set off their bags on their heads.\n\nWhen they reached the other side, one of the weavers said, “Let’s make sure that all twelve of us have crossed the river. All of you must stand in a line while I count.” The others quickly fell into line and the first one began to count. “One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven… Oh my god! One of us is missing!”\n\nSoon each one of them had taken a turn at counting the members of the group and they were sure that one of them had drowned in the river. The group continued on their way and soon reached their town. They were crying loudly, bemoaning the loss of their friend when they met one of the towns people. “What’s the matter? Why do you weep so loudly?” he asked.\n\n“We were twelve happy men when we left this town, but now we’re only eleven. We lost a friend on the last stretch of our journey. He drowned as we crossed the river,” said the weeping men as they began to cry loudly once again. By this time, a crowd had gathered around the men. “It’s impossible,” cried the crowd. “Most of the river is so shallow that you can wade across easily. How can anybody drown?”\n\nAt once, one of the townsmen came forward. “You’ve been very foolish! I’ll show you that none of you has drowned.” So saying, he went upto the first man, gave him a resounding slap and shouted ‘ONE’! Then he went to the second fellow, repeated his actions, and called out ‘TWO’! In this way, he walked from one weaver to the next, smacking them hard as he counted: “THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, ELEVEN, TWELVE!” All of you counted but not one of you counted yourself!\n\n“Haha, What foolish fellows! You’ve gone around the world, seen so much, but don’t seem to have come back any wiser,” laughed the townspeople. “Once a fool, always a fool!” they said and went back to their work, chuckling loud and long.\n\nThe twelve weavers too, returned to their homes, glad that they were all safe but wishing that they had not made such fools of themselves."

      "body": "Old Mother Goose and Her Son Jack:\n\nOld Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack. Jack was a very good lad, and although he was not handsome, he was good-tempered and industrious, and this made him better-looking than half the other boys. Old Mother Goose carried a long stick, she wore a high-crowned hat, and high-heeled shoes, and her kerchief was as white as snow. Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond, and the Owl that sat on the wall. So you see they formed a very happy family. But what a fine strong fellow the Gander was! Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted to take a journey, she would mount upon his broad strong back, and away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance.\n\nNow Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely; so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could find. It was early in the morning when he started, and his way lay through a wood. He was not afraid of robbers; so on he went, with his Mother's great clothes-prop over his shoulder. The fresh morning air caused Jack's spirits to rise. He left the road, and plunged into the thick of the wood, where he amused himself by leaping with his clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself. After he had made many attempts to find the path again, he heard a scream. He jumped up and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came. Through an opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle. With one heavy blow of his staff Jack sent the thief howling away, and then went back to the young lady, who was lying on the ground, crying.\n\nShe soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off, and thanked Jack for his help. The young lady told Jack that she was the daughter of the Squire, who lived in the great white house on the hill-top. She knew the path out of the wood quite well, and when they reached the border, she said that Jack must come soon to her father's house, so that he might thank him for his noble conduct.\n\nWhen Jack was left alone, he made the best of his way to the market-place. He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose, for when he got there he was very late, and there was but one left. But as it was a prime one, Jack bought it at once, and keeping to the road, made straight for home. At first the Goose objected to be carried; and then, when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a short time, she tried to fly away; so Jack seized her in his arms and kept her there till he reached home.\n\nOld Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird Jack had bought; and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe. And then they all lived very happily for a long time. But Jack would often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had rescued in the forest, and soon began to sigh all day long. He neglected the garden, cared no more for the Gander, and scarcely even noticed the beautiful Goose. But one morning, as he was walking by the pond, he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise, as though they were in the utmost glee. He went up to them and was surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg. He ran with it to his mother, who said, “Go to market, my son; sell your egg, and you will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire.” So to market Jack went, and sold his golden egg; but the rogue who bought it of him cheated him out of half his due. Then he dressed himself in his finest clothes, and went up to the Squire's house. Two footmen stood at the door, one looking very stout and saucy, and the other sleepy and stupid.\n\nWhen Jack asked to see the Squire, they laughed at him, and made sport of his fine clothes; but Jack had wit enough to offer them each a guinea, when they at once showed him to the Squire's room.\n\nNow the Squire, who was very rich, was also very proud and fat, and scarcely turned his head to notice Jack; but when he showed him his bag of gold, and asked for his daughter to be his bride, the Squire flew into a rage, and ordered his servants to throw him into the horse-pond. But this was not so easy to do, for Jack was strong and active; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever, and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. And well did his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she would lay him a golden egg, and Jack, grown wiser, would no longer sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself. His wealth became known to all the country round, and the Squire at length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law. Then Old Mother Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander, leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride, who lived happily ever afterwards."

      "body": "Aunty Toothache:\n\nAunty gave me sweets when I was little. My teeth could stand it then; it didn't hurt them. Now I am older, am a student, and still she goes on spoiling me with sweets. She says I am a poet.\n\nI have something of the poet in me, but not enough. Often when I go walking along the city streets, it seems to me as if I am walking in a big library; the houses are the bookshelves; and every floor is a shelf with books. There stands a story of everyday life; next to it is a good old comedy, and there are works of all scientific branches, bad literature and good reading. I can dream and philosophize among all this literature.\n\nThere is something of the poet in me, but not enough. No doubt many people have just as much of it in them as I, though they do not carry a sign or a necktie with the word \"Poet\" on it. They and I have been given a divine gift, a blessing great enough to satisfy oneself, but altogether too little to be portioned out again to others. It comes like a ray of sunlight and fills one's soul and thoughts; it comes like the fragrance of a flower, like a melody that one knows and yet cannot remember from where.\n\nThe other evening I sat in my room and felt an urge to read, but I had no book, no paper. Just then a leaf, fresh and green, fell from the lime tree, and the breeze carried it in through the window to me. I examined the many veins in it; a little insect was crawling across them, as if it were making a thorough study of the leaf. This made me think of man's wisdom: we also crawl about on a leaf; our knowledge is limited to that only, and yet we unhesitatingly deliver a lecture on the whole big tree - the root, the trunk, and the crown - the great tree comprised of God, the world, and immortality - and of all this we know only a little leaf!\n\nAs I was sitting there, I received a visit from Aunty Mille. I showed her the leaf with the insect and told her of my thoughts in connection with these. And her eyes lit up.\n\n\"You are a poet!\" she said. \"Perhaps the greatest we have. If I should live to see this, I would go to my grave gladly. Ever since the brewer Rasmussen's funeral you have amazed me with your powerful imagination.\"\n\nSo said Aunty Mille, and she then kissed me.\n\nWho was Aunty Mille, and who was Rasmussen the brewer?\n\nII\n\nWe children always called our mother's aunt \"Aunty\"; we had no other name for her.\n\nShe gave us jam and sweets, although they were very injurious to our teeth; but the dear children were her weakness, she said. It was cruel to deny them a few sweets, when they were so fond of them. And that's why we loved Aunty so much.\n\nShe was an old maid; as far back as I can remember, she was always old. Her age never seemed to change.\n\nIn earlier years she had suffered a great deal from toothache, and she always spoke about it; and so it happened that her friend, the brewer Rasmussen, who was a great wit, called her Aunty Toothache.\n\nHe had retired from the brewing business some years before and was then living on the interest of his money. He frequently visited Aunty; he was older than she. He had no teeth at all - only a few black stumps. When a child, he had eaten too much sugar, he told us children, and that's how he came to look as he did.\n\nAunty could surely never have eaten sugar in her childhood, for she had the most beautiful white teeth. She took great care of them, and she did not sleep with them at night! - said Rasmussen the brewer. We children knew that this was said in malice, but Aunty said he did not mean anything by it.\n\nOne morning, at the breakfast table, she told us of a terrible dream she had had during the night, in which one of her teeth had fallen out.\n\n\"That means,\" she said, \"that I shall lose a true friend!\"\n\n\"Was it a false tooth?\" asked the brewer with a chuckle. \"If so, it can only mean that you will lose a false friend!\"\n\n\"You are an insolent old man!\" said Aunty, angrier than I had seen her before or ever have since.\n\nShe later told us that her old friend had only been teasing her; he was the finest man on earth, and when he died he would become one of God's little angels in heaven.\n\nI thought a good deal of this transformation, and wondered if I would be able to recognize him in this new character.\n\nWhen Aunty and he had been young, he had proposed to her. She had settled down to think it over, had thought too long, and had become an old maid, but always remained his true friend.\n\nAnd then Brewer Rasmussen died. He was taken to his grave in the most expensive hearse and was followed by a great number of folks, including people with orders and in uniform.\n\nAunty stood dressed in mourning by the window, together with all of us children, except our little brother, whom the stork had brought a week before. When the hearse and the procession had passed and the street was empty, Aunty wanted to go away from the window, but I did not want to; I was waiting for the angel, Rasmussen the brewer; surely he had by now become one of God's bewinged little children and would appear.\n\n\"Aunty,\" I said, \"don't you think that he will come now? Or that when the stork again brings us a little brother, he'll then bring us the angel Rasmussen?\"\n\nAunty was quite overwhelmed by my imagination, and said, \"That child will become a great poet!\" And this she kept repeating all the time I went to school, and even after my confirmation and, yes, still does now that I am a student.\n\nShe was, and is, to me the most sympathetic of friends, both in my poetical troubles and dental troubles, for I have attacks of both.\n\n\"Just write down all your thoughts,\" she said, \"and put them in the table drawer! That's what Jean Paul did; he became a great poet, though I don't admire him; he does not excite one. You must be exciting! Yes, you will be exciting!\"\n\nThe night after she said this, I lay awake, full of longings and anguish, with anxiety and fond hopes to become the great poet that Aunty saw and perceived in me; I went through all the pains of a poet! But there is an even greater pain - toothache - and it was grinding and crushing me; I became a writhing worm, with a bag of herbs and a mustard plaster.\n\n\"I know all about it, \" said Aunty. There was a sorrowful smile on her lips, and her white teeth glistened.\n\nBut I must begin a new chapter in my own and my aunt's story.\n\nIII\n\nI had moved to a new flat and had been living there a month. I was telling Aunty about it.\n\n\" I live with a quiet family; they pay no attention to me, even if I ring three times. Besides, it is a noisy house, full of sounds and disturbances caused by the weather, the wind, and the people. I live just above the street gate; every carriage that drives out or in makes the pictures on the walls move about. The gate bangs and shakes the house as if there were an earthquake. If I am in bed, the shocks go right through all my limbs, but that is said to be strengthening to the nerves. If the wind blows, and it is always blowing in this country, the long window hooks outside swing to and fro, and strike against the wall. The bell on the gate to the neighbor's yard rings with every gust of wind.\n\n\"The people who live in the house come home at all hours, from late in the evening until far into the night; the lodger just above me, who in the daytime gives lessons on the trombone, comes home the latest and does not go to bed before he has taken a little midnight promenade with heavy steps and in iron heeled shoes.\n\n\"There are no double windows. There is a broken pane in my room, over which the landlady has pasted some paper, but the wind blows through the crack despite that and produces a sound similar to that of a buzzing wasp. It is like the sort of music that makes one go to sleep. If at last I fall asleep, I am soon awakened by the crowing of the cocks. From the cellarman's hencoop the cocks and hens announce that it will soon be morning. The small ponies, which have no stable, but are tied up in the storeroom under the staircase, kick against the door and the paneling as they move about.\n\n\"The day dawns. The porter, who lives with his family in the attic, comes thundering down the stairs; his wooden shoes clatter; the gate bangs and the house shakes. And when all this is over, the lodger above begins to occupy himself with gymnastic exercises; he lifts a heavy iron ball in each hand, but he is not able to hold onto them, and they are continually falling on the floor, while at the same time the young folks in the house, who are going to school, come screaming with all their might. I go to the window and open it to get some fresh air, and it is most refreshing - when I can get it, and when the young woman in the back building is not washing gloves in soapsuds, by which she earns her livelihood. Otherwise it is a pleasant house, and I live with a quiet family!\"\n\nThis was the report I gave Aunty about my flat, though it was livelier at the time, for the spoken word has a fresher sound than the written.\n\n\"You are a poet!\" cried Aunty. \"Just write down all you have said, and you will be as good as Dickens! Indeed, to me, you are much more interesting. You paint when you speak. You describe your house so that one can see it. It makes one shudder. Go on with your poetry. Put some living beings into it - people, charming people, especially unhappy ones.\"\n\nI wrote down my description of the house as it stands, with all its sounds, its noises, but included only myself. There was no plot in it. That came later.\n\nIV\n\nIt was during wintertime, late at night, after theater hours; it was terrible weather; a snowstorm raged so that one could hardly move along.\n\nAunty had gone to the theater, and I went there to take her home; it was difficult for one to get anywhere, to say nothing of helping another. All the hiring carriages were engaged. Aunty lived in a distant section of the town, while my dwelling was close to the theater. Had this not been the case, we would have had to take refuge in a sentry box for a while.\n\nWe trudged along in the deep snow while the snowflakes whirled around us. I had to lift her, hold onto her, and push her along. Only twice did we fall, but we fell on the soft snow.\n\nWe reached my gate, where we shook some of the snow from ourselves. On the stairs, too, we shook some off, and yet there was still enough almost to cover the floor of the anteroom.\n\nWe took off our overcoats and boots and what other clothes might be removed. The landlady lent Aunty dry stockings and a nightcap; this she would need, said the landlady, and added that it would be impossible for my aunt to get home that night, which was true. Then she asked Aunty to make use of her parlor, where she would prepare a bed for her on the sofa, in front of the door that led into my room and that was always kept locked. And so she stayed.\n\nThe fire burned in my stove, the tea urn was placed on the table, and the little room became cozy, if not as cozy as Aunty's own room, where in the wintertime there are heavy curtains before the door, heavy curtains before the windows, and double carpets on the floor, with three layers of thick paper underneath. One sits there as if in a well-corked bottle, full of warm air; still, as I have said, it was also cozy at my place, while outside the wind was whistling.\n\nAunty talked and reminisced; she recalled the days of her youth; the brewer came back; many old memories were revived.\n\nShe could remember the time I got my first tooth, and the family's delight over it. My first tooth! The tooth of innocence, shining like a little drop of milk - the milk tooth!\n\nWhen one had come, several more came, a whole rank of them, side by side, appearing both above and below - the finest of children's teeth, though these were only the \"vanguard,\" not the real teeth, which have to last one's whole lifetime.\n\nThen those also appeared, and the wisdom teeth as well, the flank men of each rank, born in pain and great tribulation.\n\nThey disappear, too, sometimes every one of them; they disappear before their time of service is up, and when the very last one goes, that is far from a happy day; it is a day for mourning. And so then one considers himself old, even if he feels young.\n\nSuch thoughts and talk are not pleasant. Yet we came to talk about all this; we went back to the days of my childhood and talked and talked. It was twelve o'clock before Aunty went to rest in the room near by.\n\n\"Good night, my sweet child,\" she called. \"I shall now sleep as if I were in my own bed.\"\n\nAnd she slept peacefully; but otherwise there was no peace either in the house or outside. The storm rattled the windows, struck the long, dangling iron hooks against the house, and rang the neighbor's back-yard bell. The lodger upstairs had come home. He was still taking his little nightly tour up and down the room; he then kicked off his boots and went to bed and to sleep; but he snores so that anyone with good ears can hear him through the ceiling.\n\nI found no rest, no peace. The weather did not rest, either; it was lively. The wind howled and sang in its own way; my teeth also began to be lively, and they hummed and sang in their way. An awful toothache was coming on.\n\nThere was a draft from the window. The moon shone in upon the floor; the light came and went as the clouds came and went in the stormy weather. There was a restless change of light and shadow, but at last the shadow on the floor began to take shape. I stared at the moving form and felt an icy-cold wind against my face.\n\nOn the floor sat a figure, thin and long, like something a child would draw with a pencil on a slate, something supposed to look like a person, a single thin line forming the body, another two lines the arms, each leg being but a single line, and the head having a polygonal shape.\n\nThe figure soon became more distinct; it had a very thin, very fine sort of cloth draped around it, clearly showing that the figure was that of a female.\n\nI heard a buzzing sound. Was it she or the wind which was buzzing like a hornet through the crack in the pane?\n\nNo, it was she, Madam Toothache herself! Her terrible highness, Satania Infernalis! God deliver and preserve us from her!\n\n\"It is good to be here!\" she buzzed. \"These are nice quarters - mossy ground, fenny ground! Gnats have been buzzing around here, with poison in their stings; and now I am here with such a sting. It must be sharpened on human teeth. Those belonging to the fellow in bed here shine so brightly. They have defied sweet and sour things, heat and cold, nutshells and plum stones; but I shall shake them, make them quake, feed their roots with drafty winds, and give them cold feet!\"\n\nThat was a frightening speech! She was a terrible visitor!\n\n\"So you are a poet!\" she said. \"Well, I'll make you well versed in all the poetry of toothache! I'll thrust iron and steel into your body! I'll seize all the fibers of your nerves!\"\n\nI then felt as if a red-hot awl were being driven into my jawbone; I writhed and twisted.\n\n\"A splendid set of teeth,\" she said, \"just like an organ to play upon! We shall have a grand concert, with jew's-harps, kettledrums, and trumpets, piccolo-flute, and a trombone in the wisdom tooth! Grand poet, grand music!\"\n\nAnd then she started to play; she looked terrible, even if one did not see more of her than her hand, the shadowy, gray, icecold hand, with the long, thin, pointed fingers; each of them was an instrument of torture; the thumb and the forefinger were the pincers and wrench; the middle finger ended in a pointed awl; the ring finger was a drill, and the little finger squirted gnat's poison.\n\n\"I am going to teach you meter!\" she said. \"A great poet must have a great toothache, a little poet a little toothache!\"\n\n\"Oh, let me be a little poet!\" I begged. \"Let me be nothing at all! And I am not a poet; I have only fits of poetry, like fits of toothache. Go away, go away!\"\n\n\"Will you acknowledge, then, that I am mightier than poetry, philosophy, mathematics, and all the music?\" she said. \"Mightier than all those notions that are painted on canvas or carved in marble? I am older than every one of them. I was born close to the garden of paradise, just outside, where the wind blew and the wet toadstools grew. It was I who made Eve wear clothes in the cold weather, and Adam also. Believe me, there was power in the first toothache!\"\n\n\"I believe it all,\" I said. \"But go away, go away!\"\n\n\"Yes, if you will give up being a poet, never put verse on paper, slate, or any sort of writing material, then I will let you off; but I'll come again if you write poetry!\"\n\n\"I swear!\" I said; \"only let me never see or feel you any more!\"\n\n\"See me you shall, but in a more substantial shape, in a shape more dear to you than I am now. You shall see me as Aunty Mille, and I shall say, 'Write poetry, my sweet boy! You are a great poet, perhaps the greatest we have!' But if you believe me, and begin to write poetry, then I will set music to your verses, and play them on your mouth harp. You sweet child! Remember me when you see Aunty Mille!\"\n\nThen she disappeared.\n\nAt our parting I received a thrust through my jawbone like that of a red-hot awl; but it soon subsided, and then I felt as if I were gliding along the smooth water; I saw the white water lilies, with their large green leaves, bending and sinking down under me; they withered and dissolved, and I sank, too, and dissolved into peace and rest.\n\n\"To die, and melt away like snow!\" resounded in the water; \"to evaporate into air, to drift away like the clouds!\"\n\nGreat, glowing names and inscriptions on waving banners of victory, the letters patent of immortality, written on the wing of an ephemera, shone down to me through the water.\n\nThe sleep was deep, a sleep now without dreams. I did not hear the whistling wind, the banging gate, the ringing of the neighbor's gate bell, or the lodger's strenuous gymnastics.\n\nWhat happiness!\n\nThen came a gust of wind so strong that the locked door to Aunty's room burst open. Aunty jumped up, put on her shoes, got dressed, and came into my room. I was sleeping like one of God's angels, she said, and she had not the heart to awaken me.\n\nI later awoke by myself and opened my eyes. I had completely forgotten that Aunty was in the house, but I soon remembered it and then remembered my toothache vision. Dream and reality were blended.\n\n\"I suppose you did not write anything last night after we said good night?\" she said. \"I wish you had; you are my poet and shall always be!\"\n\nIt seemed to me that she smiled rather slyly. I did not know if it was the kindly Aunty Mille, who loved me, or the terrible one to whom I had made the promise the night before.\n\n\"Have you written any poetry, sweet child?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" I shouted. \"You are Aunty Mille, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Who else?\" she said. And it was Aunty Mille.\n\nShe kissed me, got into a carriage, and drove home.\n\nI wrote down what is written here. It is not in verse, and it will never be printed.\n\nYes, here ended the manuscript.\n\nMy young friend, the grocer's assistant, could not find the missing sheets; they had gone out into the world like the papers around the salted herring, the butter, and the green soap; they had fulfilled their destiny!\n\nThe brewer is dead; Aunty is dead; the student is dead, he whose sparks of genius went into the basket. This is the end of the story - the story of Aunty Toothache."

Not quite sure how to approach her, he called the family Doctor to discuss the problem. The Doctor told him there is a simple informal test the husband could perform to give the Doctor a better idea about her hearing loss. \n\n Here’s what you do,” said the Doctor, “stand about 40 feet away from her, and in a normal conversational speaking tone see if she hears you. If not, go to 30 feet, then 20 feet, and s o on until you get a response.” \n\n That evening, the wife is in the kitchen cooking dinner, and he was in the den. He says to himself, “I’m about 40 feet away, let’s see what happens.” Then in a normal tone he asks, ‘Honey, what’s for dinner?” No response. \n\n So the husband moves to closer to the kitchen, about 30 feet from his wife and repeats, “Honey, what’s for dinner?” Still no response. \n\n Next he moves into the dining room where he is about 20 feet from his wife and asks, Honey, what’s for dinner?” \n Again he gets no response so, He walks up to the kitchen door, about 10 feet away. “Honey, what’s for dinner?” Again there is no response. \n\n So he walks right up behind her. “Honey, what’s for dinner?” \n “James, for the FIFTH time I’ve said, CHICKEN!”\n\n Moral: The problem may not be with the other one as we always think, could be very much within us..!"

      "body": "The Shadow:\n\nIt is in the hot countries that the sun burns down in earnest, turning the people there a deep mahogany-brown. In the hottest countries of all they are seared into negroes, but it was not quite that hot in this country to which a man of learning had come from the colder north. He expected to go about there just as he had at home, but he soon discovered that this was a mistake. He and other sensible souls had to stay inside. The shutters were drawn and the doors were closed all day long. It looked just as if everyone were asleep or away from home. The narrow street of high houses where he lived was so situated that from morning till night the sun beat down on it - unbearably!\n\nTo this young and clever scholar from the colder north, it felt as if he were sitting in a blazing hot oven. It exhausted him so that he became very thin, and even his shadow shrank much smaller than it had been at home. Only in the evenings, after sundown, did the man and his shadow begin to recover.\n\nThis was really a joy to see. As soon as a candle was brought into the room, the shadow had to stretch itself to get its strength back. It stretched up to the wall, yes, even along the ceiling, so tall did it grow. To stretch himself, the scholar went out on the balcony. As soon as the stars came out in the beautifully clear sky, he felt as if he had come back to life.\n\nIn warm countries each window has a balcony, and in all the balconies up and down the street people came out to breathe the fresh air that one needs, even if one is already a fine mahogany-brown. Both up above and down below, things became lively. Tailors, shoemakers - everybody - moved out in the street. Chairs and tables were brought out, and candles were lighted, yes, candles by the thousand. One man talked, another sang, people strolled about, carriages drove by, and donkeys trotted along, ting-a-ling-a-ling, for their harness had bells on it. There were church bells ringing, hymn singing, and funeral processions. There were boys in the street firing off Roman candles. Oh yes, it was lively as lively can be down in that street.\n\nOnly one house was quiet - the one directly across from where the scholarly stranger lived. Yet someone lived there, for flowers on the balcony grew and thrived under that hot sun, which they could not have done unless they were watered. So someone must be watering them, and there must be people in the house. Along in the evening, as a matter of fact, the door across the street was opened. But it was dark inside, at least in the front room. From somewhere in the house, farther back, came the sound of music. The scholarly stranger thought the music was marvelous, but it is quite possible that he only imagined this, for out there in the warm countries he thought everything was marvelous - except the sun. The stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had rented the house across the street. No one was ever to be seen over there, and as for the music, he found it extremely tiresome. He said:\n\n\"It's just as if somebody sits there practicing a piece that's beyond him - always the selfsame piece. 'I'll play it right yet,' he probably says, but he doesn't, no matter how long he tries.\"\n\nOne night the stranger woke up. He slept with the windows to his balcony open, and as the breeze blew his curtain aside he fancied that a marvelous radiance came from the balcony across the street. The colors of all the flowers were as brilliant as flames. In their midst stood a maiden, slender and lovely. It seemed as if a radiance came from her too. It actually hurt his eyes, but that was because he had opened them too wide in his sudden awakening.\n\nOne leap, and he was out of bed. Without a sound, he looked out through his curtains, but the maiden was gone. The flowers were no longer radiant, though they bloomed as fresh and fair as usual. The door was ajar and through it came music so lovely and soft that one could really feel very romantic about it. It was like magic. But who lived there? What entrance did they use? Facing the street, the lower floor of the house was a row of shops, and people couldn't run through them all the time.\n\nOn another evening, the stranger sat out on his balcony. The candle burned in the room behind him, so naturally his shadow was cast on the wall across the street. Yes, there it sat among the flowers, and when the stranger moved, it moved with him.\n\n\"I believe my shadow is the only living thing to be seen over there,\" the scholar thought to himself. \"See how he makes himself at home among the flowers. The door stands ajar, and if my shadow were clever he'd step in, have a look around, and come back to tell me what he had seen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said as a joke, \"you ought to make yourself useful. Kindly step inside. Well, aren't you going?\" He nodded to the shadow, and the shadow nodded back. \"Run along now, but be sure to come back.\"\n\nThe stranger rose, and his shadow across the street rose with him. The stranger turned around, and his shadow turned too. If anyone had been watching closely, he would have seen the shadow enter the half-open balcony door in the house across the way at the same instant that the stranger returned to his room and the curtain fell behind him.\n\nNext morning, when the scholar went out to take his coffee and read the newspapers, he said, \"What's this?\" as he came out in the sunshine. \"I haven't any shadow! So it really did go away last night, and it stayed away. Isn't that annoying?\"\n\nWhat annoyed him most was not so much the loss of his shadow, but the knowledge that there was already a story about a man without a shadow. All the people at home knew that story. If he went back and told them his story they would say he was just imitating the old one. He did not care to be called unoriginal, so he decided to say nothing about it, which was the most sensible thing to do.\n\nThat evening he again went out on the balcony. He had placed the candle directly behind him, because he knew that a shadow always likes to use its master as a screen, but he could not coax it forth. He made himself short and he made himself tall, but there was no shadow. It didn't come forth. He hemmed and he hawed, but it was no use.\n\nThis was very vexing, but in the hot countries everything grows most rapidly, and in a week or so he noticed with great satisfaction that when he went out in the sunshine a new shadow was growing at his feet. The root must have been left with him. In three weeks' time he had a very presentable shadow, and as he started north again it grew longer and longer, until it got so long and large that half of it would have been quite sufficient.\n\nThe learned man went home and wrote books about those things in the world that are true, that are good, and that are beautiful.\n\nThe days went by and the years went past, many, many years in fact. Then one evening when he was sitting in his room he heard a soft tapping at his door. \"Come in,\" said he, but no one came in. He opened the door and was confronted by a man so extremely thin that it gave him a strange feeling. However, the man was faultlessly dressed, and looked like a person of distinction.\n\n\"With whom do I have the honor of speaking?\" the scholar asked.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the distinguished visitor, \"I thought you wouldn't recognize me, now that I've put real flesh on my body and wear clothes. I don't suppose you ever expected to see me in such fine condition. Don't you know your old shadow? You must have thought I'd never come back. Things have gone remarkably well with me since I was last with you. I've thrived in every way, and if I have to buy my freedom, I can.\" He rattled a bunch of valuable charms that hung from his watch, and fingered the massive gold chain he wore around his neck. Ho! how his fingers flashed with diamond rings - and all this jewelry was real.\n\n\"No, I can't get over it!\" said the scholar. \"What does it all mean?\"\n\n\"Nothing ordinary, you may be sure,\" said the shadow. \"But you are no ordinary person and I, as you know, have followed in your footsteps from childhood. As soon as you thought me sufficiently experienced to strike out in the world for myself, I went my way. I have been immeasurably successful. But I felt a sort of longing to see you again before you die, as I suppose you must, and I wanted to see this country again. You know how one loves his native land. I know that you have got hold of another shadow. Do I owe anything to either of you? Be kind enough to let me know.\"\n\n\"Well! Is it really you?\" said the scholar. \"Why, this is most extraordinary! I would never have imagined that one's own shadow could come back in human form.\"\n\n\"Just tell me what I owe,\" said the shadow, \"because I don't like to be in debt to anyone.\"\n\n\"How can you talk that way? said the student. \"What debt could there be? Feel perfectly free. I am tremendously pleased to hear of your good luck! Sit down, my old friend, and tell me a bit about how it all happened, and about what you saw in that house across the street from us in the warm country.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll tell you all about it,\" the shadow said, as he sat down. \"But you must promise that if you meet me anywhere you won't tell a soul in town about my having been your shadow. I intend to become engaged, for I can easily support a family.\"\n\n\"Don't you worry,\" said the scholar. \"I won't tell anyone who you really are. I give you my hand on it. I promise, and a man is as good as his word.\"\n\n\"And a word is as good as its - shadow,\" the shadow said, for he couldn't put it any other way.\n\nIt was really remarkable how much of a man he had become, dressed all in black, with the finest cloth, patent-leather shoes, and an opera hat that could be pressed perfectly flat till it was only brim and top, not to mention those things we already know about - those seals, that gold chain, and the diamond rings. The shadow was well dressed indeed, and it was just this that made him appear human.\n\n\"Now I'll tell you,\" said the shadow, grinding his patent-leather shoes on the arm of the scholar's new shadow, which lay at his feet like a\n\npoodle dog. This was arrogance, perhaps, or possibly he was trying to make the new shadow stick to his own feet. The shadow on the floor lay quiet and still, and listened its best, so that it might learn how to get free and work its way up to be its own master.\n\n\"Do you know who lived in the house across the street from us?\" the old shadow asked. \"She was the most lovely of all creatures - she was Poetry herself. I lived there for three weeks, and it was as if I had lived there three thousand years, reading all that has ever been written. That's what I said, and it's the truth! I have seen it all, and I know everything.\"\n\n\"Poetry!\" the scholar cried. \"Yes, to be sure she often lives as a hermit in the large cities. Poetry! Yes, I saw her myself, for one brief moment, but my eyes were heavy with sleep. She stood on the balcony, as radiant as the northern lights. Tell me! Tell me! You were on the balcony. You went through the doorway, and then - \"\n\n\"Then I was in the anteroom,\" said the shadow. \"It was the room you were always staring at from across the way. There were no candles there, and the room was in twilight. But the door upon door stood open in a whole series of brilliantly lit halls and reception rooms. That blaze of lights would have struck me dead had I gone as far as the room where the maiden was, but I was careful - I took my time, as one should.\"\n\n\"And then what did you see, my old friend?\" the scholar asked.\n\n\"I saw everything, and I shall tell everything to you, but - it's not that I'm proud - but as I am a free man and well educated, not to mention my high standing and my considerable fortune, I do wish you wouldn't call me your old friend.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon!\" said the scholar. \"It's an old habit, and hard to change. You are perfectly right, my dear sir, and I'll remember it. But now, my dear sir, tell me of all that you saw.\"\n\n\"All?\" said the shadow, \"for I saw it all, and I know everything.\"\n\n\"How did the innermost rooms look?\" the scholar asked. \"Was it like a green forest? Was it like a holy temple? Were the rooms like the starry skies seen from some high mountain?\"\n\n\"Everything was there,\" said the shadow. \"I didn't quite go inside. I stayed in the dark anteroom, but my place there was perfect. I saw everything, and I know everything. I have been in the antechamber at the court of Poetry.\"\n\n\"But what did you see? Did the gods of old march through the halls? Did the old heroes fight there? Did fair children play there and tell their dreams?\"\n\n\"I was there, I tell you, so you must understand that I saw all that\n\nthere was to be seen. Had you come over, it would not have made a man of you, as it did of me. Also, I learned to understand my inner self, what is born in me, and the relationship between me and Poetry. Yes, when I was with you I did not think of such things, but you must remember how wonderfully I always expanded at sunrise and sunset. And in the moonlight I almost seemed more real than you. Then I did not understand myself, but in that anteroom I came to know my true nature. I was a man! I came out completely changed. But you were no longer in the warm country. Being a man, I was ashamed to be seen as I was. I lacked shoes, clothes, and all the surface veneer which makes a man.\n\n\"I went into hiding - this is confidential, and you must not write it in any of your books. I went into hiding under the skirts of the cake-woman. Little she knew what she concealed. Not until evening did I venture out. I ran through the streets in the moonlight and stretched myself tall against the walls. It's such a pleasant way of scratching one's back. Up I ran and down I ran, peeping into the highest windows, into drawing rooms, and into garrets. I peered in where no one else could peer. I saw what no one else could see, or should see. Taken all in all, it's a wicked world. I would not care to be a man if it were not considered the fashionable thing to be. I saw the most incredible behavior among men and women, fathers and mothers, and among those 'perfectly darling' children. I saw what nobody knows but everybody would like to know, and that is what wickedness goes on next door. If I had written it in a newspaper, oh, how widely it would have been read! But instead I wrote to the people directly concerned, and there was the most terrible consternation in every town to which I came. They were so afraid of me, and yet so remarkably fond of me. The professors appointed me a professor, and the tailor made me new clothes - my wardrobe is most complete. The master of the mint coined new money for me, the women called me such a handsome man; and so I became the man I am. Now I must bid you good-by. Here's my card. I live on the sunny side of the street, and I am always at home on rainy days.\" The shadow took his leave.\n\n\"How extraordinary,\" said the scholar.\n\nThe days passed. The years went by. And the shadow called again. \"How goes it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Alack,\" said the scholar, \"I still write about the true, the good, and the beautiful, but nobody cares to read about such things. I feel quite despondent, for I take it deeply to heart.\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said the shadow. \"I am getting fat, as one should. You don't know the ways of the world, and that's why your health suffers. You ought to travel. I'm taking a trip this summer. Will you come with me? I'd like to have a traveling companion. Will you come along as my shadow? It would be a great pleasure to have you along, and I'll pay all the expenses.\"\n\n\"No, that's a bit too much,\" said the scholar.\n\n\"It depends on how you look at it,\" said the shadow. \"It will do you a lot of good to travel. Will you be my shadow? The trip won't cost you a thing.\"\n\n\"This has gone much too far!\" said the scholar.\n\n\"Well, that's the way the world goes,\" the shadow told him, \"and that's the way it will keep on going.\" And away he went.\n\nThe learned man was not at all well. Sorrow and trouble pursued him, and what he had to say about the good, the true, and the beautiful, appealed to most people about as much as roses appeal to a cow. Finally he grew quite ill.\n\n\"You really look like a shadow,\" people told him, and he trembled at the thought.\n\n\"You must visit a watering place,\" said the shadow, who came to see him again. \"There's no question about it. I'll take you with me, for old friendship's sake. I'll pay for the trip, and you can write about it, as well as doing your best to amuse me along the way. I need to go to a watering place too, because my beard isn't growing as it should. That's a sort of disease too, and one can't get along without a beard. Now do be reasonable and accept my proposal. We shall travel just like friends!\"\n\nSo off they started. The shadow was master now, and the master was the shadow. They drove together, rode together, and walked together, side by side, before or behind each other, according to the way the sun fell. The shadow was careful to take the place of the master, and the scholar didn't much care, for he had an innocent heart, besides being most affable and friendly.\n\nOne day he said to the shadow, \"As we are now fellow-travelers and have grown up together, shall we not call each other by our first names, the way good companions should? It is much more intimate.\"\n\n\"That's a splendid idea!\" said the shadow, who was now the real master. \"What you say is most open-hearted and friendly. I shall be just as friendly and open-hearted with you. As a scholar, you are perfectly well aware how strange is man's nature. Some men cannot bear the touch of gray paper. It sickens them. Others quail if they hear a nail scratched across a pane of glass. For my part, I am affected in just that way when I hear you call me by my first name. I feel myself ground down to the earth, as I was in my first position with you. You understand. It's a matter of sensitivity, not pride. I cannot let you call me by my first name, but I shall be glad to call you by yours, as a compromise.\" So thereafter the shadow called his one-time master by his first name.\n\n\"It has gone too far,\" the scholar thought, \"when I must call him by his last name while he calls me by my first!\" But he had to put up with it.\n\nAt last they came to the watering place. Among the many people was a lovely Princess. Her malady was that she saw things too clearly, which can be most upsetting. For instance, she immediately saw that the newcomer was a very different sort of person from all the others.\n\n\"He has come here to make his beard grow, they say. But I see the real reason. He can't cast a shadow.\"\n\nHer curiosity was aroused, and on the promenade she addressed this stranger directly. Being a king's daughter, she did not have to stand upon ceremony, so she said to him straight:\n\n\"Your trouble is that you can't cast a shadow.\"\n\n\"Your Royal Highness must have improved considerably,\" the shadow replied. \"I know your malady is that you see too clearly, but you are improving. As it happens, I do have a most unusual shadow. Don't you see that figure who always accompanies me? Other people have a common shadow, but I do not care for what is common to all. Just as we often allow our servants better fabrics for their liveries than we wear ourselves, so I have had my shadow decked out as a man. Why, you see I have even outfitted him with a shadow of his own. It is expensive, I grant you, but I like to have something uncommon.\"\n\n\"My!\" the Princess thought. \"Can I really be cured? This is the foremost watering place in the world, and in these days water has come to have wonderful medicinal powers. But I shan't leave just as the place is becoming amusing. I have taken a liking to this stranger. I only hope his beard won't grow, for then he would leave us.\"\n\nThat evening, the Princess and the shadow danced together in the great ballroom. She was light, but he was lighter still. Never had she danced with such a partner. She told him what country she came from, and he knew it well. He had been there, but it was during her absence. He had looked through every window, high or low. He had seen this and he had seen that. So he could answer the Princess and suggest things that astounded her. She was convinced that he must be the wisest man in all the world. His knowledge impressed her so deeply, that while they were dancing she fell in love with him. The shadow could tell, for her eyes transfixed him, through and through. They danced again, and she came very near telling him she loved him, but it wouldn't do to be rash. She had to think of her country, and her throne, and the many people over whom she would reign.\n\n\"He is a clever man,\" she said to herself, \"and that is a good thing. He dances charmingly, and that is good too. But is his knowledge more than superficial? That's just as important, so I must examine him.\"\n\nTactfully, she began asking him the most difficult questions, which she herself could not have answered. The shadow made a wry face.\n\n\"You can't answer me?\" said the Princess.\n\n\"I knew all that in my childhood,\" said the shadow. \"Why, I believe that my shadow over there by the door can answer you.\"\n\n\"Your shadow!\" said the Princess. \"That would be remarkable indeed!\"\n\n\"I can't say for certain,\" said the shadow, \"but I'm inclined to think so, because he has followed me about and listened to me for so many years. Yes, I am inclined to believe so. But your Royal Highness must permit me to tell you that he is quite proud of being able to pass for a man, so if he is to be in the right frame of mind to answer your questions he must be treated just as if he were human.\"\n\n\"I like that!\" said the Princess.\n\nSo she went to the scholar in the doorway, and spoke with him about the sun and the moon, and about people, what they are inside, and what they seem to be on the surface. He answered her wisely and well.\n\n\"What a man that must be, to have such a wise shadow!\" she thought. \"It will be a godsend to my people, and to my country if I choose him for my consort. That's just what I'll do!\"\n\nThe Princess and the shadow came to an understanding, but no one was to know about it until she returned to her own kingdom.\n\n\"No one. Not even my shadow!\" said the shadow. And he had his own private reason for this.\n\nFinally they came to the country that the Princess ruled when she was at home.\n\n\"Listen, my good friend,\" the shadow said the scholar, \"I am now as happy and strong as one can be, so I'll do something very special for you. You shall live with me in my palace, drive with me in my royal carriage, and have a hundred thousand dollars a year. However, you must let yourself be called a shadow by everybody. You must not ever say that you have been a man, and once a year, while I sit on the balcony in the sunshine, you must lie at my feet as shadows do. For I tell you I am going to marry the Princess, and the wedding is to take place this very evening.\"\n\n\"No! That's going too far,\" said the scholar. \"I will not. I won't do it. That would be betraying the whole country and the Princess too. I'll tell them everything - that I am the man, and you are the shadow merely dressed as a man.\"\n\n\"No one would believe it,\" said the shadow. \"Be reasonable, or I'll call the sentry.\"\n\n\"I'll go straight to the Princess,\" said the scholar.\n\n\"But I will go first,\" said the shadow, \"and you shall go to prison.\"\n\nAnd to prison he went, for the sentries obeyed the one who, they knew, was to marry the Princess.\n\n\"Why, you're trembling,\" the Princess said, as the shadow entered her room. \"What has happened? You mustn't fall ill this evening, just as we are about to be married.\"\n\n\"I have been through the most dreadful experience that could happen to anyone,\" said the shadow. \"Just imagine! Of course a poor shadow's head can't stand very much. But imagine! My shadow has gone mad. He takes himself for a man, and - imagine it! he takes me for his shadow.\"\n\n\"How terrible!\" said the Princess. \"He's locked up, I hope!\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. I'm afraid he will never recover.\"\n\n\"Poor shadow,\" said the Princess. \"He is very unhappy. It would really be a charitable act to relieve him of the little bit of life he has left. And, after thinking it over carefully, my opinion is that it will be necessary to put him out of the way.\"\n\n\"That's certainly hard, for he was a faithful servant,\" said the shadow. He managed to sigh.\n\n\"You have a noble soul,\" the Princess told him.\n\nThe whole city was brilliantly lit that evening. The cannons boomed, and the soldiers presented arms. That was the sort of wedding it was! The Princess and the shadow stepped out on the balcony to show themselves and be cheered, again and again.\n\nThe scholar heard nothing of all this, for they had already done away with him."

      "body": "Ahmed's Father Embarrassed Him:\n\nSomewhere below the clouds there is an island called the United Kingdom. In the south of this island there is a city called London. In the south of this city there is a small village. And in this village there lives an eleven year old boy called AHMED. No, no. His name is not Adam. It is 'AHMED'. That's right, there is an 'e' instead of an 'a' just before the last letter 'm'. AHMED is a Turkish name. Both Adam and AHMED mean 'the first man in the world.' \n\nAHMED is a curious boy who loves reading. He reads all kinds of story books. He also reads The Guinness Book of World Records. This is his favourite. The young boy loves to talk about the things he reads in his Book of Records. If AHMED were here now, he would already be talking about Sultan Kosen of Turkey who is eight feet and one inch tall. Sultan Kosen is the tallest living man in the Guinness Book of World Records! Hey look! Here is AHMED coming out from school with his two best friends, Ben and Jonathan. AHMED is the one with dark hair, olive skin and beautiful blue eyes. \n\nYou cannot miss him because Ben and Jonathan are both blonde boys with fair skin. AHMED's father is Turkish and his mother is English. He got his looks from his father, but his eyes are the same colour as his mother's. AHMED hears someone say 'Merhaba.' He turns around and waves at his Turkish friend, Metin. Then AHMED replies by saying, 'Merhaba!' This word means hello in Turkish. The first Turkish word AHMED ever learnt to say was 'Baba'. It means Dad. One day, when AHMED was a little boy, he asked his Baba, 'Am I English or Turkish, or am I half of each?' His Baba thought about this question for a moment, then answered, 'You are not half of anything, my son. You are both full Turkish and full English.' AHMED liked this answer very much. Sometime later, AHMED got his face painted with an English flag while he was at the carnival. When his Baba saw AHMED's face he was really quite shocked, but AHMED said, 'It is okay, Baba. Don't you remember, I am full English as well as full Turkish.' AHMED gives a high five to Ben and Jonathan and then approaches us and walks beside us along the pavement. He smiles up at us.\n\n 'Did you know that in June 2003 a Turkish man called Muhammed Rashid entered the Guinness Book of World Records with his moustache that was over five feet long! That is a very long moustache,' says AHMED, his smile becoming even bigger. 'My Baba has a big moustache too, and bushy eyebrows. But his moustache is not as big as five feet, thank Allah!' AHMED says 'Allah' instead of God, because AHMED is a Muslim boy. AHMED notices a man walking in the street with a dark blue velvet Kippah. 'A Kippah is a Jewish hat,' says AHMED, just so we know. Then the young boy notices a Sikh man wearing a traditional Turban. AHMED loves this variety of different cultures walking along the same street. \n\n'My Baba owns a restaurant,' AHMED tells us. He looks at us directly with his serious eyes, as if he is teaching us something very important. 'It is not a kebab restaurant. In my Baba's restaurant they make vegetarian stew and serve it with special bread called Pide bread. It is very tasty.' AHMED's Baba has a favourite food. It is called Okra. Okra is a vegetable that tastes a bit like a pickle. AHMED's Baba puts lemon on the Okra because he says it makes the vegetable taste extra special! 'I really like Kebab,' AHMED tells us. 'I know it is not very healthy, but it tastes really good.' Suddenly, the young boy looks a little uncomfortable, as if there is something he wants to tell us. He seems to concentrate, formulating the words inside his head. \n\n'Every Thursday,' he says after a moment's silence, 'my Baba comes and picks me up. I don't like Thursdays anymore. There is something about my Baba that embarrasses me. I want to talk to him about it, but I love him and don't want to hurt his feelings. It's not always easy to talk to parents, you know. For example, last Saturday after we had been swimming, I bought a really nice chocolate cake and my friend Ben and my Baba were with me in a café. I was eating my cake when my Baba whispers in my ear that I have to give some of my cake to my friend Ben. Baba said that this is a custom in Turkish culture. \n\nIt took me ages to whisper back and explain to my Baba that in English culture it is rude to offer my friend half eaten cake as I know he has some money in his pocket, and if he wanted to have some cake he would buy some for himself.' AHMED explains to us that his Baba has lived in England for a very long time, but he still does not have many English friends. The young boy says it is as if his father still lives as he used to live in Turkey.\n\n 'That is okay,' AHMED tells us, 'but it is sometimes difficult for me to understand some of the Turkish traditions, and there are so many of them to remember.' AHMED has almost arrived at the meeting point where his Baba has told him to wait to be picked up after school. Today is a Thursday. He looks a little bit nervous as he scans the street. 'I have tried to do something about this embarrassment,' he informs us earnestly, 'but it has not worked yet. I do not know how to talk to my Baba about the way he acts when we are with my friends.' AHMED stops on the corner. He still looks a bit nervous. 'This is where my Baba picks me up,' he says. \n\nThere are lots of children from AHMED's school standing about on the corner: some waiting to be picked up by their parents, some heading for the bus or walking home in pairs. AHMED pretends to read his book. He doesn't want any of his friends to be near him when his Baba picks him up. This is when AHMED notices Emily. Emily is beautiful. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and AHMED has fancied her ever since they were both in year five. One day, AHMED's history teacher placed all of the children in pairs for a school project. AHMED was placed with Emily. \n\nThe children had to make a Motte and Bailey castle. The best castle would win a prize. So AHMED and Emily spent a lot of time together and worked really hard on their castle. Then, when the judging day came, THEY WON! And that's when the fancying began, because Emily had hugged AHMED. From that moment to this, whenever AHMED sees Emily, he feels a warm feeling inside. Emily is approaching the corner where AHMED is waiting for his Baba to come pick him up. AHMED looks very uncomfortable all of a sudden. 'Oh no! Here is my Baba's jeep coming around the corner.\n\n Baba is coming! Emily is coming! Baba is coming! Emily is coming!' AHMED quickly sits on the floor and pretends to tie his shoelaces while attempting to hide from his Baba and from Emily. But it is no use; the young boy can tell that his Baba has spotted him. The jeep pulls up to the kerb and AHMED's Baba steps out. Meanwhile, Emily is getting closer and closer, and now she can see AHMED and his Baba together next to the jeep. AHMED's Baba throws a smile. \n\n'Are you OK, my big boy?' I hate ThursdaysAdem stands up now and his Baba grabs a hold of him and gives him a big cuddle and a kiss. 'Come on AHMED,' says his Baba in a cheerful voice, 'won't you give me a kiss!' AHMED looks around, then quickly kisses his father on the cheek and jumps inside the jeep before Emily gets any closer and laughs at him for kissing and hugging his father when AHMED is a big boy now and should be more grownup. Father and son do not talk to each other for a couple of minutes as they drive through the busy streets heading for home. Baba looks at AHMED and asks again, 'Are you OK, my son?' 'Yes,' says AHMED, but his voice is not very convincing. \n\nAHMED's Baba knows that his son is not happy because he knows him very well and they are very close. 'Come on,' he says, 'why don't you tell me what is wrong.' AHMED thinks for a little while. He knows what to say, but he does not want to hurt his Baba's feelings. Eventually, the young boy summons up the courage to speak his mind. 'Baba, there is something I need to tell you, something that upsets me. There is a person who upsets me. \n\nThat person is...' \nAHMED pauses for a moment, unsure how to continue. 'Someone has upset you! Tell me who it is.' Baba says to his son. 'Well it is...' 'Yes ...Come on!' 'Well...' 'Is it someone at school, a teacher, a friend, a bully?' asks Baba, clearly concerned for his son 'No, Baba.' 'Who then?' There is another long silence as Baba steers the jeep through the village towards home. AHMED takes a deep breath, then says, 'It is you, Baba. You upset me.' 'Me?' asks his Baba. 'What have I done, my son?' AHMED does not say anything, so Baba pulls the jeep into the kerb and switches off the engine so that he can properly talk to his son. 'Tell me what did I do, AHMED?' AHMED looks at his Baba, at his big bushy eyebrows and the lines that crease his forehead and make him look like he is angry. AHMED knows that his father is not angry but upset.\n\n He feels bad that he has made his Baba sad, but he plucks up all of his courage and tries to explain himself. 'You know that I am eleven now,' he tells his Baba. 'and that I am very grownup.' 'Yes definitely,' says his Baba with a touch of pride in his voice. 'You know it was OK to cuddle me and kiss me in front of my friends when I was at primary school, but I do not want you to do that in front of my friends anymore.' 'So... you do not want me to kiss and cuddle you anymore, is that it?' 'No, no, Baba. I like it when you cuddle me, but I don't want you to kiss and cuddle me in front of my friends at school because I am too old for that now and they will laugh at me.' 'It is a very Turkish thing to do, I suppose,' admits Baba as he starts up the jeep and steers into the evening traffic. He looks a little sad and AHMED wants to cheer him up.\n\n 'Baba?' 'Yes, my son?' 'Shall I make a cup of tea for you and mummy when we get home?' Baba smiles at his precious son. 'That would be lovely, AHMED. But please do not put any milk in my tea. You know that I like it black. This is the Turkish way to have tea and the Turkish way is best for me.' His Baba winks at AHMED as he says these words. AHMED smiles because he knows that his Baba understands why he was embarrassed, and he also knows that his Baba loves him very much. 'Can we play a game tonight?' asks AHMED as the jeep rounds the final bend towards home. \n\nBaba does not look upset anymore and reaches over and ruffles AHMED's hair and waves a finger at his son. 'We can play a game as long as you don't cheat again like you did last night.' 'I didn't cheat,' AHMED laughs. 'You cheated.' Baba and AHMED both laugh at this and continue talking about AHMED's day at school and all of the things he did and all the facts he has memorised from his Guinness Book of World Records. And that was the last time that Baba embarrassed AHMED in front of his friends. But whenever they are playing together at home, Baba will often grab his son and wrap his big arms around him and tease him that he is never be too big for a cuddle."

      "body": "Keep Your Dream Alive:\n\nI have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Ysidro. He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events to raise money for youth at risk programs. The last time I was there he introduced me by saying: “I want to tell you why I let Jack use my horse. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy’s high school career was continually interrupted. \n\nWhen he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.” “That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.” \n\n“He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, `See me after class.'” “The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, `Why did I receive an F?'” “The teacher said, `This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. \n\nYou have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you’ll have to pay large stud fees. There’s no way you could ever do it.’ Then the teacher added, `If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'” \n\n“The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, `Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.’ Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, ‘You can keep the F and I’ll keep my dream.'” Monty then turned to the assembled group and said, “I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.” \n\nHe added, “The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, the teacher said, ‘Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids’ dreams. Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up on yours.'” “Don’t let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what.”"

But little Amalie did. Yes, the student even taught her the whole song, \"Dance, Dance, Doll of Mine!\" and she sang it to her three dolls; two were new, one a girl doll and the other a boy doll, but the third doll was old; her name was Lise-moér. She also heard the song, and was even in it.\n\nDance, dance, doll of mine!\nGirl doll's dress is very fine.\nBoy doll is a dandy, too;\nHe wears gloves and hat and shoe;\nWhite pants, blue coat, him adorn;\nOn his toe he has a corn.\nHe is fine and she is fine.\nDance, dance, doll of mine!\n\nOld doll's name is Lise-moér;\nShe is from the year before;\nHair is new; it's made of flax,\nForehead polished up with wax.\nYoung again, not old and done.\nCome along, my cherished one,\nLet us dance a fast gavotte;\nTo watch it is worth a lot.\n\nDance, dance, doll of mine!\nWatch your steps and get in line;\nOne foot forward; watch your feet.\nDancing makes you slender, sweet.\nBow and twist and turn around;\nThat will make you hale and sound.\nWhat a sight it is to see!\nYou are doing fine, all three.\n\nAnd the dolls understood the song; little Amalie understood it, and so did the student, but then he had written it himself and said it was excellent. Only Aunt Malle didn't understand it; she had passed over the fence of youth. \"Silly song!\" she said.\n\nBut not little Amalie! She sings it. It is from her that we know it."

      "body": "The Galoshes Of Fortune:\n\nIt was in Copenhagen, in one of the houses on East Street, not far from King's Newmarket, that someone was giving a large party. For one must give a party once in a while, if one expects to be invited in return. Half of the guests were already at the card tables, and the rest were waiting to see what would come of their hostess's query:\n\n\"What can we think up now?\"\n\nUp to this point, their conversation had gotten along as best it might. Among other things, they had spoken of the Middle Ages. Some held that it was a time far better than our own. Indeed Councilor of Justice Knap defended this opinion with such spirit that his hostess sided with him at once, and both of them loudly took exception to Oersted's article in the Almanac, which contrasted old times and new, and which favored our own period. The Councilor of Justice, however, held that the time of King Hans, about 1500 A.D., was the noblest and happiest age.\n\nWhile the conversation ran pro and con, interrupted only for a moment by the arrival of a newspaper, in which there was nothing worth reading, let us adjourn to the cloak room, where all the wraps, canes, umbrellas, and galoshes were collected together. Here sat two maids, a young one and an old one. You might have thought they had come in attendance upon some spinster or widow, and were waiting to see their mistress home. However, a closer inspection would reveal that these were no ordinary serving women. Their hands were too well kept for that, their bearing and movements too graceful, and their clothes had a certain daring cut.\n\nThey were two fairies. The younger one, though not Dame Fortune herself, was an assistant to one of her ladies in waiting, and was used to deliver the more trifling gifts of Fortune. The older one looked quite grave. She was Dame Care, who always goes in her own sublime person to see to her errands herself, for then she knows that they are well done.\n\nThey were telling each other about where they had been that day. The assistant of Fortune had only attended to a few minor affairs, she said, such as saving a new bonnet from the rain, getting a civil greeting for an honest man from an exalted nincompoop, and such like matters. But her remaining errand was an extraordinary one.\n\n\"I must also tell you,\" she said, \"that today is my birthday, and in honor of this I have been entrusted to bring a pair of galoshes to mankind. These galoshes have this peculiarity, that whoever puts them on will immediately find himself in whatever time, place, and condition of life that he prefers. His every wish in regard to time and place will instantly be granted, so for once a man can find perfect happiness here below.\"\n\n\"Take my word for it.\" said Dame Care, \"he will be most unhappy, and will bless the moment when he can rid himself of those galoshes.\"\n\n\" How can you say such a thing?\" the other woman exclaimed. \"I shall leave them here beside the door, where someone will put them on by mistake and immediately be the happy one.\"\n\nThat ended their conversation.\n\nII. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNCILOR OF JUSTICE\n\nIt was getting late when Councilor Knap decided to go home. Lost in thought about the good old days of King Hans, as fate would have it, he put on the galoshes of Fortune instead of his own, and wore them out into East Street. But the power that lay in the galoshes took him back into the reign of King Hans, and as the streets were not paved in those days his feet sank deep into the mud and the mire.\n\n\"Why, how deplorable!\" the Councilor of Justice said. \"The whole sidewalk is gone and all the street lights are out.\"\n\nAs the moon had no yet risen high enough, and the air was somewhat foggy, everything around him was dark and blurred. At the next corner a lantern hung before an image of the Madonna, but for all the light it afforded him it might as well not have been there. Only when he stood directly under it did he make out that painting of the mother and child.\n\n\"It's probably an art museum,\" he thought, \"and they have forgotten to take in the sign.\"\n\nTwo people in medieval costumes passed by.\n\n\"How strange they looked!\" he said. \"They must have been to a masquerade.\"\n\nJust then the sound of drums and fifes came his way, and bright torches flared. The Councilor of Justice stopped and was startled to see an odd procession go past, led by a whole band of drummers who were dexterously drubbing away. These were followed by soldiers armed with long bows and crossbows. The chief personage of the procession was a churchman of rank. The astounded Councilor asked what all this meant, and who the man might be.\n\n\"That is the Bishop of Seeland,\" he was told.\n\n\"What in the name of heaven can have come over the Bishop?\" the Councilor of Justice wondered. He sighed and shook his head. \"The Bishop? Impossible.\"\n\nStill pondering about it, without glancing to right or to left, he kept on down East Street and across Highbridge Square. The bridge that led from there to Palace Square was not to be found at all; at last on the bank of the shallow stream he saw a boat with two men in it.\n\n\"Would the gentleman want to be ferried over to the Holm\"? they asked him.\n\n\"To the Holm?\" blurted the Councilor, who had not the faintest notion that he was living in another age. \"I want to go to Christian's Harbour on Little Market Street.\"\n\nThe men gaped at him.\n\n\"Kindly tell me where the bridge is,\" he said. \"It's disgraceful that all the street lamps are out, and besides, it's as muddy to walk here as in a swamp.\" But the more he talked with the boatmen, the less they understood each other. \"I can't understand your jabbering Bornholm accent,\" he finally said, and angrily turned his back on them. But no bridge could he find. Even the fence was gone.\n\n\"What a scandalous state of affairs! What a way for things to look!\" he said. Never had he been so disgruntled with his own age as he was this evening. \"I think I'd better take a cab.\" But where were the cabs? There were none in sight. \"I'll have to go back to King's Newmarket, where there is a cab stand, or I shall never reach Christian's Harbour.\"\n\nSo back he trudged to East Street, and had nearly walked the length of it when the moon rose.\n\n\"Good Heavens, what have they been building here?\" he cried as he beheld the East Gate, which in the old days stood at the end of East Street. In time, however, he found a gate through which he passed into what is now Newmarket. But all he saw there was a large meadow. A few bushes rose here and there and the meadow was divided by a wide canal or stream. The few wretched wooden huts on the far shore belonged to Dutch sailors, so at that time the place was called Dutch Meadow.\n\n\"Either I'm seeing what is called Fata Morgana, or I'm drunk,\" the Councilor of Justice moaned. \"What sort of place is this? Where am I?\" He turned back, convinced that he must be a very ill man. As he walked through the street again he paid more attention to the houses. Most of them were of wood, and many were thatched with straw.\n\n\"No, I don't feel myself at all,\" he complained. \"I only took one glass of punch, but it doesn't agree with me. The idea of serving punch with hot salmon! I'll speak about it severely to our hostess-that agent's wife. Should I march straight back and tell her how I feel? No, that would be in bad taste, and besides I doubt whether her household is still awake.\" He searched for the house, but wasn't able to find it.\n\n\"This is terrible!\" he cried. \"I don't even recognize East Street. There's not a shop to be seen; wretched old ramshackle huts are all I see, as if I were in Roskilde or Ringstedt. Oh, but I'm ill! There's no point in standing on ceremony, but where on earth is the agent's house? This hut doesn't look remotely like it, but I can hear that the people inside are still awake. Ah, I'm indeed a very sick man.\"\n\nHe reached a half-open door, where light flickered through the crack. It was a tavern of that period-a sort of alehouse. The room had the look of a farmer's clay-floored kitchen in Holstein, and the people who sat there were sailors, citizens of Copenhagen, and a couple of scholars. Deep in conversation over their mugs, they paid little attention to the newcomer.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" the Councilor of Justice said to the landlady who came toward him, \"but I am far from well. Would you send someone for a cab to take me to Christian's Harbour?\"\n\nThe woman stared at him, shook her head, and addressed him in German. As the Councilor of Justice supposed that she could not speak Danish, he repeated his remarks in German. This, and the cut of his clothes, convinced the woman that he was a foreigner. She soon understood that he felt unwell, and fetched him a mug of water, decidedly brackish, for she drew it directly from the sea-level well outside. The Councilor put his head in his hands, took a deep breath, and thought over all of the queer things that surrounded him.\n\n\"Is that tonight's number of The Day?\" he remarked from force of habit, as he saw the woman putting away a large folded sheet.\n\nWithout quite understanding him, she handed him the paper. It was a woodcut, representing a meteor seen in the skies over Cologne.\n\n\"This is very old,\" said the Councilor, who became quite enthusiastic about his discovery. \"Where did you get this rare old print? It's most interesting, although of course the whole matter is a myth. In this day and age, such meteors are explained away as a manifestation of the Northern Lights, probably caused by electricity.\"\n\nThose who sat near him heard the remark and looked at him in astonishment. One of them rose, respectfully doffed his hat, and said with the utmost gravity:\n\n\"Sir, you must be a great scholar.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" replied the Councilor. \"I merely have a word or two to say about things that everyone should know.\"\n\n\"Modestia is an admirable virtue,\" the man declared. \"In regard to your statement, I must say, mihi secus videtur, though I shall be happy to suspend myjudicium.\"\n\n\"May I ask whom I have the pleasure of addressing?\" the Councilor of Justice inquired.\n\n\"I am a Bachelor of Theology,\" the man told him in Latin.\n\nThis answer satisfied the Councilor of Justice, for the degree was in harmony with the fellow's way of dressing. \"Obviously,\" he thought, \"this is some old village schoolmaster, an odd character such as one still comes across now and then, up in Jut land.\"\n\n\"This is scarcely a locus docendi,\" the man continued, \"but I entreat you to favor us with your conversation. You, of course, are well read in the classics?\"\n\n\"Oh, more or less,\" the Councilor agreed. \"I like to read the standard old books, and the new ones too, except for those 'Every Day Stories' of which we have enough in reality.\"\n\n\"Every Day Stories?\" our bachelor asked.\n\n\"Yes, I mean these modern novels.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the man said with a smile. \"Still they are very clever, and are popular with the court. King Hans is particularly fond of the 'Romance of Iwain and Jawain,' which deals with King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The king has been known to jest with his lords about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Councilor, \"one can't keep up with all the new books. I suppose it has just been published by Heiberg.\"\n\n\"No,\" the man said, \"not by Heiberg, but by Gotfred von Ghemen.\"\n\n\"Indeed! What a fine old name for a literary man. Why Gotfred von Ghemen was the first printer in Denmark.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the man agreed, \"he is our first and foremost printer.\"\n\nThus far, their conversation had flowed quite smoothly. Now one of the townsmen began to talk about the pestilence which had raged some years back, meaning the plague of 1484. The Councilor understood him to mean the last epidemic of cholera, so they agreed well enough.\n\nThe freebooter's War of 1490 was so recent that it could not be passed over. The English raiders had taken ships from our harbor, they said, and the Councilor of Justice, who was well posted on the affair of 1801, manfully helped them to abuse the English.\n\nAfter that, however, the talk floundered from one contradiction to another. The worthy bachelor was so completely unenlightened that the Councilor's most commonplace remarks struck him as being too daring and too fantastic. They stared at each other, and when they reached an impasse the bachelor broke into Latin, in the hope that he would be better understood, but that didn't help.\n\nThe landlady plucked at the Councilor's sleeve and asked him, \"How do you feel now?\" This forcibly recalled to him all of those things which he had happily forgotten in the heat of his conversation.\n\n\"Merciful heaven, where am I?\" he wondered, and the thought made him dizzy.\n\n\"We will drink claret wine, and mead, and Bremen beer,\" one of the guests cried out, \"and you shall drink with us.\"\n\nTwo girls came in, and one of them wore a cap of two colors. They filled the glasses and made curtsies. The Councilor felt cold shivers up and down his spine. \"What is all this? What is all this?\" he groaned, but drink with them he must. They overwhelmed him with their kind intentions until he despaired, and when one man pronounced him drunk he didn't doubt it in the least. All he asked was that they get him a droschke.\" Then they thought he was speaking in Russian.\n\nNever before had he been in such low and vulgar company! \"One would think that the country had lapsed back into barbarism,\" he told himself. \"This is the most dreadful moment of my life.\"\n\nThen it occurred to him to slip down under the table, crawl to the door, and try to sneak out, but just as he neared the threshold his companions discovered him and tried to pull him out by his feet. However, by great good luck they pulled off his galoshes, and-with them-the whole enchantment.\n\nThe Councilor of Justice now distinctly saw a street lamp burning in front of a large building. He knew the building and the other buildings near-by. It was East Street as we all know it today. He lay on the pavement with his legs against a gate, and across the way a night watchman sat fast asleep.\n\n\"Merciful heavens! Have I been lying here in the street dreaming?\" the Councilor of Justice said. \"To be sure, this is East Street. How blessedly bright and how colorful it looks. But what dreadful effect that one glass of punch must have had on me.\"\n\nTwo minutes later he was seated in a cab, and well on his way to Christian's Harbour. As he recalled all the past terror and distress to which he had been subjected, he wholeheartedly approved of the present, our own happy age. With all its shortcomings it was far preferable to that age into which he had recently stumbled. And that, thought the Councilor of Justice, was good common sense.\n\nIII. THE WATCHMAN'S ADVENTURE\n\n\"Why, I declare! There's a pair of galoshes,\" said the watchman. They must belong to the lieutenant who lives up there on the top floor, for they are lying in front of the door.\" A light still burned upstairs, and the honest fellow was perfectly willing to ring the bell and return the overshoes. But he didn't want to disturb the other tenants in the house, so he didn't do it.\n\n\"It must be quite comfortable to wear a pair of such things,\" he said. \"How soft the leather feels.\" They fitted his feet perfectly. \"What a strange world we live in. The lieutenant might be resting easy in his soft bed, yet there he goes, pacing to and fro past his window. There's a happy man for you! He has no wife, and he has no child, and every night he goes to a party. Oh, if I were only in his place, what a happy man I would be.\"\n\nJust as he expressed his wish, the galoshes transformed him into the lieutenant, body and soul, and there he stood in the room upstairs. Between his fingers he held a sheet of pink paper on which the lieutenant had just written a poem. Who is there that has not at some time in his life felt poetic? If he writes down his thoughts while this mood is on him, poetry is apt to come of it. On the paper was written:\n\nIF ONLY I WERE RICH\n\nIf only I were rich; I often said in prayer\nWhen I was but a tiny lad without much care\nIf only I were rich, a soldier I would be\nWith uniform and sword, most handsomely;\nAt last an officer I was, my wish I got\nBut to be rich was not my lot;\nBut You, oh Lord, would always help.\n\nI sat one eve, so happy, young and proud;\nA darling child of seven kissed my mouth\nFor I was rich with fairy tales, you see\nWith money I was poor as poor can be,\nBut she was fond of tales I told\nThat made me rich, but - alas - not with gold;\nBut You, oh Lord, You know!\n\nIf only I were rich, is still my heavenly prayer.\nMy little girl of seven is now a lady fair;\nShe is so sweet, so clever and so good;\nMy heart's fair tale she never understood.\nIf only, as of yore, she still for me would care,\nBut I am poor and silent; I confess I do not dare.\nIt is Your will, oh Lord!\n\nIf only I were rich, in peace and comfort rest,\nI would my sorrow to this paper never trust.\nYou, whom I love, if still you understand\nthen read this poem from my youth's far land,\nThough best it be you never know my pain.\nI am still poor, my future dark and vain,\nBut may, O Lord, You bless her!\n\nYes, a man in love writes many a poem that a man in his right mind does not print. A lieutenant, his love and his lack of money - there's an eternal triangle for you, a broken life that can never be squared. The lieutenant knew this all too well. He leaned his head against the window, and sighed, and said:\n\n\"The poor watchman down there in the street is a far happier man than I. He does not know what I call want. He has a home. He has a wife and children who weep with him in his sorrows and share in his joy. Ah, I would be happier if I could trade places with him, for he is much more fortunate than I am.\"\n\nInstantly, the watchman was himself again. The galoshes had transformed him into the lieutenant, as we have seen. He was far less contended up there, and preferred to be just what he had been. So the watchman turned back into a watchman.\n\n\"I had a bad dream,\" he said. \"Strangely enough, I fancied I was the lieutenant, and I didn't like it a bit. I missed my wife and our youngsters, who almost smother me with their kisses.\"\n\nHe sat down and fell to nodding again, unable to get the dream out of his head. The galoshes were still on his feet when he watched a star fall in the sky.\n\n\"There goes one,\" he muttered. \"But there are so many it will never be missed. I'd like to have a look at those trinkets at close range. I'd especially like to see the moon, which is not the sort of thing to get lost in one's hands. The student for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we fly about from star to star. There's not a word of truth in it. But it would be nice, just the same, if I could take a little jaunt through the skies. My body could stay here on the steps for all that I'd care.\"\n\nNow there are certain things in the world that we ought to think about before we put them into words, and if we are wearing the galoshes of Fortune it behooves us to think twice. Just listen to what happened to that watchman.\n\nAll of us know how fast steam can take us. We've either rushed along in a train or sped by steamship across the ocean. But all this is like the gait of a sloth, or the pace of a snail, in comparison with the speed of light, which travels nineteen million times faster than the fastest race horse. Yet electricity moves even faster. Death is an electric shock to the heart, and the soul set free travels on electric wings. The sunlight takes eight minutes and some odd seconds to travel nearly one hundred million miles. On the wings of electricity, the soul can make the same journey in a few moments, and to a soul set free the heavenly bodies are as close together as the houses of friends who live in the same town with us, or even in the same neighborhood. However, this electric shock strips us of our bodies forever, unless, like the watchman, we happen to be wearing the galoshes of Fortune.\n\nIn a few seconds the watchman took in his stride the two hundred and sixty thousand miles to the moon. As we know, this satellite is made of much lighter material than the earth, and is as soft as freshly fallen snow. The watchman landed in one of the numerous mountain rings which we all know from Doctor Maedler's large map of the moon. Within the ring was a great bowl, fully four miles deep. At the bottom of this bowl lay a town. We may get some idea of what it looked like by pouring the white of an egg into a glass of water. The town was made of stuff as soft as the egg albumen, and its form was similar, with translucent towers, cupolas, and terraces, all floating in thin air.\n\nOver the watchman's head hung our earth, like a huge dull red ball. Around him he noticed crowds of beings who doubtless corresponded to men and women of the earth, but their appearance was quite different from ours. They also had their own way of speaking, but no one could expect that the soul of a watchman would understand them. Nevertheless he did understand the language of the people in the moon very well. They were disputing about our earth, and doubting whether it could be inhabited. The air on the earth, they contended, must be too thick for any intelligent moon-man to live there. Only the moon was inhabited, they agreed, for it was the original sphere on which the people of the Old World lived.\n\nNow let us go back down to East Street, to see how the watchman's body was making out. Lifeless it lay, there on the steps. His morning star, that spiked club which watchmen carry, had fallen from his hands, and his eyes were turned toward the moon that his honest soul was exploring.\n\n\"What's the hour, watchman?\" asked a passer-by. But never an answer did he get. He gave the watchman a very slight tweak of the nose, and over he toppled. There lay the body at full length, stretched on the pavement. The man was dead. It gave the one who had tweaked him a terrible fright, for the watchman was dead, and dead he remained. His death was reported, and investigated. As day broke, his body was taken to the hospital.\n\nIt would be a pretty pass if the soul should come back and in all probability look for its body in East Street, and fail to find it. Perhaps it would rush to the police station first, next to the Directory Office where it could advertise for lost articles, and last of all to the hospital. But we needn't worry. The soul by itself is clever enough. It's the body that makes it stupid.\n\nAs we said before, the watchman's body was taken to the hospital. They put it in a room to be washed, and naturally the galoshes were pulled off first of all. That brought the soul dashing back posthaste, and in a flash the watchman came back to life. He swore it had been the most terrible night he had ever experienced, and he would never go through it again, no, not for two pennies. But it was over and done with. He was allowed to leave that same day, but the galoshes were left at the hospital.\n\nIV. A GREAT MOMENT, AND A MOST EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY\n\nEveryone in Copenhagen knows what the entrance to Frederic's Hospital looks like, but as some of the people who read this story may not have been to Copenhagen, we must describe the building-briefly.\n\nThe hospital is fenced off from the street by a rather high railing of heavy iron bars, which are spaced far enough apart-at least so the story goes-for very thin internes to squeeze between them and pay little visits to the world outside. The part of the body they had most difficulty in squeezing through was the head. In this, as often happens in the world, small heads were the most successful. So much for our description.\n\nOne of the young internes, of whom it could be said that he had a great head only in a physical sense, had the night watch that evening. Outside the rain poured down. But in spite of these difficulties he was bent upon getting out for a quarter of an hour. There was no need for the doorman to know about it, he thought, if he could just manage to slip through the fence. There lay the galoshes that the watchman had forgotten, and while the interne had no idea that they were the galoshes of Fortune, he did know that they would stand him in good stead out in the rain. So he pulled them on. Now the question was whether he could squeeze between the bars, a trick that he had never tried before. There he stood, facing the fence.\n\n\"I wish to goodness I had my head through,\" he said, and though his head was much too large and thick for the space, it immediately slipped through quickly and with the greatest of ease. The galoshes saw to that. All he had to do now was to squeeze his body through after his head, but it wouldn't go. \"Uff!\" he panted, \"I'm too fat. I thought my head would be the worst difficulty. No, I shall never get through.\"\n\nHe quickly attempted to pull his head back again, but it couldn't be done. He could move his neck easily, but that was all. First his anger flared up. Then his spirits dropped down to zero. The galoshes of Fortune had gotten him in a terrible fix, and unluckily it did not occur to him to wish his way out of it. No, instead of wishing he struggled and strove, but he could not budge from the spot. The rain poured down; not a soul could be seen in the street; and he could not reach the bell by the gate. How could he ever get free? He was certain he would have to stay there till morning, and that they would have to send for a blacksmith to file through the iron bars. It would take time. All the boys in the school across the way would be up and shout, and the entire population of \"Nyboder,\" where all the sailors lived, would turn out for the fun of seeing the man in a pillory. Why, he would draw a bigger crowd than the one that went to see the championship wrestling matches last year.\n\n\"Huff!\" he panted, \"the blood's rushing to my head. I'm going mad! Yes, I'm going mad! Oh, if I were only free again, and out of this fix, then I would be all right again.\"\n\nThis was what he ought to have said in the first place. No sooner had he said it than his head came free, and he dashed indoors, still bewildered by the fright that the galoshes of Fortune had given him. But don't think that this was the end of it. No! The worst was yet to come.\n\nThe night went by, and the next day passed, but nobody came for the galoshes. That evening there was to be a performance at the little theatre in Kannike Street. The house was packed and in the audience was our friend, the interne, apparently none the worse for his adventure of the night before. He had again put on the galoshes. After all, no one had claimed them, and the streets were so muddy that he thought they would stand him in good stead.\n\nAt the theatre a new sketch was presented. It was called \"My Grandmother's Spectacles and had to do with a pair of eyeglasses which enabled anyone who wore them to read the future from people's faces, just as a fortune teller reads it from cards.\n\nThe idea occupied his mind very much. He would like to own such a pair of spectacles. Properly used, they might enable one to see into people's hearts. This, he thought, would be far more interesting than foresee what would happen next year. Future events would be known in due time, but no one would ever know the secrets that lie in people's hearts.\n\n\"Look at those ladies and gentlemen in the front row,\" he said to himself. \"If I could see straight into their hearts what stores of things-what great shops full of goods would I behold. And how my eyes would rove about those shops. In every feminine heart, no doubt I should find a complete millinery establishment. There sits one whose shop is empty, but a good cleaning would do it no harm. And of course some of the shops would be well stocked. Ah me,\" he sighed, \"I know of one where all the goods are of the very best quality, and it would just suit me, but-alas and alack-there's a shopkeeper there already, and he's the only bad article in the whole shop. Many a one would say, \"Won't you walk in?\" and I wish I could. I would pass like a nice little thought through their hearts.\"\n\nThe galoshes took him at his word. The interne shrank to almost nothing, and set out on a most extraordinary journey through the hearts of all the spectators in the first row. The first heart he entered was that of a lady, but at first he mistook it for a room in the Orthopaedic Institute, or Hospital, where the plaster casts of deformed limbs are hung upon the walls. The only difference was that at the hospital those casts were made when the patients came in, while these casts that were kept in the heart were made as the good people departed. For every physical or mental fault of the friends she had lost had been carefully stored away.\n\nHe quickly passed on to another woman's heart, which seemed like a great holy cathedral. Over the high altar fluttered the white dove of innocence, and the interne would have gone down on his knees except that he had to hurry on to the next heart. However, he still heard the organ roll. And he felt that it had made a new and better man of him-a man not too unworthy to enter the next sanctuary. This was a poor garret where a mother lay ill, but through the windows the sun shone, warm and bright. Lovely roses bloomed in the little wooden flower box on the roof, and two bluebirds sang of happy childhood, while the sick woman prayed for a blessing on her daughter.\n\nNext the interne crawled on his hands and knees through an overcrowded butcher shop. There was meat, more meat, and meat alone, wherever he looked in this heart of a wealthy, respectable man, whose name you can find in the directory.\n\nNext he entered the heart of this man's wife, and an old tumble-down dove-cot he found it. Her husband's portrait served as a mere weathervane, which was connected with the doors in such a way that they opened and closed as her husband turned round.\n\nThen he found his way into a cabinet of mirrors such as is to be seen at Rosenborg Castle, though in this heart the mirrors had the power of magnifying objects enormously. Like the Grand Lama of Tibet, the owner's insignificant ego sat in the middle of the floor, in admiring contemplation of his own greatness.\n\nAfter this he seemed to be crammed into a narrow case full of sharp needles. \"This,\" he thought, \"must certainly be an old maid's heart,\" but it was nothing of the sort. It was the heart of a very young officer who had been awarded several medals, and of whom everyone said, \"Now there's a man of both intellect and heart.\"\n\nQuite befuddled was the poor interne when he popped out of the heart of the last person in the front row. He could not get his thoughts in order, and he supposed that his strong imagination must have run away with him.\n\n\"Merciful heavens,\" he groaned, \"I must be well on the road to the madhouse. And it's so outrageously hot in here that the blood is rushing to my head.\" Suddenly he recalled what had happened the night before, when he had jammed his head between the bars of the hospital fence. \"That must be what caused it,\" he decided. \"I must do something before it is too late. A Russian bath might be the very thing. I wish I were on the top shelf right now.\"\n\nNo sooner said, than there he lay on the top shelf of the steam bath. But he was fully dressed, down to his shoes and galoshes. He felt the hot drops of condensed steam fall upon him from the ceiling.\n\n\" Hey!\" he cried, and jumped down to take a shower. The attendant cried out too when he caught sight of a fully dressed man in the steam room. However, the interne had enough sense to pull himself together and whisper, \"I'm just doing this because of a bet.\"\n\nBut the first thing he did when he got back to his room was to put hot plasters on his neck and his back, to draw out the madness.\n\nNext morning he had a blistered back and that was all he got out of the galoshes of Fortune.\n\nV. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE COPYING CLERK\n\nThe watchman-you remember him-happened to remember those galoshes he had found, and that he must have been wearing them when they took his body to the hospital. He came by for them, and as neither the lieutenant nor anyone else in East Street laid claim to them, he turned them in at the police station.\n\n\"They look exactly like my own galoshes,\" one of the copying clerks at the police station said, as he set the ownerless galoshes down beside his own. \"Not even a shoemaker could tell one pair from the other.\"\n\n\"Mr. Copying Clerk!\" said a policeman, who brought him some papers.\n\nThe clerk turned around to talk with the policeman, and when he came back to the galoshes he was uncertain whether the pair on the right or the pair on the left belonged to him.\n\n\"The wet ones must be mine,\" he thought, but he was mistaken, for they were the galoshes of Fortune. The police make their little mistakes too.\n\nSo he pulled them on, pocketed some papers, and tucked some manuscripts under his arm to read and abstract when he got home. But as this happened to be Sunday morning, and the weather was fine, he thought, \"A walk to Frederiksberg will be good for me.\" And off he went.\n\nA quieter, more dependable fellow than this young man you seldom see. Let him take his little walk, by all means. It will do him a world of good after so much sitting. At first he strode along without a wish in his head, so there was no occasion for the galoshes to show their magic power. On the avenue he met an acquaintance of his, a young poet, who said he was setting out tomorrow on a summer excursion.\n\n\"What, off again so soon?\" said the clerk. \"What a free and happy fellow you are! You can fly away wherever you like, while the rest of us are chained by the leg.\"\n\n\"Chained only to a breadfruit tree,\" the poet reminded him. \"You don't have to worry along from day to day, and when you get old they will give you a pension.\"\n\n\"You are better off, just the same,\" the clerk said. \"How agreeable it must be to sit and write poetry. Everyone pays you compliments, and you are your own master. Ah, you should see what it's like to devote your life to the trivial details of the courts.\"\n\nThe poet shook his head, and the clerk shook his too. Each held to his own conviction, and they parted company.\n\n\"They are a queer race, these poets.\" thought the clerk. \"I should like to try my hand at their trade-to turn poet myself. I'm sure I would never write such melancholy stuff as most of them do. What a splendid spring day this is, a day fit for a poet. The air is so unusually clear, the clouds so lovely, and the green grass so fragrant. For many a year I have not felt as I feel just now.\"\n\nAlready, you could tell that he had turned poet. Not that there was anything you could put your finger on, for it is foolish to suppose that a poet differs greatly from other people, some of whom are far more poetic by nature than many a great and accepted poet. The chief difference is that a poet has a better memory for things of the spirit. He can hold fast to an emotion and an idea until they are firmly and clearly embodied in words, which is something that others cannot do. But for a matter-of-fact person to think in terms of poetry is noticeable enough, and it is this transformation that we can see in the clerk.\n\n\"What a glorious fragrance there is in the air!\" he said. \"It reminds me of Aunt Lone's violets. Ah me, I haven't thought of them since I was a little boy. The dear old girl! She used to live over there, behind the Exchange. She always had a spray or a few green shoots in water, no matter how severe the winter was. I'd smell those violets even when I was putting hot pennies against the frozen window pane to make peep holes. What a view that was-ships frozen tight in the canal, deserted by their crew, and a shrieking crow the only living creature aboard them. But when the springtime breezes blew the scene turned lively again. There were shouts and laughter as the ice was sawed away. Freshly tarred and rigged, the ships sailed off for distant lands. I stayed here, and I must forever stay here, sitting in the police office where others come for their passports to foreign countries. Yes, that's my lot! Oh, yes!\" he said, and heaved a sigh. Then he stopped abruptly. \"Great heavens! What's come over me. I never thought or felt like this before. It must be the spring air! It is as frightening as it is pleasant.\" He fumbled among the papers in his pockets.\n\n\"These will give me something else to think about,\" he said, as he glanced at the first page. \"Lady Sigbrith, An Original Tragedy in Five Acts,\" he read. \"Why, what's this? It's in my own handwriting too. Have I written a tragedy? The Intrigue on the Ramparts, or The Great Fast Day - a Vaudeville. Where did that come from? Someone must have slipped it in my pocket. And here's a letter.\" It was from the board of directors of the theatre, who rejected his plays, and the letter was anything but politely phrased.\n\n\"Hem, hem!\" said the copying clerk as he sat down on a bench. His thoughts were lively and his heart sensitive. He plucked a flower at random, an ordinary little daisy. What the professor of botany requires several lectures to explain to us, this flower told in a moment. It told of the mystery birth, and of the power of the sunlight which opened those delicate leaves and gave them their fragrance. This made him think of the battle of life, which arouses emotions within us in similar fashion. Air and light are the flowers' lovers, but light is her favorite. Toward it the flower is ever turning, and only when the light is gone does she fold her petals and sleep in the air's embrace.\n\n\"It is the light that makes me lovely,\" the flower said.\n\n\"But,\" the poet's voice whispered, \"the air enables you to breathe.\"\n\nNot far away, a boy was splashing in a muddy ditch with his stick. As the water flew up among the green branches, the clerk thought of the innumerable microscopic creatures in the splashing drops. For them to be splashed so high, was as if we were to be tossed up into the clouds. As the clerk thought of these things, and of the great change that had come over him, he smiled and said:\n\n\"I must be asleep and dreaming. It's marvelous to be able to dream so naturally, and yet to know all along that this is a dream. I hope I can recall every bit of it tomorrow, when I wake up. I seem to feel unusually exhilarated. How clearly I understand things, and how wide awake I feel! But I know that if I recall my dream it will only be a lot of nonsense, as has happened to me so often before. All those brilliant and clever remarks one makes and one hears in his dreams, are like the gold pieces that goblins store underground. When one gets them they are rich and shining, but seen in the daylight they are nothing but rocks and dry leaves. Ah me,\" he sighed, as he sadly watched the singing birds flit merrily from branch to branch. \"They are so much better off than I. Flying is a noble art, and lucky is he who is born with wings. Yes, if I could change into anything I liked, I would turn into a little lark.\"\n\nIn a trice his coat-tails and sleeves grew together as wings, his clothes turned into feathers, and his galoshes became claws. He noticed the change clearly, and laughed to himself.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I know I am dreaming, but I never had a dream as silly as this one.\"\n\nUp he flew, and sang among the branches, but there was no poetry in his song, for he was no longer a poet. Like anyone who does a thoroughgoing job of it, the galoshes could only do one thing at a time. When he wishes to be a poet, a poet he became. Then he wanted to be a little bird, and in becoming one he lost his previous character.\n\n\"This is most amusing,\" he said. \"In the daytime I sit in the police office, surrounded by the most matter-of-fact legal papers, but by night I can dream that I'm a lark flying about in the Frederiksberg Garden. What fine material this would make for a popular comedy.\"\n\nHe flew down on the grass, twisting and turning his head, and pecking at the waving grass blades. In proportion to his own size, they seemed as large as the palm branches in North Africa. But this lasted only a moment. Then everything turned black, and it seemed as if some huge object had dropped over him. This was a big cap that a boy from Nyboder had thrown over the bird. A hand was thrust in. It laid hold of the copying clerk by his back and wing so tightly that it made him shriek. In his terror he called out, \"You impudent scoundrel! I am the copying clerk at the police office!\" But this sounded like \"Peep! peep!\" to the boy, who thumped the bird on its beak and walked off with it.\n\nOn the avenue this boy met with two other schoolboys. Socially, they were of the upper classes, though, properly ranked according to their merit, they were in the lowest class at school. They bought the bird for eight pennies, and in their hands the clerk came back to Copenhagen, to a family who lived in Gothers Street.\n\n\"It's a good thing I'm only dreaming this,\" said the clerk, \"or I'd be furious. First I was a poet, and now I'm a lark. It must have been my poetic temperament which turned me into this little creature. It is a very sad state of affairs, especially when one falls into the hands of a couple of boys. But I wonder how it will all turn out.\"\n\nThe boys carried him into a luxuriously appointed room, where a stout, affable lady received them. She was not at all pleased with their common little field bird, as she called the lark, but she said that, for one day only, they could keep it in the empty cage near the window.\n\n\"Perhaps Polly will like it,\" she said, and smiled at the large parrot that swung proudly to and fro on the ring in his ornate brass cage. \"It's Polly's birthday,\" she said, like a simpleton. \"The little field bird wants to congratulate him.\"\n\nPolly did not say a word, as proudly he swung back and forth. But a pretty canary bird who had been brought here last summer from his warm, sweet-scented homeland, began to sing at the top of his voice.\n\n\"Bawler!\" the lady said, and threw a white handkerchief over his cage.\n\n\"Peep, peep. What a terrible snowstorm,\" the canary sighed, and with that sigh he kept quiet.\n\nThe clerk, or as the lady called him, the field bird, was put in a cage next to the canary's and not far from the parrot's. The only human words that the parrot could say, and which at times sounded quite comical, were \"Come now, let us be men.\" All the rest of his chatter made as little sense as the twittering of the canary. However, the clerk, who was now a bird himself, understood his companions perfectly.\n\n\"I used to fly beneath green palms and flowering almond trees,\" the canary bird sang. \"With my brothers and sisters, I flew above beautiful flowers, and over the smooth sea where the plants that grow under water waved up at us. We used to meet many brilliant parrots, who told us the funniest stories-long ones and so many.\"\n\n\"Those were wild parrots!\" said Polly. \"Birds without any education. Come now, let us be men. Why don't you laugh? If the lady and all her guests laugh at my remark, so should you. To lack a sense of humor is a very bad thing. Come now, let us be men.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the pretty girls who danced in the tents spread beneath those flowering trees?\" the canary sang. \"Do you remember those delicious sweet fruits, and the cool juice of the wild plants?\"\n\n\"Why yes,\" said the parrot, \"but I am much better off here, where I get the best of food and intimate treatment. I know that I am a clever bird, and that's enough for me. Come now, let us be men. You have the soul of a poet, as they call it, and I have sound knowledge and wit. You have genius, but no discretion. You burst into that shrill, spontaneous song of yours. That's why people cover you up. They don't ever treat me like that. No, I have cost them a lot and, what is more imposing, my beak and my wits are sharp. Come now, let us be men.\"\n\n\"Oh, my warm flowery homeland!\" said the canary. \"I shall sing of your deep green trees and your quiet inlets, where the down-hanging branches kiss the clear mirror of the waters. I shall sing of my resplendent brothers and sisters, who rejoice as they hover over the cups of water in the cactus plants that thrive in the desert.\"\n\n\"Kindly stop your whimpering tunes,\" the parrot said. \"Sing something to make us laugh. Laughter is a sign of the loftiest intellectual development. Can a dog or a horse laugh? No! They can cry, but as for laughter-that is given to mankind alone. Ho, ho, ho!\" the parrot chuckled, and added his, \"Come now, let us be men.\"\n\n\"You little grey bird of Denmark,\" the canary said to the lark, \"have they made you a prisoner too? Although it must be very cold in your woods, you have your freedom there. Fly away! They have forgotten to close your cage. The door of the top is open. Fly! fly!\"\n\nWithout pausing to think, the clerk did as he was told. In a jiffy he was out of the cage. But just as he escaped from his prison, the half-open door leading into the next room began to creak. Stealthily, with green shining eyes, the house cat pounced in and gave chase to him. The canary fluttered in his cage. The parrot flapped his wings and called out, \"Come now, let us be men.\" The dreadfully frightened clerk flew out of the window and away over the streets and houses, until at last he had to stop to rest.\n\nThat house across the street looked familiar. He flew in through one of its open windows. As he perched on the table he found that he was in his own room.\n\n\"Come now, let us be men,\" he blurted out, in spontaneous mockery of the parrot. Instantly he resumed the body of the copying clerk, who sat there, perched on the table.\n\n\"How in the name of heaven,\" he said, \"do I happen to be sleeping here? And what a disturbing dream I've had-all nonsense from beginning to end.\"\n\nVI. THE BEST THAT THE GALOSHES BROUGHT\n\nEarly the next morning, before the clerk was out of bed, someone tapped on his door. In walked his neighbor, a young theological student who lived on the same floor.\n\n\"Lend me your galoshes,\" he requested. \"It is very wet in the garden, but the sun is shining so gloriously that I'd like to smoke a pipeful down there.\"\n\nHe pulled on the galoshes and went out into the garden, where there was one plum tree and a pear tree. But even a little garden like this one is a precious thing in Copenhagen.\n\nIt was only six o'clock. As the student walked up and down the path, he heard the horn of a stagecoach in the street.\n\n\"Oh, to travel, to travel!\" he exclaimed, \"that's the most pleasant thing in the world. It's the great goal of all my dreams. If only I could travel, I'm sure that this restlessness within me would be stilled. But it must be far, far away. How I should like to see beautiful Switzerland, to tour Italy, and-\"\n\nFortunately the galoshes began to function at once, or he might have traveled entirely too much to suit him or to please us. Travel he did. He was high up in Switzerland, tightly packed in a diligence with eight other travelers. He had a pain in his head, his neck felt tired, and the blood had ceased to circulate in his legs. His feet were swollen and his heavy boots hurt him. He was half awake and half asleep. In his right-hand pocket he had his letter of credit, in his left-hand pocket he had his passport, and sewn into a little bag inside his breast pocket he had a few gold pieces. Every time he dozed off he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these things. Starting feverishly awake, his first movement would be to trace with his hand a triangle from right to left, and up to his breast, to feel whether his treasures were still there.\n\nUmbrellas, hats, and walking sticks swung in the net above him and almost spoiled the magnificent view. As he glanced out the window his heart sang, as at least one poet has sung in Switzerland, these as yet unpublished words:\n\n\"This view is as fine as a view can be.\nMount Blanc is sublime beyond a doubt,\nAnd the traveler's life is the life for me-\nBut only as long as my money holds out.\"\nVast, severe, and somber was the whole landscape around him. The pine woods looked like patches of heather on the high cliffs, whose summits were lost in fog and cloud. Snow began to fall, and the cold wind blew.\n\n\"Ah,\" he sighed, \"if only we were on the other side of the Alps, then it would be summer weather and I could get some money on my letter of credit. Worrying about my finances spoils all my enjoyment of Switzerland. Oh, if only I were on the other side.\"\n\nAnd there he was on the other side, in the middle of Italy, between Florence and Rome. Before him lay Lake Thrasymene. In the evening light it looked like a sheet of flaming gold among the dark blue hills. Here, where Hannibal beat Flaminius, the grape vines clung peacefully to each other with their green tendrils. Pretty little half-clothed children tended a herd of coal-black pigs under a fragrant clump of laurels by the roadside, and if we could paint the scene in its true colors all would exclaim, \"Glorious Italy!\" But neither the student nor his companions in the stagecoach made any such exclamation.\n\nPoisonous flies and gnats swarmed into the coach by the thousands. In vain the travelers tried to beat them off with myrtle branches. The flies stung just the same. There was not a passenger whose face was not puffed and spotted with bites. The poor horses looked like carcasses. The flies made life miserable for them, and it only brought them a momentary relief when the coachman got down and scraped off swarms of the insects that settled upon them.\n\nOnce the sun went down, an icy chill fell upon everything. It wasn't at all pleasant. However, the hills and clouds took on that wonderful green tint, so clear and so shining. Yes, go and see for yourself. That is far better than to read about it. It was a lovely sight, and the travelers thought so too, but their stomachs were empty, their bodies exhausted, and every thought in their heads was directed toward a lodging for the night. But where would they lodge? They watched the road ahead far more attentively than they did the splendid view.\n\nTheir road ran through an olive grove, and the student could fancy that he was at home, passing through a wood of gnarled willow trees. And there stood a lonely inn. A band of crippled beggars were camping outside and the liveliest among them looked like the eldest son of Famine who had just come of age. The rest either were blind, or so lame that they crawled about on their hands, or had withered arms and hands without any fingers. Here really was misery in rags.\n\n\"Eccelenza, miserabili!\" they groaned, and stretched forth their crippled limbs. The hostess herself went barefoot. With uncombed hair and an unwashed blouse, she received her guests. The doors were hinged with string; half of the bricks of the floors had been put to other use; bats flew about the ceiling; and the smell-\n\n\"It were better to have supper in the stable,\" one traveler maintained. \"There one at least knows what he is breathing.\"\n\nThe windows were opened to let a little fresh air come inside, but swifter than the air came those withered arms and that perpetual whine, \"Miserabili, eccellenza.\" On the walls were many inscriptions, and half of them had little good to say for la bella Italia.\n\nSupper was served. Supper was a watery soup flavored with pepper and rancid oil. This same oil was the better part of the salad. Dubious eggs and roasted cockscombs were the best dishes, and even the wine was distasteful. It was a frightful collation.\n\nThat night the trunks were piled against the door, and one of the travelers mounted guard while the others slept. The student stood the first guard mount. How close it was in there! The heat was overpowering, the gnats droned and stabbed, and outside, the miserabiliwhined in their dreams.\n\n\"Traveling,\" said the student, \"would be all very well if one had no body. Oh, if only the body could rest while the spirit flies on without it. Wherever I go, there is some lack that I feel in my heart. There is always something better than the present that I desire. Yes, something better-the best of all, but what is it, and where shall I find it? Down deep in my heart, I know what I want. I want to reach a happy goal, the happiest goal of all.\"\n\nAs soon as the words were said, he found himself back in his home. Long white curtains draped the windows, and in the middle of the floor a black coffin stood. In this he lay, sleeping the quiet sleep of death. His wish was fulfilled-his body was at rest, and his spirit was free to travel. \"Call no man happy until he rests in his grave,\" said Solon, and here his words proved true again.\n\nEvery corpse is a sphinx of immortality. The sphinx in this black casket that confronts us could say no more than the living man had written two days before:\n\n\"Stern Death, your silence has aroused my fears.\nShall not my soul up Jacob's ladder pass,\nOr shall your stone weight me throughout the years,\nAnd I rise only in the graveyard grass?\n\n\"Our deepest grief escapes the world's sad eye!\nYou who are lonely to the very last,\nA heavier burden on your heart must lie\nThan all the earth upon your coffin cast!\"\n\nTwo figures moved about the room. We know them both. Those two who bent over the dead man were Dame Care and Fortune's minion.\n\n\"Now,\" said Care, \"you can see what happiness your galoshes have brought mankind.\"\n\n\"They have at least brought everlasting rest to him who here lies sleeping,\" said Fortune's minion.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Care. \"He went of his own free will. He was not called away. His spiritual power was not strong enough to undertake the glorious tasks for which he is destined. I shall do him a favor.\"\n\nShe took the galoshes from his feet. Then the sleep of death was ended, and the student awakened to life again. Care vanished, and she took the galoshes along with her, for she probably regarded them as her own property."

      "body": "The Story Of A Mother:\n\nA mother sat by her little child. She was so sad, so afraid he would die. The child's face was pallid. His little eyes were shut. His breath came faintly now, and then heavily as if he were sighing, and the mother looked more sadly at the dear little soul.\n\nThere came a knocking at the door, and a poor old man hobbled into the house. He was wrapped in a thick horseblanket. It kept him warm and he needed it to keep out the wintry cold, for outside the world was covered with snow and ice, and the wind cut like a knife.\n\nAs the child was resting quietly for a moment, and the old man was shivering from the cold, the mother put a little mug of beer to warm on the stove for him. The old man rocked the cradle and the mother sat down near it to watch her sick child, who labored to draw each breath. She lifted his little hand, and asked:\n\n\"You don't think I shall lose him, do you? Would the good Lord take him from me?\"\n\nThe old man was Death himself. He jerked his head strangely, in a way that might mean yes or might mean no. The mother bowed her head and tears ran down her cheeks. Her head was heavy.\n\nFor three days and three nights she had not closed her eyes. Now she dozed off to sleep, but only a moment. Something startled her and she awoke, shuddering in the cold.\n\n\"What was that?\" she said, looking everywhere about the room. But the old man had gone and her little child had gone. Death had taken the child away. The old clock in the corner whirred and whirred. Its heavy lead weight dropped down to the floor with a thud. Bong! the clock stopped. The poor mother rushed wildly out of the house, calling for her child.\n\nOut there in the snow sat a woman, dressed in long black garments. \"Death,\" she said, \"has been in your house. I just saw him hurrying away with your child in his arms. He goes faster than the wind. And he never brings back what he has taken away.\"\n\n\"Tell me which way he went,\" said the mother. \"Only tell me the way, and I will find him.\"\n\n\"I know the way,\" said the woman in black, \"but before I tell you, you must sing to me all those songs you used to sing to your child. I am night. I love lullabies and I hear them often. When you sang them I saw your tears.\"\n\n\"I shall sing them again-you shall hear them all,\" said the mother, \"but do not stop me now. I must catch him. I must hurry to find my child.\"\n\nNight kept silent and still, while the mother wrung her hands, and sang, and wept. She sang many songs, but the tears that she shed were many, many more. At last Night said to her, \"Go to the right. Go into the dark pine woods. I saw Death go there with your child.\"\n\nDeep into the woods the mother came to a crossroad, where she was at a loss which way to go. At the crossroad grew a blackthorn bush, without leaf or flower, for it was wintertime and its branches were glazed with ice.\n\n\"Did you see Death go by with my little child?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the blackthorn bush. \"But I shall not tell you which way he went unless you warm me against your heart. I am freezing to death. I am stiff with ice.\"\n\nShe pressed the blackthorn bush against her heart to warm it, and the thorns stabbed so deep into her flesh that great drops of red blood flowed. So warm was the mother's heart that the blackthorn bush blossomed and put forth green leaves on that dark winter's night. And it told her the way to go.\n\nThen she came to a large lake, where there was neither sailboat nor rowboat. The ice on the lake was too thin to hold her weight, and yet not open or shallow enough for her to wade. But across the lake she must go if ever she was to find her child. She stooped down to drink the lake dry, and that of course was impossible for any human being, but the poor woman thought that maybe a miracle would happen.\n\n\"No, that would never do,\" the lake objected. \"Let us make a bargain between us. I collect pearls, and your two eyes are the clearest I've ever seen. If you will cry them out for me, I shall carry you over to the great greenhouse where Death lives and tends his trees and flowers. Each one of them is a human life.\"\n\n\"Oh, what would I not give for my child,\" said the crying mother, and she wept till her eyes dropped down to the bottom of the lake and became two precious pearls. The lake took her up as if in a swing, and swept her to the farther shore.\n\nHere stood the strangest house that ever was. It rambled for many a mile. One wouldn't know whether it was a cavernous, forested mountain, or whether it was made of wood. But the poor mother could not see this, for she had cried out her eyes.\n\n\"Where shall I find Death, who took my child from me?\" she cried.\n\n\"He has not come back yet,\" said the old woman who took care of the great greenhouse while Death was away. \"How did you find your way here? Who helped you?\"\n\n\"The Lord helped me,\" she said. \"He is merciful, and so must you be. Where can I find my child?\"\n\n\"I don't know him,\" said the old woman, \"and you can't see to find him. But many flowers and trees have withered away in the night, and Death will be along soon to transplant them. Every human being, you know, has his tree or his flower of life, depending on what sort of person he is. These look like other plants, but they have a heart that beats. A child's heart beats too. You know the beat of your own child's heart. Listen and you may hear it. But what will you give me if I tell you what else you must do?\"\n\n\"I have nothing left,\" the poor mother said, \"but I will go to the ends of the earth for you.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to do there,\" said the old woman, \"but you can give me your long black hair. You know how beautiful it is, and I like it. I'll give you my white hair for it. White hair is better than none.\"\n\n\"Is that all you ask?\" said the mother. \"I will gladly give it to you.\" And she gave her beautiful long black tresses in exchange for the old woman's white hair.\n\nThen they went into Death's great greenhouse, where flowers and trees were strangely intertwined. In one place delicate hyacinths were kept under glass bells, and around them great hardy peonies flourished. There were water plants too, some thriving where the stalks of others were choked by twisting water snakes, or gnawed away by black crayfish. Tall palm trees grew there, and plane trees, and oaks. There grew parsley and sweet-smelling thyme. Every tree or flower went by the name of one particular person, for each was the life of someone still living in China, in Greenland, or in some other part of the world. There were big trees stunted by the small pots which their roots filled to bursting, and elsewhere grew languid little flowers that came to nothing, for all the care that was lavished upon them, and for all the rich earth and the mossy carpet where they grew. The sad, blind mother bent over the tiniest plants and listened to the beat of their human hearts, and among so many millions she knew her own child's heartbeat.\n\n\"This is it,\" she cried, groping for a little blue crocus, which had wilted and dropped to one side.\n\n\"Don't touch that flower,\" the old woman said. \"Stay here. Death will be along any minute now, and you may keep him from pulling it up. Threaten him that, if he does, you will pull up other plants. That will frighten him, for he has to account for them to the Lord. Not one may be uprooted until God says so.\"\n\nSuddenly an icy wind blew through the place, and the blind mother felt Death come near.\n\n\"How did you find your way here?\" he asked her. \"How did you ever get here before me?\"\n\n\"I am a mother,\" she said.\n\nThen Death stretched out his long hand toward the wilted little flower, but she held her hands tightly around it, in terror lest he touch a single leaf. Death breathed upon her hands, and his breath was colder than the coldest wind. Her hands fell, powerless.\n\n\"You have no power to resist me,\" Death told her.\n\n\"But our Lord has,\" she said.\n\n\"I only do his will,\" said Death, \"I am His gardener. I take His flowers and trees and plant them again in the great Paradise gardens, in the unknown land. But how they thrive, and of their life there, I dare not speak.\"\n\n\"Give me back my child,\" the mother wept and implored him. Suddenly she grasped a beautiful flower in each hand and as she clutched them she called to Death: \"I shall tear out your flowers by the roots, for I am desperate.\"\n\n\"Do not touch them!\" Death told her. \"You say you are desperate, yet you would drive another mother to the same despair.\"\n\n\"Another mother!\" The blind woman's hands let go the flowers.\n\n\"Behold,\" said Death, \"you have your eyes again. I saw them shining as I crossed the lake, and fished them up, but I did not know they were yours. They are clearer than before. Take them and look deep into this well. I shall tell you the names of the flowers you were about to uproot and you shall see the whole future of those human lives that you would have destroyed and disturbed.\"\n\nShe looked into the well, and it made her glad to see how one life became a blessing to the world, for it was so kind and happy. Then she saw the other life, which held only sorrow, poverty, fear, and woe.\n\n\"Both are the will of God,\" said Death.\n\n\"Which one is condemned to misery, and which is the happy one?\" she asked.\n\n\"That I shall not tell you,\" Death said. \"But I tell you this. One of the flowers belongs to your own child. One life that you saw was your child's fate, your own child's future.\"\n\nThen the mother shrieked in terror, \"Which was my child? Tell me! Save my innocent child. Spare him such wretchedness. Better that he be taken from me. Take him to God's kingdom. Forget my tears. Forget the prayers I have said, and the things I have done.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" Death said. \"Will you take your own child back or shall I take him off to a land unknown to you?\"\n\nThen the mother wrung her hands, fell on her knees, and prayed to God:\n\n\"Do not hear me when I pray against your will. It is best. Do not listen, do not listen!\" And she bowed her head, as Death took her child to the unknown land."

      "body": "Too Much Candy:\n\nThis is one of the best Halloween stories online about Jay and his family. They are getting ready for Halloween. Jay’s mom is on the steps. She’s making a Halloween costume for Jay. Jay and his dad are decorating the front porch. There is a scarecrow on the swing, spiders in the corner, and paper bats hanging from the ceiling.\n\nNow, it is time to carve jack-o’-lantern. They cut out the top, pull out the seeds, and finally cut out the face. There are two circle eyes, a triangle nose, and three square teeth. They put the jack-o’-lantern on the table on the front porch next to a big, scary bowl of candy. But, Jay’s mom and dad tell Jay, “You can have only one piece of candy each day!” Jay is not happy.\n\nThe next morning, Jay wakes up and remembers the candy. He puts on his backpack and gets ready to go to school. As he walks out the door, he grabs a big handful of candy and runs to school. When he comes home, something is different. The jack-o’-lantern is different. The eyes are a little scarier, the nose is a little smaller and the teeth are a little sharper. “What’s happening?” Jay scratched his head.\n\nThe next morning when Jay goes to school, he takes another big handful of candy and runs to school. When he comes back, the jack-o’-lantern is even scarier. The eyes are scarier, the nose is smaller and the teeth are sharper than before. “What’s happening?” little Jay thought.\n\nThe next morning when Jay goes to school, he grabs another big handful of candy and runs to school. But when he comes home, the jack-o’-lantern is very scary. The eyes are very scary, the nose is very small and the teeth are very very sharp.\n\nThat night. Jay hears a voice, a whisper from outside, “TOO MUCH CANDY!” He gets out of bed, walks down the stairs, opens the front door, and said to himself, “Where is the jack-o’-lantern? Where is the candy?” He hears the voice again, “TOO MUCH CANDY!”\n\nJay walks down the stairs and walks to the corner and again he hears the voice, “TOO MUCH CANDY!” He walks around the corner and finds that there is nothing there.

      "body": "The Naughty Boy:\n\nOnce upon a time there was an old poet-one of those good, honest old poets. One evening, as he was sitting quietly in his home, a terrible storm broke out-the rain poured down in torrents-but the old poet sat warm and cozy in his study, for a fire blazed brightly in his stove and roasting apples sizzled and hissed beside it.\n\n\"There won't be a dry stitch on anybody out in this rain,\" he told himself. You see, he was a very kindhearted old poet.\n\n\"Oh, please open the door for me! I'm so cold and wet!\" cried a little child outside his house. Then it knocked at the door, while the rain poured down and the wind shook all the windows.\n\n\"Why, the poor little child!\" cried the old poet as he hurried to open the door. Before him stood a naked little boy, with the water streaming down from his yellow hair! He was shivering, and would certainly have perished in the storm had he not been let in.\n\n\"You poor little fellow!\" said the poet again, and took him by the hand. \"Come in, and we'll soon have you warmed up! I shall give you some wine and a roasted apple, for you're such a pretty little boy.\"\n\nAnd he really was pretty! His eyes sparkled like two bright stars, and his hair hung in lovely curls, even though the water was still streaming from it. He looked like a little angel, but he was pale with the cold and shivering in every limb. In his hand he held a beautiful little bow-and-arrow set, but the bow had been ruined by the rain, and all the colors on the arrows had run together.\n\nThe old poet quickly sat down by the stove and took the little boy on his knee. He dried the child's hair, rubbed the blue little hands vigorously, and heated some sweet wine for him. And pretty soon the little boy felt better; the roses came back to his cheeks, and he jumped down from the old man's lap and danced around the old poet.\n\n\"You're a cheerful boy,\" laughed the old man. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Cupid,\" was the reply. \"Don't you know me? There lies my bow, and I can certainly shoot with it, too. Look, the storm is over and the moon is shining!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the old poet said, \"but I'm afraid the rain has spoiled your bow.\"\n\n\"That would be a shame,\" replied the little boy as he looked the bow over carefully. \"No, it's already dry again, and the string is good and tight. No damage done. I guess I'll try it.\" Then he fitted an arrow to his bow, aimed it, and shot the good old poet right through the heart!\n\n\"Do you see now that my bow is not spoiled?\" he said laughingly, and ran out of the house. Wasn't he a naughty boy to shoot the good old poet who had been so kind to him, taken him into his warm room, and given him his delicious wine and his best apple?\n\nThe good poet lay on the floor and wept, because he really had been shot right through the heart. \"What a naughty boy that Cupid is!\" he cried. \"I must warn all the good children, so that they will be careful and never play with him. Because he will certainly do them some harm!\" So he warned all the good children, and they were very careful to keep away from that naughty Cupid.\n\nBut he is very clever and he tricks them all the time. When the students are going home from the lectures, he runs beside them, with a black coat on and a book under his arm. They don't recognize him, but they take his arm, thinking he is a student, too, and then he sends his arrows into their hearts. And when the girls are in church to be confirmed, he is likely to catch them and shoot his darts into them. Yes, he is always after people!\n\nIn the theater he sits up in the big chandelier, burning so brightly that people think he's a lamp, but they soon find out better. He runs about the king's garden and on the rampart, and once he even shot your father and mother right through the heart! Just ask them, and you'll hear what they say.\n\nYes, he's a bad boy, this Cupid-you had better never have anything to do with him, for he is after all of you. And what do you think? A long time ago he even shot an arrow into your poor old grandmother! The wound has healed up, but she will never forget it.\n\nSaucy Cupid! But now you know all about him, and what a naughty boy he is!"

      "body": "She Was Good For Nothing:\n\nThe mayor was standing at his open window; he was wearing a dress shirt with a dainty breastpin in its frill. He was very well shaven, self-done, though he had cut himself slightly and had stuck a small bit of newspaper over the cut.\n\n\"Listen, youngster!\" he boomed.\n\nThe youngster was none other than the washerwoman's son, who respectfully took off his cap as he passed. This cap was broken at the rim, so that he could put it into his pocket. In his poor but clean and very neatly mended clothes, and his heavy wooden shoes, the boy stood as respectfully as if he were before the king.\n\n\"You're a good boy, a well-behaved lad!\" said the Mayor. \"I suppose your mother is washing down at the river, and no doubt you are going to bring her what you have in your pocket. That's an awful thing with your mother! How much have you there?\"\n\n\"A half pint,\" said the boy in a low, trembling voice.\n\n\"And this morning she had the same?\" continued the Mayor.\n\n\"No, it was yesterday!\" answered the boy.\n\n\"Two halves make a whole! She is no good! It is sad there are such people. Tell your mother she ought to be ashamed of herself. Don't you become a drunkard-but I suppose you will! Poor child! Run along now.\"\n\nAnd the boy went, still holding his cap in his hand, while the wind rippled the waves of his yellow hair. He went down the street and through an alley to the river, where his mother stood at her washing stool in the water, beating the heavy linen with a wooden beater. The current was strong, for the mill's sluices were open; the bed sheet was dragged along by the stream and nearly swept away her washing stool, and the woman had all she could do to stand up against it.\n\n\"I was almost carried away,\" she said. \"It's a good thing you've come, for I need something to strengthen me. It's so cold in the water; I've been standing here for six hours. Have you brought me anything?\"\n\nThe boy drew forth a flask, and his mother put it to her lips and drank a little.\n\n\"Oh, that does me good! How it warms me! It's just as good as hot food, and it isn't as expensive! Drink, my boy! You look so pale, and you're freezing in your thin clothes. Remember it is autumn. Ooh, the water is cold! If only I don't get ill! But I won't. Give me a little more, and drink some yourself, but only a little drop, for you mustn't get used to it, my poor dear child!\"\n\nAnd she walked out of the water and up onto the bridge where the boy stood. The water dripped from the straw mat that she had tied around her waist and from her petticoat.\n\n\"I work and slave till the blood runs out at my fingernails, but I do it gladly if I can bring you up honestly, my sweet child!\"\n\nJust then came an elderly woman, poorly clad, lame in one leg, and with an enormously large, false curl hanging down over one of her eyes, which was blind. This curl was supposed to hide the eye, but it only made the defect the more conspicuous. The neighbors called her \"limping Maren with the curl,\" and she was an old friend of the washerwoman's.\n\n\"You poor thing,\" she cried, \"slaving and toiling in the cold water! You certainly need something to warm you a little, and yet the gossips cry about the few drops you take!\" And soon all that the Mayor had said to the boy was repeated to his mother, for Maren had overheard it, and it had angered her to hear him talk so to the child about his own mother and the few drops she took, because on that same day the Mayor was having a big dinner party with many bottles of wine.\n\n\"Good wine, strong wine! Many will drink more than they should, but they don't call that drinking. They are all right, but you are good for nothing!\"\n\n\"What! Did the Mayor really say that, child?\" asked the laundress, her lips quivering. \"So you have a mother who is good for nothing! Perhaps he's right, though he shouldn't say so to a child. But I mustn't complain; good things have come to me from that house.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, you were in service there, when the Mayor's parents were alive. That was many years ago. Many bushels of salt have been eaten since then, so people may well be thirsty! laughed Maren. \"The big dinner today at the Mayor's would have been postponed if everything hadn't been prepared. I heard the news from the porter. A letter came, an hour ago, telling them that the Mayor's younger brother, in Copenhagen, is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" cried the laundress, turning as white as a ghost.\n\n\"What does it matter to you\" said Maren. \"Of course, you must have known him, since you worked in the house.\"\n\n\"Is he really dead? He was the best and kindest of men-indeed, there aren't many like him!\" Tears were rolling down her cheeks. \"Oh, my God! Everything is going around! That's because I emptied the bottle. I couldn't stand so much. I feel so ill!\" And she leaned against the fence for support.\n\n\"Good heavens, you are ill, indeed!\" said Maren. \"Try to get over it! No, you really are sick! I'd better get you home!\"\n\n\"But the washing there!\"\n\n\"I'll take care of that. Here, give me your arm. The boy can stay here and watch it till I come back and wash what's left. It's only a few pieces.\"\n\nThe poor laundress' legs were trembling under her. \"I've stood too long in the cold water, with no food since yesterday! I have a burning fever. Oh, dear Lord Jesus, help me to get home! Oh, my poor child!\" And she wept.\n\nThe boy cried too, as he sat alone beside the river, guarding the wet linen. The two women made their way slowly, the washerwoman dragging her shaky limbs up the little alley and through the street where the Mayor lived. Just as she reached the front of his house, she sank down on the cobblestones. A crowd gathered around her.\n\nLimping Maren ran into his yard for help. The Mayor and his guests came to the windows.\n\n\"It's the washerwoman!\" he said. \"She's had a bit too much to drink; she's no good! It's a pity for that handsome boy of hers, I really like that child, but his mother is good for nothing.\"\n\nAnd the washerwoman was brought to her own humble room, where she was put to bed. Kindly Maren hastened to prepare a cup of warm ale with butter and sugar-she could think of no better medicine in such a case-and then returned to the river, where, although she meant well, she did a very poor job with the washing; she only pulled the wet clothes out of the water and put them into a basket.\n\nThat evening she appeared again in the washerwoman's miserable room. She had begged from the Mayor's cook a couple of roasted potatoes and a fine fat piece of ham for the sick woman. Maren and the boy feasted on these, but the patient was satisfied with the smell, \"For that was very nourishing,\" she said.\n\nThe boy was put to bed, in the same one in which his mother slept, lying crosswise at his mother's feet, with a blanket of old blue and red carpet ends sewed together.\n\nThe laundress felt a little better now; the warm ale had given her strength, and the smell of the good food had been nourishing.\n\n\"Thank you, my kind friend,\" she said to Maren, \"I'll tell you all about it, while the boy is asleep. He's sleeping already; see how sweet he looks with his eyes closed. He doesn't think of his mother's sufferings; may our Lord never let him feel their equal! Well, I was in service at the Councilor's, the Mayor' parents, when their youngest son came home from his studies. I was a carefree young girl then, but honest-I must say that before heaven. And the student was so pleasant and jolly; every drop of blood in his veins was honest and true; a better young man never lived. He was a son of the house, and I was only a servant, but we became sweethearts-all honorably; a kiss is no sin, after all, if people really love each other. And he told his mother that he loved me. She was an angel in his eyes, wise and kind and loving. And when he went away again he put his gold ring on my finger.\n\n\"After he had gone my mistress called me in to speak to me; she looked so grave and yet so kind, and spoke as wisely as an angel indeed. She pointed out to me the gulf of difference, both mentally and materially, that lay between her son and me. 'Now he is attracted by your good looks, but that will fade in time. You haven't received his education; intellectually you can never rise to his level. I honor the poor,' she continued, ' and I know that there is many a poor man who will sit in a higher seat in the kingdom of heaven than many a rich man; but that is no reason for crossing the barrier in this world. Left to yourselves, you two would drive your carriage full tilt against obstacles, until it toppled over with you both. Now I know that Erik, the glovemaker, a good, honest craftsman, wants to marry you; he is a well-to-do widower with no children. Think it over!'\n\n\"Every word my mistress spoke went through my heart like a knife, but I knew she was right, and that weighed heavily upon me. I kissed her hand, and my bitter tears fell upon it. But still bitterer tears fell when I lay upon my bed in my own room. Oh, the long, dreary night that followed-our Lord alone knows how I suffered!\n\n\"Not until I went to church on Sunday did peace of mind come after my pain. It seemed the working of Providence that as I left the church I met Erik himself. There were no doubts in my mind now; we were suited to each other, both in rank and in means; he was even a well-to-do man. So I went straight up to him, took his hand, and asked, 'Do you still think of me?'\n\n\" 'Yes, always and forever,' he said.\n\n\" 'Do you want to marry a girl who likes and respects you, but does not love you?'\n\n\" 'I believe love will come,' he said, and then we joined hands.\n\n\"I went home to my mistress. The gold ring that her son had given me I had been wearing every day next to my heart, and every night on my finger in bed, but now I drew it out. I kissed it until my lips bled, then gave it to my mistress and told her that next week the banns would be read for me and the glovemaker.\n\n\"My mistress took me in her arms and kissed me; she didn't say I was good for nothing, but at that time I was perhaps better than I am now, for I had not yet known the misfortunes of the world. The wedding was at Candlemas, and for our first year we were quite happy. My husband had a workman and an apprentice with him, and you, Maren, were our servant.\"\n\n\"Oh, and such a good mistress you were!\" said Maren. \"I shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to me!\"\n\n\"Ah, but you were with us during our good times! We had no children then. I never saw the student again. Oh, yes, I saw him once, but he didn't see me. He came to his mother's funeral, and I saw him standing by her grave, looking so sad and pale-but that was all for his mother's sake. When his father died later he was abroad and didn't come to that funeral. He didn't come here again; he became a lawyer, and he never married, I know. But he thought no more of me, and if he had seen me he would certainly have never recognized me, ugly as I am now. And it is all for the best!\"\n\nThen she went on to tell of the bitter days of hardship, when misfortune had fallen upon them. They had saved five hundred dollars, and since in their neighborhood a house could be bought for two hundred, they considered it a good investment to buy one, tear it down, and build again. So the house was bought, and the bricklayers and carpenters estimated that the new house would cost a thousand and twenty dollars. Erik had credit and borrowed that sum in Copenhagen, but the captain who was to have brought the money was shipwrecked and the money lost.\n\n\"It was just then that my darling boy, who lies sleeping there, was born. Then his father had a long and severe illness, and for nine months I even had to dress and undress him every day. We kept on going backward. We had to borrow more and more; one by one all our possessions were sold; and at last Erik died. Since then I have worked and slaved for the boy's sake, have gone out scrubbing floors and washing linen, done coarse work or fine, whatever I could get. But I was not to be better off; it is the Lord's will! He will take me away and find better provisions for my child.\" Then she fell asleep.\n\nIn the morning she seemed better and decided she was strong enough to return to her work. But the moment she felt the cold water a shivering seized her; she grasped about convulsively with her hands, took one step forward, and fell. Her head lay on the dry bank, but her feet were in the water of the river; her wooden shoes, in each of which there was a handful of straw, were carried away by the current.\n\nAnd here she was found by Maren, when she came to bring her some coffee.\n\nA message had come to her lodging that the Mayor wanted to see her, for he had something to say to her. It was too late. A doctor was summoned; the poor washerwoman was dead.\n\n\"She has drunk herself to death,\" said the Mayor.\n\nThe letter that had brought the Mayor the news of his brother's death also gave a summary of his will, and among other bequests he had left six hundred dollars to the glovemaker's widow, who had formerly served his parents! The money was to be paid at discretion in large or small sums to her and her child.\n\n\"There was some nonsense about love between my brother and her,\" said the Mayor. \"It's just as well she's out of the way. Now it will all come to the boy, and I'll place him with some honest people who will make him a good workman.\" And on these words our Lord laid his blessings.\n\nAnd the Mayor sent for the boy, promised to take care of him, and told him it was a lucky thing his mother was dead; she was good for nothing.\n\nThey carried her to the churchyard, to a pauper's grave. Maren planted a little rose tree on her grave, while the boy stood beside her.\n\n\"My darling mother,\" he said as the tears started from his eyes. \"Is it true that she was good for nothing?\"\n\n\"No, it is not true!\" said the old woman, looking up to heaven. \"I have known it for many years and especially since the night before she died. I tell you she was a good and fine woman, and our Lord in heaven will say so, too, so let the world say: 'She was good for nothing!' \""

      "body": "The Puppet-show Man:\n\nOn board the steamer was an elderly man with such a joyful face that if it didn't belie him he must have been the happiest person on earth. In fact, he said he was the happiest; I heard it from his own mouth. He was a Dane, a countryman of mine, and a traveling theatrical producer. His whole company was with him and lay in a large box, for he was the proprietor of a puppet show. He said that his natural cheerfulness had been enlightened by a Polytechnic student, and the experiment had left him completely happy. At first I didn't understand what he meant, but later he explained the whole thing to me, and here is the story.\n\n\"In the town of Slagelse,\" he said, \"I gave a performance in the post-office courtyard before a brilliant audience, all juvenile except for two old matrons. Suddenly a person in black, looking like a student, entered the hall and sat down; he laughed at the right places and applauded appropriately. He was an unusual spectator. I was anxious to know who he was, and I learned that he was a student from the Polytechnic Institute of Copenhagen who had been sent out to teach the people in the provinces. My performance ended promptly at eight o'clock, for children must go to bed early, and a manager must consider the convenience of his public. At nine o'clock the student began his lecture and experiments, and now I was one of his spectators. It was all extraordinary to hear and see. \n\nMost of it went over my head and into the parson's, as one says, but it made me think that if we mortals can learn so much we must surely be intended to last longer than the little span we're here on earth. What he performed were miracles, and though only small ones, everything was done as easily as a foot fits into a stocking, as naturally as nature functions. In the days of Moses and the prophets such a man would have been counted among the wise men of the land; in the Middle Ages he would have been burned at the stake. I didn't sleep that whole night. And the next evening, when I gave another performance, and the student was again present, I was in an exuberantly good humor. I once heard from an actor that when he played the part of a lover he always thought of one particular lady in the audience; he played only to her and forgot the rest of the house. Now the Polytechnic student was my 'she,' my only spectator, for whom alone I performed.\n\n\"After the performance, when the puppets had taken their curtain calls, the Polytechnic student invited me into his room to have a glass of wine; he spoke of my plays, and I spoke of his science, and I think we were equally pleased. But I had the better of it, for there was much of what he did that he couldn't explain to me. For instance, a piece of iron that falls through a spiral becomes magnetic. Now why does that happen? The spirit enters it, but where does it come from? \n\nIt is just as it is with the humans in our world, I think; our Lord lets them fall through the spiral line of time; the spirit enters them, and there then stands a Napoleon, a Luther, or some such person. 'The whole world is a series of miracles,' said the student, 'but we're so used to them that we call them everyday things.' And he continued talking and explaining until finally my skull seemed lifted from my brain, and I honestly confessed that if I weren't already an old fellow I would at once attend the Polytechnic Institute and learn to examine the world more closely, even though I was one of the happiest of men.\n\n\" 'One of the happiest!' said the student, and seemed to be quite thoughtful about it. 'Are you really happy?' he asked me.\n\n\" 'Yes,' I said, 'I am happy. All the towns welcome me whenever I come with my company. But I do, to be sure, have one wish, which sometimes haunts me like a goblin- a nightmare that rides on my good nature. I should like to be a real theatrical manager, director of a troupe of real men and women!'\n\n\" 'You wish your puppets would come to life; you wish they would become real actors,' he said, 'and you would be their director; and then would you be completely happy, you think?' He didn't believe it, but I believed it, and we talked back and forth about it, without coming any nearer a solution; still we clinked glasses together, and the wine was excellent. \n\nThere must have been some magic in it, for otherwise the story would have been that I got drunk. That didn't happen, though; I kept my clear viewpoint. Somehow there was sunlight in the room, and it shone from the face of the Polytechnic student. It made me think of the old tales of the gods in their eternal youth, when they wandered on earth. I told him that, and he smiled. I could have sworn that he was one of the old gods in disguise, or at least that he belonged to their family! And he certainly must have been something of that sort, for my greatest wish was to be fulfilled; the puppets would come to life, and I would be the director of real people. We drank to that.\n\n\"He packed all my puppets into a wooden box, strapped it on my back, and then let me fall through a spiral. I can still hear how I tumbled; and then I was lying on the floor-this is positively true-and the whole company sprang from the box! The spirit had come upon all of them; all the puppets had become great artists-at least, so they said-and I was their director. Everything was ready for the first performance. But the whole company wanted to speak to me, and the public, too.\n\n\"The prima ballerina said that the 'house' was going to 'fall' if she didn't stand on one leg in the show; she was mistress of the whole company, and insisted on being treated as such. The lady who played the empress wanted to be treated as an empress off stage, or else she would get out of practice. The man who had only to deliver a letter made himself as important as the leading man, for the little parts were just as important as the big ones, and all were of equal consequence in making up an artistic whole, he said. The hero would play only parts composed of nothing but exit lines, because those brought him the applause.\n\n The prima donna would only play act in a red light, for that suited her best; she refused to appear in a blue one. They were like a troupe of flies in a bottle, and I was in the middle of the bottle with them, for I was the director. My breath stopped, and my head was dizzy; I was as miserable as a man can be. It was quite a new kind of people among whom I found myself now. I only wished I had them all back in their box and that I had never been a director at all. I told them straight out that they were all nothing but puppets-and so they killed me!\n\n\"I found myself lying on my bed in my room; how I got there, or how I got away from the Polytechnic student, he may know-I don't. The moon shone in on the floor where the box lay overturned, and all the dolls, great and small, were scattered about in confusion; but I wasn't idle. I jumped out of bed and popped them all back into the box, some on their heads and some on their feet; then I slammed down the lid, and seated myself on the box. It was a picture worth painting! Can't you just see it? I can! 'Now you'll just have to stay in there,' I said. 'And I'll never again wish that you have flesh and blood!' I was in such a relieved frame of mind, I was the happiest of men. The Polytechnic student had entirely purified me. I sat there in a state of utter contentment and fell asleep on the box.\n\n\"The next morning-it was really noon, for I slept wonderfully late that day-I was still sitting there, lighthearted, and conscious that my one former wish had been foolish. I asked for the Polytechnic student, but he was gone, like the gods of Greece and Rome; and since that time I have been the happiest of men. I am a happy director; my company never grumbles, or my public either-they're amused to their hearts' content. I can put my plays together just as I like, taking out of other plays anything that pleases me, and no one is annoyed at it. Plays that nowadays are disdained in the big theaters, but that the public ran to see, and wept over, thirty years ago-those plays I now put on. I perform them for the little ones, and the little ones weep just as Papa and Mamma did. I give them Johanne Montsaucon andDyveke, but in abbreviated versions, for the youngsters don't want long-winded love stories; what they want is something sad but short.\n\n\"I have traveled through Denmark from one end to the other; I know everyone there, and everyone knows me. Now I'm on my way to Sweden, and if I'm successful there and make good money, I'll be a man of Scandinavia; otherwise I won't. I tell you this because you are my countryman.\"\n\nAnd I, as his countryman, in turn naturally tell it - just for the sake of telling it."

      "body": "The Farmer And The Seeds:\n\nA long time ago, many people had gathered around Jesus to hear his words of wisdom. Jesus told the crowd a story about a farmer.\n\nJesus said, “Once upon a time, there was a farmer who walked up and down the fields while scattering seeds all around. The seeds fell at different places. Some fell on the path and the birds came and ate them up. Some fell on the rocks where the plants grew for a very short time and then died in the heat of the sun. \n\nSome seeds fell on the thorns which grew faster than the plants. Thus, choking them completely. But some fell on good and rich fertile soil where they grew well, giving the farmer a good crop. This way, he could easily see the difference between the path, rocks, thorns, and rich fertile land.”\n\nAfter finishing the story to the crowd, Jesus explained, “God’s words are like seeds. People often hear what God says but the devil earns their heart. So, the words are not able to enter their hearts!” He compared the shallow hearts of many men to the rocky ground which hears God’s words with joy but does not remember them for long.\n\nHe also compared the thorns with those people who hear the words of God but are much more interested in worldly things around them. And they slowly, over time forget the words of God. But there are some people who believed in God’s words. These people grow like the seeds on fertile soil, giving a strong and good harvest of faith. Goodness and lots of love are filled in their hearts."

I can fly the highest.” Off he went into the clouds but eagle could not fly high enough.\n\nThe monkey chattered, “I can climb into the sky!” Off he went to the trees, but the monkey could not climb high enough. “Me!” called the elephant. “Me!” called all the big animals, but all of them failed. Finally, Anansi, the spider came forward and said, “I can spin away up into the sky.” King Lion laughed at him and said, “You are too little!” “I may be tiny,” Anansi replied, “but my friends and I can do anything if we work together!” All the animals laughed but King Lion roared, “Get off! We shall see what Anansi and his friends can do!”\n\nAnansi called out, “Ant and fly, let’s go!”, he began to weave a web from the Earth. It stretched high into the clouds and Anansi and his friends climbed up towards the sky Kingdom. After climbing a lot, they finally reached the last cloud. It was surrounded by bright light and beautiful colors. \n\nSuddenly, the King of the sky stood in front of them. “What do you want here?” the King asked. “We have come for light, King! Will you please share it with the Earth below!” The King agreed but he wanted to see how worthy Anansi was. The King had given three tests. The first test was to cut down every blade of grass in the huge field before sunrise tomorrow. Anansi thought for a while and ordered his friend ant to tell his family so that it could be chopped overnight. Together, all the ants cut down the grass blades and the first task was completed.\n\nThe second condition was to eat all the fruits from a huge field. Anansi thought for a while and commanded the fly, “Go to the Earth and tell all the fly family to eat the fruits as fast as they could!” When the King of the sky saw the fruits the next morning, it was all vanished. The King of the sky was now very furious and decided to give the toughest task.\n\nThe King of the sky went to his tent and decided to offer two boxes. One of them was a tiny silver box and the other one was a very big box of gold. The fly, as always overheard the King and told Anansi to choose the tiny silver box. Anansi, as decided chose the box and the King of sky sent them back to the Earth.\n\nWhen they reached back, the presented the tiny silver box to the King of the jungle. As they opened the box, a rooster appeared. When she said, “Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!” the sun appeared. From then on, the Earth never faced the darkness without light.

Now, every day, after the dog helped the farmer with his daily things, he went to sit by the highway. The dog loved the road.\n\nEvery day, without fail he would sit by the highway and wait for cars to pass by. And whenever he saw a car, he would chase after it. After a while, he’d come back, his tongue out due to all the running and wait again. He would stay there, quietly waiting for another car to come.\n\nThe moment he saw another car, he would chase after it again. He did this repeatedly, car after car and day after day.  The dog would return to the farm in the evenings and go to the highway the next day after his daily duties.\n\nOne day, one of the farmer’s friends came to visit the farmer. He was astonished to see the dog chase cars. So, he asked the farmer, “Do you think he will ever catch one?” The farmer shook his head and said, “That doesn’t bother me at all. But the thing I am worried about is, what would he do with the car if he ever did catch one.”\n\nWe humans, most of the times, act as the farmer’s dog. We set a goal, without much thinking. And then we follow them with all our soul and powers, but what we do not think about is whether the goal we have set is of any worth or not. We usually set meaningless goals, and only when we get there, we realize all that hard work was for nought. Therefore, we should think more carefully. \n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: WE SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE DECIDING SOMETHING, BECAUSE WE MAY BE STUCK WITH THE REPERCUSSIONS FOR OUR WHOLE LIVES."

Even the birds would come by his window to listen to him play.\n\nOrpheus lived with his wife, Eurydice who loved him very deeply. Orpheus was also madly in love with Eurydice. They really were made for each other.\n\nOne day though, while Eurydice was picking flowers in the woods, a snake bit her. She died at once. The life of Orpheus changed completely. He was so sad he could no longer play the lyre.\n\nOne day, he decided to take an action. “I will go to Hades, the God of the underworld, and get Eurydice back,” he said to his friends. But the underworld had many dangers and no one had ever returned from there. But Orpheus had his mind set and there he went to Hades with his lyre.\n\nWhen he reached the River of Death, he asked the boatman to carry him to the other side of the River. The boatman refused. “Only the dead can pass,” he said to Orpheus. But Orpheus started to play his lyre. The boatman was so overwhelmed that he agreed to take Orpheus to the other side of the River.\n\nReaching the gate of Hades, Orpheus found a three-headed dog, the fierce Cerberus. Quickly Orpheus started to play his lyre again and Cerberus was magically enchanted allowing Orpheus to sneak in. There, Orpheus met Hades and Persephone, the King and Queen of the Underworld who were surprised to see him. “What are you doing here, mortal?” Hades asked.\n\nWhile playing his lyre, Orpheus told Hades how much he loved Eurydice. “You, Hades, once fell in love with your wife too,” Orpheus pointed out. “Since everybody dies you’ll get our soul back anyway,” he continued, “so why not let Eurydice live for a few more years?” Hades and Persephone were touched by Orpheus’ words and music and agreed to free Eurydice.\n\nBut there was one condition. “As a token of your belief in me, Eurydice must walk behind you as you travel back to the upper world,” Hades said, “and you must not look back at Eurydice until you have exited the Underworld.” Orpheus agreed.\n\nThe couple began their ascent. Orpheus felt tentative as he didn’t know whether he could trust Hades. Soon he could see the exit. Orpheus stepped out of the cave and into the light but just as he was out, he turned back to confirm if Eurydice was indeed behind him.\n\nOrpheus had disobeyed Hades and the only thing Orpheus heard was a fading “I love you!” as Eurydice was pulled back to the Underworld. He spent his remaining days among birds and trees playing the most beautiful music ever heard.\n\nSome say the spirits of Orpheus and Eurydice ended up finding each other after many years and are still together."

      "body": "The Difference A Good Teacher Makes:\n\nI have been teaching for four years now. I am a tenth-grade English teacher. Needless to say, I love my subject and vowed to one day impart my love of literature to my future students. Well, I must admit, I have made more than a difference, I have changed the way students perceive literature and have even inspired some to become English teachers.\n\nI have received countless thank-you cards, gifts, letters and certificates in appreciation for my time and effort and I hope compassion. If I could pick one or two students with whom I have come to love as my own, that would be difficult. There have been several students each year who stand out and a lasting bond between us is formed.\n\nOne student in particular, however, is named John Doe. I met him last year when he was a student in my English class during eighth period. He has expressive brown eyes that light up his face. He sat in the back often, saying very little. However, I sensed that he was taking in all that I taught. John was never absent nor was he late. He was a mild mannered student who seemed very mature for his age.\n\nHe was a mild mannered student who seemed very mature for his age.\n\nAs the year progressed, we read lots of poetry and various stories about different cultures and real-life experiences. I have always wanted literature to speak to my students so that they could find relevant connections which would ultimately give them that motivation to read, write and interpret. While reading and writing poetry, John had written some beautiful poetry that spoke of his experiences as a black male in America. I was delighted and surprised that he could write poetry so well. Of course, there was some editing to be done, but he was inspired and encouraged to write about what mattered to him.\n\nOn the last day of school, students were asked to write a brief autobiographical essay and to dedicate it to someone he or she thought was significant in his or her life.\n\nNeedless to say, John dedicated his essay to me and used clip art that decorated the dedication with roses.\n\nHe stated in the essay that “some people you meet in life are flowers, but then there are those who are roses. Ms. Hopkins, I just wanted you to know that you are a rose in my life and I have enjoyed every minute of being in your class. If you thought that sometimes I had zoned out, well, you were wrong. I would never zone out on a teacher such as you. You have shown me that I have purpose in life and that I am a poet. I will never forget you.” Needless to say, tears streamed down my eyes and eyeliner was everywhere. But John’s words touched me in such a profound and emotional way. I had had a particularly hard personal life that year and somehow that letter made it worth the struggle.\n\nI needed to hear those words and I told John that his words were nourishment for a very fragile and weary soul.\n\nNow, I see John probably twice or sometimes three times a week. He visits as much as possible and tells me how much he misses my classroom and my superb ability to teach from a real-life perspective. Making a significant contribution to someone’s life is something money could never buy. Teaching allows teachers to make a positive difference in the life of someone. Thank you God for allowing me to teach."

      "body": "Sir Cleges And The Christmas Cherries:\n\n In the time when England was ruled by King Uther Pendragon, father of the famous King Arthur lived a brave knight. His name was Sir Cleges. He was big and strong. Sir Cleges was noble, courageous and extremely generous. He owned many lands and had a huge fortune.\n\nUnfortunately, as time passed Sir Cleges lost all his money due to his generosity. To the poor, Sir Cleges gave away as much gold as he could, forgave the rents for his tenants who had a hard time and he lent money to people without expecting any repayment. He had a beautiful wife, Dame Clarys. She was as kind and generous as her husband.\n\nEvery year on Christmas Eve, Sir Cleges and his wife hosted a grand feast at their house. Many people attended this feast and no one would leave empty-handed. Over the years, his wealth dwindled but he never gave up on his feasts and gifts. At last, he mortgaged all his lands when his gold and silver ran out. He knew, in the end, God would make things right for him.\n\nIn the end, he was only left with a small estate that held little value. His wife and his two children lived humbly without any luxuries. This Christmas, he had no money for his feasts and gifts. As he walked through his house, Sir Cleges felt miserable. He could hear the music and the happy laughs. “Oh Jesus in Heaven, I thank you with all my heart” he cried out suddenly, “for the joy I felt during this time for years when I hosted the feasts to rich and poor in your name. Those who dined at my table were short of nothing.”\n\nOn Christmas day, Sir Cleges walked outside his house. He knew that even though his situation was bad, there were many others who were suffering as well. He sat down under his favorite cherry tree and wondered if there was a way to help people even in his current state. As he sat under the tree, he heard the rustling of the leaves.\n\nHe looked up and saw that the cherry tree was in full bloom, even on this cold winter day. He became very happy and picked out a few cherries and took some home.\n\nHis wife indeed was happy to see ripe cherries in winter. “Cherries in winter!” she exclaimed. She suggested offering some to the king, “I hear he is at Cardiff Castle presently. I am sure he would be amazed to see cherries in Christmas time.”\n\nSir Cleges agreed with his wife’s plan. He went outside and picked out the very best cherries from the tree and decided to go to Castle Cardiff. Halfway to the Castle, he realized he was not dressed properly. His clothes were dirty and had holes in them. He was disappointed, he thought the king may not receive an ill-dressed man. “I shall go even if I am not dressed like a knight. After all, I still am one.”\n\nHe was stopped at the castle gate, “Who are you? What business do you have?” asked the guard. “Good day, Sir,” replied Sir Cleges humbly, “I am a knight of his Majesty’s realm. I am here to offer this basket of cherries to the king.”\n\nThe guard demanded a payment if Sir Cleges wanted to enter the castle. Sir Cleges was poor, he tried to convince the guard, but the guard would not listen. Finally, the guard said to Sir Cleges, “Whatever reward you receive from the king, I shall have one-third of it.”\n\nSo, it was agreed and Sir Cleges entered the castle. Inside the castle, Sir Cleges was stopped yet again, this time by the guard of the castle keep. He too asked for a payment for Sir Cleges’ entry. Again Sir Cleges expressed his inability to pay, but the guard would not hear of it. He, like the castle gate’s guard, demanded one-third of the reward Sir Cleges would receive.\n\nAfter an agreement, Sir Cleges was allowed to pass. Shortly after, he has stopped again and another guard demanded one-third of the reward. To this, Sir Cleges agreed and was finally allowed into the king’s hall.\n\nOnce inside the hall, Sir Cleges offered the basket of ripe cherries to the king. “Miracle! It truly is a miracle,” the king cried in surprise. “Cherries in winter! Join us for dinner, Sir Cleges,” the king said as he passed on the basket of cherries to everyone present in the hall.\n\nAfter the dinner was done, the king asked what present did Sir Cleges want. “I have only one wish, your highness,” said the poor knight. “If it pleases your highness, I shall like the permission to give twelve strokes to any person of my liking with my stick.” The king was surprised at the request but granted it the same.\n\nWhen the third guard saw Sir Cleges come out of the king’s hall he demanded his promised share. Sir Cleges immediately hit him with his stick four times in a row. This sent the guard running away. The same thing happened with the second guard and the third guard as well.\n\nWhen Sir Cleges was about to leave the castle, a guard came running to him. “The king has summoned you to his hall,” Sir Cleges was told. Finally, the kind had remembered Cleges. He asked why was he in such a poor state and expressed his desire to know more about Cleges’ request.\n\nSir Cleges then, narrated the incidents. After Sir Cleges was done retelling the tale, King Pendragon laughed and said, “You have earned another reward, clever Sir Cleges. You shall have new lands and the control of this castle. But you must promise to be wise with your money.”\n\nAnd so, Sir Cleges made his promise to his king and returned home a wealthy and happy man."

      "body": "Eklavyas Loyalty:\n\nThis is the story of a long-gone era. In the country of India, nearly five thousand years back, lived a boy named Eklavya, the son of a tribal chief in the forests of the kingdom- Hastinapura. Eklavya was a brave, handsome boy. He was loved by all. But he was not happy. His father saw that something troubled Eklavya. More than once he found his son lost deep in thought when other boys enjoyed the pleasures of hunting and playing.\n\nOne day the father asked his son, Why are you so unhappy, Eklavya? Why don t you join your friends? Why are you not interested in hunting? Father, I want to be an archer replied Eklavya, I want to become a disciple of the great Dronacharya, the great tutor of Archery in Hastinapura. His Gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors. Eklavya saw his father was silent. He continued, Father, I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. \n\nSo please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of Dronacharya. Eklavya’s father was troubled, for he knew that his son s ambition was not an easy one. But the chief was a loving father and he did not want to refuse his only son s wish. So the kind man gave his blessings and sent his son on his way to Drona s Gurukul. Eklavya set on his way. Soon he reached the part of the forest where Drona taught the princes of Hastinapur. In those days, there was no such system as a school, college, university or hostel. \n\nThe only place where one could get some education was a Gurukul . A Gurukul (Guru refers to teacher or master, Kul refers to his domain, from the Sanskrit word kula, meaning extended family.) is a type of ancient Hindu school in India that is residential in nature with the shishyas or students and the guru or teacher living in proximity, many a time within the same house. The Gurukul is the place where the students resided together as equals, irrespective of their social standing. \n\nThe students learned from the guru and also helped the guru in his day-to-day life, including the carrying out of mundane chores such as washing clothes,  cooking, etc. The education imparted thus, was a wholesome one. Having said this much, let us now return to Eklavya. When the boy reached Dronacharya s Gurukul, he saw that it consisted of a group of huts, surrounded by trees and an archery yard. The disciples were practicing to shoot arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. It was an engaging sight. But Eklavya s eyes searched Drona. Where was he? Will he be able to see the man? Without Drona, all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless. \n\nBut all his worries soon subsided. He did not have to wait for long. There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy, who was none else than the third Pandava prince Arjuna, as Eklavya came to know later. Though Eklavya had never seen Drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near Drona and bowed. \n\nThe sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? he asked. Dronacharya, I am Eklavya, son of the Tribal Chief in the western part of the forests of Hastinapura. Eklavya replied. Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of Archery. Drona sighed. Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a Shudra, the lowest social community according to the Vedic Caste System. I am a Brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a Shudra boy he said. \n\nAnd he’s also a Royal teacher, interrupted Prince Arjuna. Our Guru has been appointed by the King to train us, the princes and the highborn. How dare you come inside the Gurukul and seek him? Leave! NOW! he spat  out, looking enraged that Eklavya had disturbed his practice. Eklavya was stunned at Arjuna’s behavior. He himself was the son of the chief of his clan, but he never insulted anyone below him in such a way.\n\nHe looked at Drona for some kind of support, but the sage remained silent. The message was loud and clear.\n\nDronacharya also wanted him to leave. He refused to teach him. The innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by Drona’s refusal to teach him. It’s not fair! he thought miserably. God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind. He left the place with a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth. \n\nBut it could not shatter his ambition to learn Archery. He was still as determined to learn Archery. I may be a Shudra but does it make any difference? thought he.  I am as strong and zealous as Drona’s princes and disciples. If I practice the art everyday, I can surely become an archer. Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river.\n\nHe made a statue of Dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his Guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his Guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his Guru. Day\nafter day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of Drona and started practice. In time faith, courage  and perseverance transformed Eklavya the mere tribal hunter into Eklavya the extraordinary archer. Eklavya  became an archer of exceptional prowess, superior even to Drona’s best pupil, Arjuna. One day while Eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. \n\nAt first the boy ignored the dog, but continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, Eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog’s mouth without injuring it. \n\nAs a result it roamed the forests with its mouth opened. But Eklavya was not alone in his practice. He was unaware of the fact that just some distance away, the Pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. As fate would have it, that day, they had come with their teacher, Drona, who was instructing them about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the stuffed dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too.\n\nSuch an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer. he exclaimed. He told the Pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was Eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him. Your aim is truly remarkable! Drona praised Eklavya, and asked From whom did you learn Archery?\n\nEklavya was thrilled to hear Drona’s praises. How surprised he will be if he told Drona that he, in fact was his Guru! From you my Master. You are my Guru, Eklavya replied humbly. Your Guru? How can I be your Guru? I have never seen you before! Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his Gurukul several months ago. \n\nNow I remember, said he. Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my Gurukul some months back? Yes, Dronacharya, replied the boy. After I left your Gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshipped it every day. I practiced before your image. You refused to teach me, but your statue did not. \n\nThanks to it, I have become a good archer. Hearing this, Arjuna became angry. But you promised me that you’d make me the best archer in the world! he accused Drona. Now how can that be? Now a common hunter has become better than me! The other princes remembered their master frequently praising Arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest  archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. \n\nWhat will their teacher do now? Unable to answer Arjuna’s question, Drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to Prince Arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with Eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish Eklavya. Where is your guru dakhsina? You have to give me a gift for your training, the sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make Eklavya suffer for his disobedience.\n\nEklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina was the voluntary fee or gift offered by a disciple to his guru at the end of his training. The guru-shishya parampara, i.e. the teacher-student tradition, was a hallowed tradition in Hinduism. At the end of a shishya’s study, the guru asks for a guru dakshina, since a guru does not\ntake fees. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all.\n\nDronacharya, I’ll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. Ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina he said. I might ask something you don’t like to give me. What if you refuse  the dhakshina I want? Drona asked cunningly.\n\nEklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru’s dakshina was refused. No!\n\nHow can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I’ll never refuse anything you ask, Dronacharya, promised the unsuspecting boy.\nDrona did not wait anymore. Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina he declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even Arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy?\n\nFor a moment Eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. Ok Gurudev, as you wish. said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, Eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb!\n\nThe princes gasped at Eklavya’s act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain, and held out his severed thumb to Dronacharya.\n\nHere is my guru dakshina, Drona, Ekalavya said. I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I’m a mere Shudra hunter.\n\nThe sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. Eklavya, even with out your thumb, you’ll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru, Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to Arjuna was not broken. The Gods blessed Eklavya from above.\n\nBut despite his handicap, Eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, Eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When Drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness.\n\nAnd true to Drona’s blessing, Eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of Mahabharatha.\n    \nMoral: Any knowledge Teacher gives to Student has value in life of a Student as he goes on with life.\nThink from Kindergarten till highest level of study you have completed, see what you will be left with if there\n were no teachers in your life. Parents give us life, love and help in going right direction, But Teachers\n        show us how to live life, shows us path and makes us self dependable so that we can pick the right path.\n        Always respect your teachers, do not value them any lesser than your parents. When student succeeds in\n        studies and life, its student who always gets praised by People, not the one who gave student a knowledge to\n        success. Teacher’s Happiness is in student’s success, and student should not forget to at least\n        thank politely to the one who made you capable of following journey of life. And if you had learned what\n        your teacher taught you with dedication and respect to towards teacher, journey of life always gets comfortable."

      "body": "Little Tuck:\n\nYes, that was little Tuck. As a matter of fact, his name wasn't really Tuck, but before he could speak plainly he called himself Tuck. That was supposed to mean \" Carl,\" but \"Tuck\" does just as well if one only knows it.\n\nNow he had to learn his lessons and at the same time take care of his sister Gustava, who was much smaller than he; and it was pretty hard to manage the two things at once. So the poor boy sat with his little sister on his lap, and sang to her all the songs he knew, at the same time glancing into his geography book, which was open before him. By the next morning he was supposed to know all the towns in the counties of Seeland by heart, and everything there was to know about them.\n\nThen his mother returned, for she had been away, and took little Gustava herself. Tuck ran quickly to the window and studied until he almost read his eyes out, for it was getting darker and darker, and his poor mother could not afford candles.\n\nSuddenly his mother looked out of the window. \"There goes the old washerwoman from down the lane,\" she said. \"She can hardly drag herself along, and she has to carry a pail of water from the well, too! Be a good boy, Tuck, and run over and help the old woman.\"\n\nAnd little Tuck jumped up and ran to help the old woman, but when he got home again it was quite dark. Nothing was said about candles, so all he could do was go to bed-and his bed was an old folding bench. He lay there thinking about Seeland, and his geography lesson, and everything the teacher had said. He should certainly have studied that lesson some more, but of course he couldn't do that now.\n\nSo he put his geography book under his pillow, because he had heard that this helps a great deal when you want to learn a lesson. But you can't depend on that!\n\nThere he lay, thinking and thinking, then all of a sudden it seemed as if someone kissed his eyes and lips. He slept and yet he didn't sleep, and he felt as if the old washerwoman was looking at him out of the kind eyes and saying, \"It would be a great shame if you didn't know your lesson tomorrow. You helped me, and now I'll help you; and our Lord will help us both.\"\n\nThen all at once the book under his pillow began to wriggle and squirm around!\n\n\"Kekelikee! Cluck, cluck!\" It was a hen that came crawling out-and she was from Kjöge. \"I'm a Kjöge hen,\" she said. And then she told him all about her town, and how many people there were in it, and about a battle that had taken place there once, though that wasn't really worth mentioning.\n\n\"Krible, kragle, bang!\" Something dropped down. And a wooden bird appeared; it was the parrot from the shooting match at Praestö. The bird told the little boy very proudly that there were just as many inhabitants in its town as there were nails in its body. \"Thorvaldsen used to live around the corner from me! Bang! Here I lie comfortably!\"\n\nBut little Tuck was no longer lying in bed-all of a sudden he was on horseback! Gallopy, gallopy, it went! He was sitting in front of a splendidly dressed knight, with shining helmet and nodding plume. On through the woods they galloped to the old town of Vordingborg, and that was a big and lively town. High towers rose above the royal castle, and radiant lights streamed from its windows; inside there was singing and dancing, and King Valdemar led the lovely court ladies in the dance. But soon morning came, and as the sun rose the town seemed to melt away, and the King's castle sank down, one tower after another, until at last only one tower was left standing on the hill where the castle had been, and the town had become very small and very poor. The schoolboys came along with their books under their arms, and said, \"Two thousand inhabitants,\" but that wasn't true. There were not so many as that.\n\nAnd still little Tuck lay in his bed, as if he were dreaming and not dreaming at the same time, but there seemed to be someone standing close beside him.\n\n\"Little Tuck, Little Tuck!\" someone said. It was a sailor, a very little fellow, small enough to have been a midshipman, although he wasn't a midshipman. \"I bring you many greetings from Korsör, that's a growing town, a lively flourishing town with steamboats and mail coaches. In olden times people used to call it ugly, but that's not true any more.\n\n\" 'I lie by the seashore,' Korsör says to you. 'I have highroads and beautiful parks, and I once gave birth to a poet who was very witty. That's more than can be said for all of them. I wanted to send a ship around the world, but I didn't. But I could have done it. Anyway, I smell deliciously, because close by my gates, the most beautiful roses bloom!' \"\n\nLittle Tuck saw them, and everything was green and red before his eyes, but when the confusion of colors was over, they changed to wooden heights, sloping down to the sparkling waters of a fiord. A stately old twin-spired church towered above the waters. From out of the cliffside springs of water rushed down in bubbling streams, and near by sat an old king with a golden crown on his long hair. It was King Hroar of the Springs, and the place is now the town of Roskilde (Hroar's Springs). Up the hill and into the old church the kings and queens of Denmark walked hand in hand, all with their golden crowns, and the organ was playing, and the springs rippled.\n\n\"Don't forget the towns of the kingdom!\" said King Hroar.\n\nThen all at once everything vanished-and where had it all gone? It was like turning a leaf in a book.\n\nNow an old peasant woman stood before Little Tuck; she was a weeding woman from Sorö, where grass grows in the market place. She had thrown her gray linen apron over her head and down her back, and it was soaking wet-it must have been raining.\n\n\"Yes, it certainly has been,\" she said. She knew many of the comic parts from Holberg's comedies, and all about Valdemar and Absolon.\n\nBut all at once she squatted down and wagged her head, just as if she were about to leap. \"Ko-ax,\" she said. \"It's wet! It's wet! It's quiet as a grave in Sorö!\" Suddenly she was a frog, \"Ko-ax!\" and then she became an old woman again. \"You should always dress according to the weather!\" she explained. \"It's wet! Very wet! My town is just like a bottle-you go in with the cork, and you have to come out the same way. In the old days I used to have beautiful fish there, and now I have red-cheeked little boys down in the bottom of the bottle. They learn a lot of wisdom there - Greek! Greek! Hebrew! Hebrew! Ko-ax!\" It sounded like the croaking of frogs, or the creaking of big boots as you walk across the moor; always the same sound-so monotonous-so tiresome-yes, so tiresome that Little Tuck fell into a deep sleep, which was the best thing in the world for him.\n\nBut even in this sleep he had a dream or something like that. It seemed that his little sister, Gustava, with her blue eyes and golden curly hair, had suddenly become a grown-up beautiful lady, and she could fly without wings. Together they flew over the green forests and the deep blue waters of Seeland.\n\n\"Do you hear the cock crowing, Little Tuck? Cock-a-doodle-do! The hens are flying up out of Kjöge. You'll have a big, big chicken yard; you'll never suffer want or hunger; yes, you shall shoot the parrot, as the saying goes; you shall be a rich and happy man. Your manor shall rise up like King Valdemar's towers, and it shall be richly adorned with marble statues, like those in Praestö! Can you understand me? The fame of your name shall travel around the world, like this ship that was to sail from Korsör!\" And from Roskilde town came the voice of King Hroar, \"Remember the towns of the kingdom!\"\n\n\"There you shall speak wisely and well, Little Tuck. And when you are in your grave you shall sleep as peacefully as-\"\n\n\"As if I were in Sorö!\" cried Little Tuck, and then he woke up.\n\nIt was broad daylight, and he couldn't remember the smallest part of his dream. And he wasn't supposed to either, for we shouldn't know things that are going to happen in the future.\n\nNow he sprang quickly out of bed and read his geography book, and at once he knew the whole lesson!\n\nAnd the old washerwoman put her head in the door and nodded good morning to him.\n\n\"Many thinks (NB! = thanks) for your help yesterday, dear child,\" she said. \"May the Lord make all your dreams come true!\"\n\nLittle Tuck didn't know anything that he had dreamed, but you see-our Lord knew it!"

      "body": "Difference always beautiful:\n\nShirin was still a relatively young girl when her parents sent her away from her home in Tehran to live in a big city in England called London. Shirin did not like the idea of going to live with her cousins in England, but her mother told her, ‘It is best, little one. It is no longer safe here and you will have an exciting new life in England and you will make all kinds of new friends.’ Little Shirin wanted to cry because she loved her mother and father very much and she did not want to leave them. Also, she did not know her cousins at all. \n\nThey had only visited once and Shirin was too little to understand what they were saying because they did not speak Farsi which Shirin thought was very strange indeed. And so the day arrived and Shirin’s mother and father drove her to the airport where she would be escorted onto the plane by her aunty. ‘I’m scared,’ said Shirin as her father and mother walked her to the little booth where the man would look at her passport and check her ticket. ‘How can you be scared?’ asked her father. ‘Aren’t you the brave little girl who was never afraid when the bombs could be heard dropping on the city? And aren’t you the girl who always insisted that we take you to school every day even when the other little girls were too afraid and stayed at home with their parents?’ ‘That’s different,’ said Shirin.\n\n ‘This is my home.’ Shirin’s mother knelt down beside the little girl and hugged her and stroked her hair. She said to her daughter: ‘I know that you will make us proud, little one. And don’t you worry, soon your father and I will come to England and you can show us all of the things to see in London. I bet you will be speaking English even better than you do already and you can teach me some new words.’ Shirin liked the idea of teaching her mother new words because Shirin thought that her mother was the cleverest person in the whole wide world. ‘I suppose I could do that,’ said the little girl as her aunty took her hand and explained that it was time to get on to the aeroplane before it flew off without them. During the long flight to England, little Shirin tried to imagine what her new life would be like. She was determined to do well at school and she told herself that she would make her parents very proud.\n\n ‘I can do this,’ she thought. ‘I can do this as easy as picking flowers.’ Then the little girl fell asleep and dreamed of what London would be like. She dreamed about tall clocks and wide rivers; she pictured old men in bowler hats, ladies with umbrellas, bright red busses, and the big house where the Queen lived with all of her guards in their tall fuzzy hats and long boots. But when she arrived at the airport in London it was not quite as she had imagined at all. The sky was a horrible grey colour and it was windy and raining. Shirin wished that she had not decided to wear her sandals because her toes were very cold. And worst of all... Worst of all was the feeling that everybody was looking at her as if she was an alien with a big head and three eyes. Shirin noticed with surprise that she was the only one wearing a chador.\n\n A girl standing close by pointed and laughed and asked her mummy: ‘why is she wearing a big cloth wrapped around her like that?’ The mother pulled the little girl away and told her that it was rude to point. Shirin wanted to tell the little girl that is was not a big cloth, it was a chador, and in Tehran many of the girls and their mothers and grandmothers wore a chador because it was a part of their culture. \n\nOf course, Shirin wanted to take her chador off because she did not like being stared at in such a way, and she wished that she was back in Tehran where it was sunny and her toes would be warm once more. ‘Let’s get you home,’ said her aunty as she hurried the young girl into a big black taxi with an orange light on its roof. Shirin thought that the taxi driver sounded very funny. Not at all like her English teacher Mr Rahimi. He said things like ‘Blimey’ and ‘awright love, where to?’ Little Shirin did not understand these words, but luckily her aunty seemed to understand and they were soon whizzing through the city towards her new home. \n\nShirin wanted ask her aunty why she did not wear a chador in England even though she always wore one when she visited her mother in Tehran. ‘She must be in disguise,’ thought the young girl. But Shirin also remembered that her mother had always told her it was no use trying to hide your true self from others, so Shirin wondered why her aunty chose to be in disguise when in England. London turned out to be a very strange place indeed. It rained everyday for the first week and Shirin did not think much of British summertime at all. She had trouble understanding what people were saying even though she was told that her English was very good. \n\nAnd it turned out that not just anybody could go and say hello to the Queen in her big house even though there must have been a hundred rooms in which to welcome visitors and have tea. The young girl was very disappointed in her new home and she missed her mother and father and her friends. Even the food was different: it was grey like the weather and seemed to come out of boxes from the freezer, not like her mother’s loobia polo with saffron, or crispy tah-deeg which was colourful and delicious to eat. \n\nWhen the day arrived for Shirin to go to her new school, she was very nervous and tried to convince her aunty that she was too sick to get out of bed. ‘I don’t want to go,’ she protested. ‘I don’t know anybody and people keep staring at me!’ ‘There are lots of girls at school who wear a chador just like you, little one,’ said her aunty. ‘I am sure you will make lots of friends today, you just wait and see.’ But it did not go that way at all, not a first. There were indeed other girls who wore a chador, but they were all older than Shirin and they refused to speak to her. The girls in her own class pointed and laughed. They all had light brown hair or blonde hair and blue eyes, and they did not want to make friends with the new girl because she was different from them and had dark skin and dark eyes and wore a chador.\n\n It did not feel good to be so different from others and Shirin wished once more that she was back home with her mother. It was during lunch break, as she was sitting in the corner of the playground planning her big escape back to Tehran, that a young boy approached little Shirin. ‘My name is Stephen,’ said the boy. ‘Would you like to share some of my milkshake with me?’ And with that the young boy offered Shirin his strawberry milkshake with a straw in the top. Shirin thought that the milkshake tasted amazing and had to stop herself from drinking it all up. \n\n‘Don’t pay any attention to the others. They are mean to me too sometimes because I live with my mum. My Dad left us a long time ago and now it is just the two of us. My mum is brilliant and looks after me really well, but we don’t have much money and they always laugh at me because they say I am poor and have dirty clothes.’ Stephen looked down at his blazer and shoes and shrugged. ‘They’re not dirty, they’re just old.’ The young boy suddenly broke into a big smile. ‘They are silly anyway. What do they know!’ Shirin laughed because Steven had a lovely smile and he also had a big strawberry moustache from pulling out the straw of his milkshake and drinking straight from the bottle, all down in one with a glug, glugging sound. The young girl had to admit that she had never let other peoples’ opinions bother her before, so why should she start now? ‘You’re right,’ she said, ‘what do they know anyway!’ And in exchange for giving her some of his milkshake, Shirin pulled four pieces of baklava from her pocket and shared the sweet pastries with her new friend.\n\n ‘I think your headscarf looks cool,’ said Stephen as he wolfed down a whole piece of baklava in one go.’ ‘It called a chador,’ Shirin told him. The young boy rolled the words around in his mouth along with the sugary baklava. ‘Well it looks really cool,’ he said. A chador jumperSuddenly Stephen pulled his blazer up over his head so that he too was wearing a kind of chador. Shirin had to laugh again as the boy looked very funny indeed. She imagined that her mother and father would like Stephen very much because he was a strong person and always looked on the bright side of life which Shirin’s mother said was very important for people to do. Soon the two were lost in games of make-believe and adventure, running about in the corner of the playground, chasing each other all over the place. They exchanged stories and Shirin told Stephen all about life in Tehran, and Stephen told Shirin about all of the cool things you could do in London, like play in the big park or go to the zoo or the cinema. There was even a huge wheel that you could ride in. ‘They built it right on the edge of the River Thames. It’s massive!’ he exclaimed as he made a big circle in the air with his arms. \n\nWell it was not too long before the other children noticed how much fun Shirin and Stephen were having, and very soon they began to gather round and join in with the games and the stories. Before the bell rang to call the children back to class, there was a big group of children all gathered around listening to Shirin tell stories about life in Tehran and how she had hidden under her bed when she heard the bombs dropping from the sky at night, or how she would visit her crazy uncle who lived in a big house on the beach which she went to for holidays. The children were amazed to hear such stories and could not help asking lots of questions which Shirin was happy to answer. In turn, Shirin asked about England and why it was so cold even though it was summertime, and why the Queen didn’t like visitors. \n\nThis made the children laugh. In the end, a teacher had to come out into the playground and call the children back to class because they had not even noticed the bell ringing because they were having so much fun. On her way across the playground, Shirin felt a great rush of gratitude towards Stephen because he had shown her something very important. ‘It is okay to be different,’ she told herself. In fact, it is really quite beautiful.’ And with this thought held firmly in her mind, little Shirin was determined to make a new life for herself in England and make her parents very proud. ‘Who knows,’ she thought, ‘perhaps when my mother and father get here they will know how I can get to meet the Queen.’"

      "body": "The Story Of Hanukkah:\n\nLong ago in the land of Israel, in the center of the walled city of Jerusalem, there stood a beautiful temple. Outside of Israel, there lived a very wicked man named Antiochus, the King of Syria. The King did not like people who had beliefs different than his own. So, he went around the world forcing his religion on all the people he conquered.\n\nWhen Antiochus and his army invaded Israel and took it over, he decreed that only his Gods could be worshiped. He made the Jews swear that they would give up their religion and customs and follow his instead. He also commanded that all of the Jewish temples be converted or destroyed, including the beautiful one in Jerusalem.\n\nThose who refused to follow Antiochus’ commands were to be severely punished. Some Jews obeyed and Antiochus out of fear but others were brave enough to refuse. Judah Maccabee was one such man. Judah and his brothers were all strong fighters and formed an army of their own to fight King Antiochus and his men.\nAlthough they were greatly outnumbered, the Maccabees fought the Syrian army with all their might. With the strength that only comes from fighting for something you truly believe in, Judah and the Maccabees defeated Antiochus and his army and triumphantly reclaimed the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nHowever, when they entered the Temple for the first time, they were shocked to see it in shambles. The golden pitchers were all tarnished, the marble floors were cracked, and there was no pure olive oil to light the Menorah. They began cleaning the temple, removing every sign and symbol of the religion that had been forced upon them by their invaders.\n\nThey all knew the little oil they had would only be enough for one night. But then, a miracle took place. Instead of going out, the lamps kept burning and burning. They burned for eight days and eight nights. And this way, the Maccabees knew God was with them.\n\nThat is why Hanukkah is celebrated every year from 12th December to 20th December. Eight candles are lit in the Menorahs to signify the miracle of the small oil pitcher that burned for eight days and eight nights."

He used to mock and make fun of other people and always acted like he was the smartest man on the Earth.\n\nOne day, this man went to the market to buy a donkey. At the market, he chose the best donkey and bought it right then and there. He loved that donkey so much that he did not ride on its back when he went home. Instead, he walked and pulled the donkey behind him.\n\nAlong the road behind some bushes, two cunning thieves were watching him when suddenly they decided to steal the donkey. “You cannot believe how stupid some people are. Just do as I say!” one thief said to the other as they approached quietly from behind.\n\nThe two thieves snuck up behind the man and carefully slipped the rope off from around the donkey’s neck. As one thief led the donkey away, the other thief put the rope around his own neck and continued to walk along behind the man.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, the donkey owner looked over his shoulder and realized he was pulling a man instead of a donkey. He was surprised and asked, “Where is my donkey?” To which the thief replied, “I’m sorry, Sir! I was your donkey!” “I don’t believe you. How can a donkey change itself into a  man?” asked the man.\n\n“Well, Sir, some years ago, I hurt my mother and then I was cursed to be a donkey. I was taken to the marketplace and sold there by my uncle. Now I’ve become a man again because the person that bought me is a wise and an intelligent man,” the thief said. Hearing this, the man puffed up his chest feeling very proud and said to the thief, “Now, you go home and remember never hurt your mother again!” The thief thanked him and walked away.\n\nLater, the two thieves brought the donkey to the very same place where he had been bought and sold him.

At the end of the story, they all had a good laugh and word of what happened quickly spread throughout the village.\n\nThe next day, the man came to the market to buy another donkey. He started to look at all the donkeys for sale when he saw that his lost donkey was being sold among the other donkeys. The man realized he had been tricked. But to preserve his appearance in front of the seller, he decided to speak to the donkey.\n\n“Well, young man,” he said, “I gave you a chance but you didn’t listen to my advice and now, you have become a donkey again. This time, I won’t buy you!” With that, the man left the marketplace looking rather proud of himself while everyone who knew the story laughed until they cried.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: THE SMARTER YOU THINK YOURSELF, THE MORE IGNORANT YOU REALLY ARE!"

      "body": "You Are Standing On An Acre Of Diamonds:\n\nOne of the most interesting Americans who lived in the 19th century was a man by the name of Russell Herman Conwell. He was born in 1843 and lived until 1925. He was a lawyer for about fifteen years until he became a clergyman.\n\nOne day, a young man went to him and told him he wanted a college education but couldn’t swing it financially. Dr. Conwell decided, at that moment, what his aim in life was, besides being a man of cloth- that is. He decided to build a university for unfortunate, but deserving, students. He did have a challenge, however. He would need a few million dollars to build the\nuniversity. For Dr. Conwell, and anyone with real purpose in life, nothing could stand in the way of his goal.\n\nSeveral years before this incident, Dr. Conwell was tremendously intrigued by a true story- with its ageless moral. The story was about a farmer who lived in Africa and through a visitor became tremendously excited about looking for diamonds. Diamonds were already discovered in abundance on the African continent and this farmer got so excited about the idea of millions of dollars worth of diamonds that he sold his farm to head out to the diamond line. He wandered all over the continent, as the years slipped by, constantly searching for diamonds, wealth, which he never found. Eventually he went completely broke and threw himself into a river and drowned.\n\nMeanwhile, the new owner of his farm picked up an unusual looking rock about the size of a country egg and put it on his mantle as a sort of curiosity. A visitor stopped by and in viewing the rock practically went into terminal convulsions. He told the new owner of the farm that the funny looking rock on his mantle was about the biggest diamond that had ever been found. The new owner of the farm said, ” Heck! The whole farm is covered with them\" – and sure enough it was.”\n\nThe farm turned out to be the Kimberly Diamond Mine... the richest the world has ever known. The original farmer was literally standing on \"Acres of Diamonds\" until he sold his farm.\n\nDr. Conwell learned from the story of the farmer and continued to teach it’s moral. Each of us is right in the middle of our own \"Acre of Diamonds\", if only we would realize it and develop the ground we are standing on before charging off in search of greener pastures. Dr. Conwell told this story many times and attracted enormous audiences. He told the story long enough to have raised the money to start the college for underprivileged deserving students. In fact, he raised nearly six million dollars and the university he founded, Temple University in Philadelphia, has at least ten degree-granting colleges and six other schools.\n\nWhen Doctor Russell H. Conwell talked about each of us being right on our own \"Acre of Diamonds\", he meant it. This story does not get old...it will be true forever...\n\nOpportunity does not just come along – it is there all the time – we just have to see it."

The dead man had been carried to it, and this morning he was to be buried. There was no one to stand by the coffin and look down in sorrow at the dead, no one to shed a tear over him.\n\nA white cloth covered his face, and under his head lay a great thick book, its leaves formed of whole sheets of gray paper. And between each leaf there lay withered flowers, kept close and hidden, so that the book was really a complete herbarium, gathered in many different places. His request had been that the book be buried with him, for each flower had formed a chapter of his life.\n\n\"Who is the dead man?\" we asked; and the answer was:\n\n\"The old student of Upsala. They say he was once a brilliant man who knew foreign languages and could sing and write songs, too. But it was also said that something went wrong with him, and he wasted his thoughts and himself in drinking. Finally, when his health was gone he came out here to the country, where some kindly person paid his board and lodging. He was as gentle as a child, but when his dark moods came on him he became as strong as a giant and ran about the forest like a hunted beast. But if we could manage to get him home and persuade him to open the book with the withered flowers, he would sit quietly all day long, looking at one flower after another, and often the tears rolled down his cheeks. God only knows what thoughts those flowers brought back to him. But he begged that the book be laid in the coffin with him, so there it is. In a little while we'll nail the lid down, and then he will have his sweet rest in the grave.\"\n\nWe lifted up the cloth; there was a peaceful look on the face of the dead man; a ray of sunshine flickered across it. A swallow darted swiftly into the arbor and wheeled rapidly, twittering above the dead man's head.\n\nSurely we all know that strange feeling when we take out old letters of our youth and read them. All the hopes and sorrows of our life seem to rise up before us again. How many of those whom we then knew and were on intimate terms with are dead to us now! Yet they are still alive, although for a long time they have not been in our thoughts - those whom we once thought we should cling to forever, and share their joys and sorrows.\n\nThe faded oak leaf in that silent book is the memento of a friend, the school friend who was to remain a friend for life. He himself had fastened that leaf in the student's cap in the green forest long ago, when that lifelong bond of friendship was made. Where is that friend now? The leaf is kept; the bond-broken.\n\nHere is a foreign hothouse plant, far too tender for the gardens of the North; its fresh odor seems to cling to it still. The daughter of a noble house gave it to him out of her own garden.\n\nHere is a water lily that he himself plucked, and watered with his bitter tears, a water lily of sweet waters. And what do the leaves of this nettle tell us? What were his thoughts when he plucked it and laid it away?\n\nHere are lilies of the valley from the dark solitudes of the forest, honeysuckle from the taproom flowerpot, and here the sharp, bare grass blade.\n\nGently the blooming lilac bends its fresh and fragrant clusters over the dead man's head; the swallow darts by again - \"Quivit! Quivit!\" Now the men come with nails and hammer; the lid is laid over the dead, who rests his head silently on the silent book.\n\nHidden - forgotten!"

      "body": "The Drawing That Talked:\n\nPinty Tailor was a little boy who enjoyed going to school and doing all sorts of things, except\nfor art and writing. Using brushes and pencils did not come easy to Pinty, so his works of art\ndid not end happily, and he would just give up in disgust.\n\nBut one day Pinty found a pencil of such lovely colours that he could not resist, and he tried\ndrawing a circle. As ever, it did not go well, and he was about to throw the pencil away\nwhen his drawing began to speak to him.\n\n‘Psst! You aren’t going to leave me like this, are you? Come on, the least you can do is draw\nme a pair of eyes!’ said the drawing. Pinty was understandably shocked, but he managed to\ndraw two little spots inside the circle.\n\n‘Much better, now I can see myself,’ said the circle, looking around at itself… ‘Arghh! But\nwhat have you done to me?!’\n‘I don’t draw very well,’ said Pinty, trying to make excuses.\n\n‘OK, no problem,’ the drawing interrupted him, ‘I’m sure that if you try again you’ll do\nbetter. Go on, rub me out!’ So Pinty erased the circle and drew another one. Like the first\none, it was not very round.\n\n‘Hey! You forgot the eyes again!’\n‘Oh, yeah.’\n‘Hmmm, I think I’m going to have to teach you how to draw until you can do me well,’ said\nthe circle with its quick, squeaky little voice.\n\nTo Pinty, who remained almost paralysed with shock, this did not seem like a bad idea, and\nhe immediately found himself drawing and erasing circles. The circle would not stop saying\n‘rub this out, but carefully; it hurts,’ or ‘draw me some hair, quickly, I look like a lollipop!’\nand other funny remarks.\n\nAfter spending nearly the whole afternoon together, Pinty could already draw the little\nfigure much better than most of his classmates could have. He was enjoying it so much that\nhe did not want to stop drawing with this crazy new teacher of his. Before going to bed that\nnight, Pinty gave his new instructor a hearty thank you for having taught him how to draw\nso well.\n‘But I didn’t do anything, silly!’ answered the little drawing, in its usual quick manner.\n‘Don’t you see that you’ve been practicing a lot, and enjoying it all the while? I bet that’s the\nfirst time you’ve done that!’\n\nPinty stopped to think. The truth was that previously, he had drawn so badly because he\nhad never practiced more than ten minutes at a time, and he had always done it angrily and\ngrudgingly. Without doubt, what the little drawing had said was correct.\n‘OK, you’re right, but thank you anyway,’ said Pinty, and before he went to bed he carefully\nplaced the pencil in his school bag.\n\nThe next morning Pinty jumped out of bed and went running to find his pencil, but it was\nnot there. He searched everywhere, but there was no sign of it. And the sheet of paper on\nwhich he had drawn the little figure, although still full of rubbing out marks, was completely\nblank. Pinty began to worry, and he did not know if he had really spent the previous\nafternoon talking with the little man or whether he had dreamt the whole thing.\nSo, to try to settle the matter, he took a pencil and some paper and tried to draw a little\nman.\n\nIt turned out not bad at all, except for a couple of jagged lines. He imagined his bossy little\nteacher telling him to round out those edges, and that it looked like he was trying to give\nhim spots. Pinty gladly rubbed out those bits and redrew them. He realised that the crazy\nlittle teacher had been right: it made no difference whether you had the magic pencil or not;\nto manage to do things, you only needed to keep trying and to enjoy doing so.\nFrom that day on, whenever Pinty tried to draw or paint, or do anything else, he always had\nfun imagining the result of his work protesting to him and saying ‘Come on, my friend, do\nme a bit better than that! I can’t go to the party looking like this!’"

As he looked around, he didn’t see anyone guarding the fruits on the tree. At once, he decided to steal some fruits. As soon as he walked into the farm and started to climb the tree, a farmer saw him and chased the lazy man. The lazy man saw the farmer coming behind him with a stick. He got so afraid and ran as fast as he could. He ran for his life and reached in the forest nearby and went inside it to hide.\n\nAfter some time, he started to move on from the forest. While crossing the forest, he saw a wonderful scene. There was a fox that had only two legs. The fox was still crawling happily. The lazy man thought, “How can this fox stay alive in such a poor condition? The poor fox cannot even walk properly! How it must be able to feed himself or stay alive from the threat of other animals!”\n\nSuddenly, he saw the lion coming towards the fox with a piece of meat in his mouth. All the animals ran away as they saw a lion coming towards them. The lazy man climbed up the tree to save himself but, the fox stayed at its place. It was not able to run with its two legs. But what the lazy man saw was truly surprising! The lion left a piece of meat that was in his mouth for the fox.\n\nThe lazy man felt happy seeing god’s play. He thought the god who is the creator of all, always has a plan to take care of its people. He thought that God must have planned something for him, too. So, he left that place and sat under a tree waiting for someone to feed him, too.\n\nHe spent hours waiting for his food. He waited there for two days without any food! Finally, when he couldn’t bear hunger anymore, he left the place and decided to go back home.\n\nOn his way, he met an old sage. The old sage was known for his wisdom. The lazy man told everything he saw throughout his journey. The sage first gave him some food and water. After that, he asked the sage, “Oh, wise sage, the god had shown his kindness on the handicapped fox, but why the god was so cruel to me?”\n\nThe old sage smiled and said, “That’s true! God has a plan for everyone. You are definitely a part of god’s plan. However, my child, you took his sign in the wrong way. The god did not want you to be like the fox. He wanted you to be like the Lion”.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: ALWAYS LEARN TO SEE THINGS IN A POSITIVE WAY AND SEE YOURSELF IN A STRONG POSITION TO HELP OTHERS.\n“OR”\nDON’T GO FOR AN EASY CHOICE.

      "body": "Little Ida's Flowers:\n\n\"My poor flowers are quite dead,\" said little Ida. \"They were so pretty last evening, but now every leaf has withered and drooped. Why do they do that?\" she asked the student who sat on the sofa.\n\nShe was very fond of him because he told such good stories and could cut such amusing figures out of paper-hearts with dancing ladies inside them, flowers of all sorts, and castles with doors that you could open and close. He was a rollicking fellow.\n\n\"Why do my flowers look so ill today?\" she asked him again, and showed him her withered bouquet.\n\n\"Don't you know what's the matter with them?\" the student said. \"They were at the ball last night, that's why they can scarcely hold up their heads.\"\n\n\"Flowers can't dance,\" said little Ida.\n\n\"Oh, indeed they can,\" said the student. \"As soon as it gets dark and we go to sleep, they frolic about in a fine fashion. Almost every night they give a ball.\"\n\n\"Can't children go to the ball?\"\n\n\"Little daisies can go. So can lilies of the valley.\"\n\n\"Where do the prettiest flowers dance?\" Ida asked.\n\n\"Haven't you often visited the beautiful flower garden just outside of town, around the castle where the King lives in the summertime? You remember-the place where swans swim close when you offer them bread crumbs. Believe me! that's where the prettiest flowers dance.\"\n\n\"Yesterday I was there with my mother,\" said Ida, \"but there wasn't a leaf on the trees, or a flower left. Where are they? Last summer I saw ever so many.\"\n\n\"They are inside the castle, of course,\" said the student. \"Confidentially, just as soon as the King comes back to town with all of his court, the flowers run from the garden into the castle and enjoy themselves. You should see them. The two loveliest roses climb up on the throne, where they are the king and the queen. All the red coxcombs line up on either side, to stand and bow like grooms of the bedchamber. Then all the best dressed flowers come, and the grand ball starts. The blue violets are the naval cadets. Their partners, whom they call 'Miss,' are hyacinths and crocuses. The tulips and tiger lilies are the old chaperones, who see to it that the dancing is done well and that everyone behaves properly.\"\n\n\"But\", said little Ida, \"doesn't anybody punish the flowers for dancing in the King's own castle?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows a thing about it,\" said the student. \"To be sure, there's the old castle keeper, who is there to watch over things. Sometimes he comes in the night with his enormous bunch of keys. But as soon as the flowers hear the keys jangle they keep quiet, and hide, with only their heads peeking out from behind the curtains. Then the old castle keeper says, 'I smell flowers in here.' But he can't see any.\"\n\n\"What fun!\" little Ida clapped her hands. \"But couldn't I see the flowers either?\"\n\n\"Oh easily,\" said the student. \"The very next time you go there, remember to peep in the windows. There you will see them, as I did today. A tall yellow lily lay stretched on the sofa, pretending to be a lady-in-waiting.\"\n\nCan the flowers who live in the botanical gardens visit the castle? Can they go that far?\"\n\n\"Why certainly. They can fly all the way if it suits them. Haven't you seen lovely butterflies-white, yellow, and red ones? They almost look like flowers, and that's really what they used to be. They are flowers, who have jumped up off their stems, high into the air. They beat the air with their petals, as though these were little wings, and so they manage to fly. If they behave themselves nicely, they get permission to fly all day long, instead of having to go home and sit on their stems. In time their petals turn into real wings. You've seen them yourself. However, it's quite possible that the botanical garden flowers have never been to the King's castle and don't know anything about the fun that goes on there almost every night. Therefore I'll tell you how to arrange a surprise for the botanical professor. You know the one I mean-he lives quite near here. Well, the next time you go to the garden, tell one of his flowers that they are having a great ball in the castle. One flower will tell the others, and off they'll fly. When the professor comes out in the garden not one flower will he find, and where they've all gone he will never be able to guess.\"\n\n\"How can a flower tell the others?\" You know flowers can't speak.\"\n\n\"They can't speak,\" the student agreed, \"but they can signal. Haven't you noticed that whenever the breeze blows the flowers nod to one another, and make signs with their leaves. Why, it's as plain as talk.\"\n\n\"Can the professor understand their signs?\"\n\n\"Certainly he can. One morning he came into his garden and saw a big stinging nettle leaf signaling to a glorious red carnation, 'You are so beautiful, and I love you so much.' But the professor didn't like that kind of thing, so he slapped the nettle's leaves, for they are its fingers. He was stung so badly that he hasn't laid hands on a stinging nettle since.\"\n\n\"Oh, how jolly!\" little Ida laughed.\n\n\"How can anyone stuff a child's head with such nonsense?\" said the prosy councilor, who had come to call and sit on the sofa too. He didn't like the student a bit. He always grumbled when he saw the student cut out those strange, amusing pictures-sometimes a man hanging from the gallows and holding a heart in his hand to show that he had stolen people's hearts away; sometimes an old witch riding a broomstick and balancing her husband on her nose. The councilor highly disapproved of those, and he would say as he said now, \" How can anyone stuff a child's head with such nonsense-such stupid fantasy?\"\n\nBut to little Ida, what the student told her about flowers was marvelously amusing, and she kept right on thinking about it. Her flowers couldn't hold their heads up, because they were tired out from dancing all night. Why they must be ill. She took them to where she kept her toys on a nice little table, with a whole drawer full of pretty things. Her doll, Sophie, lay asleep in the doll's bed, but little Ida told her:\n\n\"Sophie, you'll really have to get up, and be satisfied to sleep in the drawer tonight, because my poor flowers are ill. Maybe, if I let them sleep in your bed tonight, they will get well again.\"\n\nWhen she took the doll up, Sophie looked as cross as could be, and didn't say a word. She was sulky because she couldn't keep her own bed.\n\nIda put the flowers to bed, and tucked the little covers around them. She told them to be good and lie still, while she made them some tea, so that they would get well and be up and about tomorrow. She carefully drew the curtains around the little bed, so the morning sun would not shine in their faces.\n\nAll evening long she kept thinking of what the student had said, before she climbed into bed herself. She peeped through the window curtains at the fine potted plants that belonged to her mother-hyacinths and tulips, too. She whispered very softly, \"I know you are going to the ball tonight.\"\n\nBut the flowers pretended not to understand her. They didn't move a leaf. But little Ida knew all about them.\n\nAfter she was in bed, she lay there for a long while thinking how pleasant it must be to see the flowers dance in the King's castle. \"Were my flowers really there?\" she wondered. Then she fell asleep. When she woke up again in the night, she had been dreaming of the flowers, and of the student, and of the prosy councilor who had scolded him and had said it was all silly nonsense. It was very still in the bedroom where Ida was. The night lamp glowed on the table, and Ida's mother and father were asleep.\n\n\"Are my flowers still asleep in Sophie's bed?\" Ida wondered. \"That's what I'd like to know.\"\n\nShe lifted herself a little higher on her pillow, and looked towards the door which stood half open. In there were her flowers and all her toys. She listened, and it seemed to her that someone was playing the piano, very softly and more beautifully than she had ever heard it played.\n\n\"I'm perfectly sure that those flowers are all dancing,\" she said to herself. \"Oh, my goodness, wouldn't I love to see them.\" But she did not dare get up, because that might awaken her father and mother.\n\n\"I do wish the flowers would come in here!\" she thought. But they didn't. The music kept playing, and it sounded so lovely that she couldn't stay in bed another minute. She tiptoed to the door, and peeped into the next room. Oh, how funny-what a sight she saw there!\n\nNo night lamp burned in the next room, but it was well lighted just the same. The moonlight streamed through the window, upon the middle of the floor, and it was almost as bright as day. The hyacinths and the tulips lined up in two long rows across the floor. Not one was left by the window. The flowerpots stood there empty, while the flowers danced gracefully around the room, making a complete chain and holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung around.\n\nAt the piano sat a tall yellow lily. Little Ida remembered it from last summer, because the student had sad, \"Doesn't that lily look just like Miss Line?\" Everyone had laughed at the time, but now little Ida noticed that there was a most striking resemblance. When the lily played it had the very same mannerisms as the young lady, sometimes bending its long, yellow face to one side, sometimes to the other, and nodding in time with the lovely music.\n\nNo one suspected that little Ida was there. She saw a nimble blue crocus jump up on the table where her toys were, go straight to the doll's bed, and throw back the curtains. The sick flowers lay there, but they got up at once, and nodded down to the others that they also wanted to dance. The old chimney-sweep doll, whose lower lip was broken, rose and made a bow to the pretty flowers. They looked quite themselves again as they jumped down to join the others and have a good time.\n\nIt seemed as if something clattered off the table. Little Ida looked, and saw that the birch wand, that had been left over from Mardigras time, was jumping down as if he thought he were a flower too. The wand did cut quite a flowery figure, with his paper rosettes and, to top him off, a little wax figure who had a broad trimmed hat just like the one that the councilor wore.\n\nThe wand skipped about on his three red wooden legs, and stamped them as hard as he could, for he was dancing the mazurka. The flowers could not dance it, because they were too light to stamp as he did.\n\nAll of a sudden, the wax figure grew tall and important. He whirled around to the paper flowers beside him, and said, \"How can anyone stuff a child's head with such nonsense-such stupid fantasy?\" At that moment he was a perfect image of the big-hatted councilor, just as sallow and quite as cross. But the paper flowers hit back. They struck his thin shanks until he crumpled up into a very small wax manikin. The change was so ridiculous that little Ida could not keep from laughing.\n\nWherever the sceptered wand danced the councilor had to dance too, whether he made himself tall and important or remained a little wax figure in a big black hat. The real flowers put in a kind word for him, especially those who had lain ill in the doll's bed, and the birch wand let him rest.\n\nJust then they heard a loud knocking in the drawer where Ida's doll, Sophie, lay with the other toys. The chimney-sweep rushed to the edge of the table, lay flat on his stomach and managed to pull the drawer out a little way. Sophie sat up and looked around her, most surprised.\n\n\"Why, they are having a ball!\" she said \"Why hasn't somebody told me about it?\"\n\n\"Won't you dance with me?\" the chimney-sweep asked her.\n\n\"A fine partner you'd be!\" she said, and turned her back on him.\n\nShe sat on the edge of the drawer, hoping one of the flowers would ask her to dance, but not one of them did, She coughed, \"Hm, hm, hm!\" and still not one of them asked her. To make matters worse, the chimney-sweep had gone off dancing by himself, which he did pretty well.\n\nAs none of the flowers paid the least attention to Sophie, she let herself tumble from the drawer to the floor with a bang. Now the flowers all came running to ask, \"Did you hurt yourself?\" They were very polite to her, especially those who had slept in her bed. But she wasn't hurt a bit. Ida's flowers thanked her for the use of her nice bed, and treated her well. They took her out in the middle of the floor, where the moon shone, and danced with her while all the other flowers made a circle around them. Sophie wasn't at all cross now. She said they might keep her bed. She didn't in the least mind sleeping in the drawer.\n\nBut the flowers said, \"Thank you, no. We can't live long enough to keep your bed. Tomorrow we shall be dead. Tell little Ida to bury us in the garden, next to her canary bird's grave. Then we shall come up again next summer, more beautiful than ever.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't die,\" Sophie said, and kissed all the flowers.\n\nThen the drawing room door opened, and many more splendid flowers tripped in. Ida couldn't imagine where they had come from, unless - why, they must have come straight from the King's castle. First came two magnificent roses, wearing little gold crowns. These were the king and the queen. Then. Then came charming gillyflowers and carnations, who greeted everybody. They brought the musicians along. Large poppies and peonies blew upon pea pods until they were red in the face. Blue hyacinths and little snowdrops tinkled their bells. It was such funny music. Many other flowers followed them, and they all danced together, blue violets with pink primroses, and daisies with the lilies of the valley.\n\nAll the flowers kissed one another, and that was very pretty to look at. When the time came to say good night, little Ida sneaked back to bed too, where she dreamed of all she had seen.\n\nAs soon as it was morning, she hurried to her little table to see if her flowers were still there. She threw back the curtain around the bed. Yes, they were there, but they were even more faded than yesterday. Sophie was lying in the drawer where Ida had put her. She looked quite sleepy.\n\n\"Do you remember what you were to tell me?\" little Ida asked.\n\nBut Sophie just looked stupid, and didn't say one word.\n\n\"You are no good at all,\" Ida told her. \"And to think how nice they were to you, and how all of them danced with you.\"\n\nShe opened a little pasteboard box, nicely decorated with pictures of birds, and laid the dead flowers in it.\n\n\"This will be your pretty coffin,\" she told them. \"When my cousins from Norway come to visit us, they will help me bury you in the garden, so that you may come up again next summer and be more beautiful than ever.\"\n\nHer Norwegian cousins were two pleasant boys named Jonas and Adolph. Their father had given them two new crossbows, which they brought with them for Ida to see. She told them how her poor flowers had died, and they got permission to hold a funeral. The boys marched first, with their crossbows on their shoulders. Little Ida followed, with her dead flowers in their nice box. In the garden they dug a little grave. Ida first kissed the flowers, and then she closed the box and laid it in the earth. Adolph and Jonas shot their crossbows over the grave, for they had no guns or cannons."

Because of this, Bruce had suffered a huge loss.\n\nBut still, he thought about the faith of the poor farmers in the village. He decided to help all of them. He used up all of his money to feed them. \n\nAfter a few days, Bruce realized that he had no money left. Soon, he decided to leave the village to seek his fortune.\n\nHe walked and walked and finally reached a temple. The temple was very crowded. The people were standing in a queue. At the front of the queue, there was a shiny pedestal. “What is happening?” asked Bruce to a person standing next to him.\n\n“You see,” said that person pointing to the crown, “that’s a magic crown. It will glow brightly when a very kind man and a selfless person touches it. He will be the rightful owner of that crown. Go ahead! Try touching it.” “I am not interested,” said Bruce. “But why? Why don’t you touch it, Sir?” People around him persuaded him to touch it reluctantly. \n\nFinally, Bruce agreed and stepped ahead to touch the magic crown. To everyone’s surprise and amazement, the crown shone brightly the moment he laid his hand on it.\n\nSeeing this, the priest of the temple walked up to Bruce and embraced him. “You must be a very kind man. That’s why the crown has chosen you. Here, take it,” said the priest. Bruce was overjoyed. He thanked the priest and took the crown back to his village.\n\nThe crown proved to be a lucky charm. As he entered his village, the rain showered. He soon regained all his lost wealth. All the people of that village including Bruce lived happily ever after.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: KINDNESS IS A NOBLE VIRTUE. ALWAYS BE KIND TO OTHERS."

      "body": "Two Words:\n\nOnce upon a time, far away, there used to be a monastery.\n\nNow, this monastery was quite strict. In the monastery, there was a rule for not speaking a word. All the monks in the monastery adhered to this rule. Everyone had taken up the strict vow of silence. And no one in the monastery talked. Not a single word came out their mouths. \n\nBut, there was another rule in the same monastery. Every ten years, all the monks were given a chance to speak. Though the rule specified that every monk was allowed only two words. In the monastery, there was a young monk. Now, he wasn’t comfortable in the monastery.\nSo, when his first ten years were finished, he was allowed to speak. He went to the head monk and sat across him. “Say what you wish,” said the head monk. “Your ten years of silence is complete.” After much thinking, the young monk finally spoke. “Bed, hard,” he said and left.\n\nAfter another ten years, the same monk visited the head monk. “So, what do you have to say this time?” asked the head monk. “Food stinks,” said the monk. After that, he left. Another ten years passed. Again the monk came to visit the head monk.\n\n“What are your two words this time?” asked the head monk. “I quit!” exclaimed the young monk. The head monk thought this was over. Then he finally said, “Well I can see why!” For the master understood, that a man who had nothing but complaints could never accomplish anything!\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: IF YOU ONLY COMPLAIN, YOU’LL NEVER SEE THE FINISH LINE. YOU’LL QUIT BEFORE YOU GET THERE."

She took me from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world; a world of smiles, love and warmth.\n\nThat was ten years ago.

      "body": "Chicken Grethe's Family:\n\nChicken Grethe was the only human tenant of the fine new house that was built for the hens and ducks on the estate. It was built where the old baronial castle had stood with its tower, crow's-perch gable, moat, and drawbridge. Close by was a complete wilderness of trees and bushes. This had been the garden, running down to a big lake which was now a marsh. Rooks, crows, and jackdaws - a whole horde of screeching, cawing birds, hovered over the trees. The flock did not seem to diminish but rather to increase when one fired among them. They could be heard even inside the poultry house where Chicken Grethe sat with the ducklings waddling about her wooden shoes. She knew each chicken and every duck from the moment it hatched. She took pride in her chickens and her ducks, and in the fine house that had been built for them.\n\nHer little room was clean and tidy. Her mistress, who owned the chicken house, insisted upon neatness, for she frequently brought distinguished visitors to see \"the barracks of her hens and ducks,\" as she called the place.\n\nShe had a rocking chair, and a wardrobe, and even a chest of drawers, on which stood a highly polished brass plate with the name \"Grubbe\" engraved on it. This was the name of the old noble family that had lived there in the days when the castle was standing. The brass plate had been found while they were digging the ground and the parish clerk said that it had no value except as a relic. The clerk knew all about the place and the old days, for he was a scholar and his table drawer was filled with manuscripts. He knew much about the old days, but perhaps the oldest crow knew more and jabbered it out in his own language, but that was crow-talk, which the clerk did not understand, learned though he was.\n\nToward the end of hot summer day, the mist would rise over the marsh until it looked as if there were a lake beyond the old trees where the rooks, crows, and jackdaws lived. This was how it had looked when old Sir Grubbe had lived there, and the castle with its massive red walls was still standing. In those days the dog's chain used to reach clear across the gateway. By way of the tower one came to the stone-flagged passage that led to the living quarters. The windows were narrow and the panes quite small, even in the great hall where they used to dance. But, in the days of the last Grubbes, there had been no dancing for as far back as a man could remember, though an old kettledrum that had been used in the orchestra still remained in the hall. And there was also a curiously carved cupboard in which the rare flower bulbs were stored, for Lady Grubbe took pleasure in planting and in cultivating flowers and trees. Her husband preferred to hunt wild boars and wolves, and his little daughter, Marie, always rode with him. When she was no more than five years old, she sat proudly on horseback and gazed fearlessly about with her great dark eyes. She delighted in cracking her whip among the hounds, though her father would rather have seen her lash out among the peasant boys who came to stare at the gentry.\n\nThe peasant who lived in a clay hut near the castle had a son named Sören, who was of the same age as the well-born little lady. He knew how to climb trees, and he had to bring bird nests down to her. The birds screamed as loud as they could scream, and one of the largest of them struck him so hard right above his eye that blood ran down, and they thought at first that he had lost and eye, but it had not been injured. Marie Grubbe called him \"her Sören,\" a sign of high favor which once served to protect even his father, poor Jon. When he had done something wrong one day, Jon was condemned to ride the wooden horse. This contrivance stood in the yard, with four poles for legs, and for its back a single small rail which Jon had to straddle. Lest he ride it too comfortably, heavy bricks were tied to his feet. He made such agonized faces that little Sören wept and went down on his knees to beg. Marie to have his father released. She instantly commanded that his father should be taken down. When she was not obeyed, Marie stamped her small feet on the flagstones and tugged at her father's coat sleeve until she tore it. She would have her way, and she got it. Sören's father was released.\n\nLady Grubbe came to her, stroked her hair, and looked at her daughter with mild, approving eyes. But Marie did not understand why. She would go with the hounds, not with her mother, who went down through the garden to the lake, where the water lilies bloomed, and where the bulrushes swayed among the reeds. \"How charming,\" Lady Grubbe would say, as she admired this fresh, abundant growth. A then very rare tree, which she herself had planted, grew in her garden. A blood beech it was called, a sort of dark Moor among the other trees, so dark brown were its leaves. It needed plenty of sunlight, for in constant shade its leaves would turn green like those of other trees, and thus lose their distinction. In her tall chestnut trees, in the shrubbery, and even the grass were many bird nests. The birds seemed to understand that they were safe here, where no one dared fire a gun.\n\nBut little Marie came here with Sören who, as we know, could climb, and she sent him to bring her down both the eggs and the downy little birds. The parent birds fluttered about in terror and anguish. Large and small - lapwings from the lawns, rooks, crows, and jackdaws, from the tall trees - they screamed and shrieked just as their progeny shriek today.\n\n\"Children, what are you doing?\" the gentlewoman cried. \"What a wicked thing to do.\"\n\nSören looked ashamed and even the high-born young girl looked a little embarrassed, but then she said in an abrupt and sulky way: \"My father lets me do this.\"\n\n\"Away, away!\" the black birds shrieked, and away they flew, but they came back the next day because they lived there.\n\nBut the quiet gentlewoman did not live there much longer. The Lord called her away, and with Him she was more at home than ever she was in this house. The church bells solemnly tolled as her body was carried to the church, and poor men's eyes grew dim, for she had shown them kindness. And now that she was gone no one looked after her plants, so the garden went to rack and ruin.\n\n\"Sir Grubbe is a hard man,\" people would say, \"but young as she is his daughter can handle him.\" He would laugh and let her have her will. She was twelve years old now, tall and well built. She looked right through people with her great dark eyes, rode her horse like a man, and shot her gun like an experienced hunter.\n\nIt came to pass that great men visited that district. They were as great as great can be - the young King with his half-brother and crony, Lord Ulrick Frederick Gyldenlöve. They came to hunt wild boar, and they planned to stay overnight at Sir Grubbe's castle.\n\nAt the table, when Gyldenlöve sat beside Marie, he took her about the neck and gave her a kiss, just as if they had been related. But she gave him a slap in the face, and told him she could not stand him. This caused great laughter, as if it were a most pleasing sight.\n\nAnd maybe it was, because five years later, when Marie was seventeen, Gyldenlöve sent a messenger with a letter asking for her hand in marriage. That was something!\n\n\"He is the highest and most gallant lord in the land,\" said Sir Grubbe. \"You cannot refuse him.\"\n\n\"I don't like him much,\" Marie Grubbe said, but she did not turn down the highest lord in the land, who sat next to the King.\n\nHer silver, woolens, and linens were sent by ship to Copenhagen. Marie made the trip overland in ten days, but the ship with the dowry met with contrary winds, or no wind at all. It took four months to reach Copenhagen, and when it did get there Lady Gyldenlöve had gone.\n\n\"I'd sooner lie on sacks than in his silken bed,\" she said. \"I'd sooner walk barefoot than ride in a carriage with him.\"\n\nLate on an evening in November, two women came riding into the town of Aarhus. They were Lady Gyldenlöve and her maid. They came from Veile, where they had arrived by ship from Copenhagen. They rode up to Sir Grubbe's town house. He was not at all pleased to see Marie. He gave her harsh words, but he did give her a bedroom. She got her beer broth for breakfast, but no good words to go with it. Her father's bad temper had turned against her, and she was not used to it. Her own temper was by no means mild. As one is spoken to, so one answers, and answer she did. Of her husband she spoke with bitterness and hatred. She declared that she could not live with him; she was too honorable and virtuous for that.\n\nIn this fashion a year went by, most unpleasantly. Bitter words passed between father and daughter. That should not be. Bitter words bear bitter fruit. What would be the outcome?\n\nOne day her father said, \"We cannot live under the same roof. You must move to our old castle. I would rather you bit off your tongue than spoke lies.\"\n\nSo they parted. With her maid, she went to the old estate where she was born and bred, and where her mother, that pious gentlewoman, lay in the churchyard vault.\n\nAn old cowherd lived in the castle, and that was all. Cobwebs, heavy and black with dirt, draped every room. The garden was not taken care of. Wild hops and other climbing vines wove a tangled web between trees and shrubbery. Hemlock and nettles grew tall and rank. The blood beech had been outgrown, and in the deep shade its leaves had turned as green as those of ordinary trees. Its glory was gone.\n\nRooks, crows, and jackdaws flew in enormous flocks above the tall chestnuts. They shrieked and cawed as if they had great news to tell each other. Here she was again, the girl who ordered their eggs and babies to be stolen from their nests. The real thief, the one who had actually stolen them, was now climbing a leafless tree. He clung to the tall ship's mast, and got his share of lashes with a rope's end if he didn't behave himself.\n\nAll this was told in our own time by the parish clerk. He had pieced it together from books and letters, and it lay with many another manuscript hidden away in his table drawer. \"Up and down is the way the world goes,\" said he. \"It's a curious story to hear.\" We want to hear how it went with Marie Grubbe, but we shall not lose track of Chicken Grethe who sat there in her fine hen house, in our own day. Marie Grubbe sat in this place in her day, but not so contentedly as old Chicken Grethe.\n\nWinter went by. Spring and summer passed, and again came the stormy autumn with its cold and wet fog. It was a dull and dreary life there on the old estate. Marie Grubbe would snatch up her gun and go out on the heath to shoot hares or foxes, and whatever birds she could find. More than once on these excursions she encountered a nobleman, Sir Palle Dyre from Nörrebaek with his gun and his dogs. He was a big man, who enjoyed boasting of his strength when he talked with her. He might have been a match for the departed Mr. Brockenhus of Egeskov, at Fyen, whom people still remember as a man of might. Like him, Palle Dyre had fastened a hunting horn to an iron chain over his gateway. When he came home he would catch hold of the chain, lift himself and his horse clear off the ground, and sound the horn.\n\n\"You must come to my castle and see that, Lady Marie,\" he said, \"for we have fine fresh air at Nörrebaek.\" We have no record of when she went to Nörrebaek, but on the candlesticks at Nörrebaek church it is inscribed that they were given by Palle Dyre and Marie Grubbe of Nörrebaek Castle. Body and strength had Palle Dyre. He could drink like a sponge. He was like a cask that could never be filled. He snored enough for a whole pig pen, and he looked red and bloated.\n\n\"A cunning swine and a nagging fool he is,\" said Lady Palle Dyre, the daughter of Grubbe. She soon grew weary of the life there, which did not improve matters. At dinner time one day, the food got cold on the table. Palle Dyre was off fox-hunting, and Lady Dyre could not be found. Palle Dyre came home at midnight. Lady Dyre came home neither by midnight nor by morning. She turned her back upon Nörrebaek, and rode away without a word of farewell. The weather was cloudy and wet. The wind was sharp, and the flock of black birds that croaked over her head were not as homeless as she.\n\nFirst she rode south, almost to Germany. She turned a couple of gold rings with precious stones into ready money. She went east and she went west, with no fixed goal. She was angry with everybody and even with the good Lord himself, so sick was her mind. And soon her body was sick too. She could scarcely drag her feet along. The lapwing flew up from its tuft of grass when she stumbled upon it and fell. The bird screamed, as it always does, \"You thief, you thief!\" Yet she had never stolen her neighbors' goods, except for the birds' eggs and nestlings taken from the clumps of grass and the tall trees when she was a little girl. She thought of that now.\n\nFrom where she lay, she could see the sand dunes along the beach. Fishermen lived there, but she was too ill to crawl so far. The great white sea gulls came screaming over her as the rooks, crows, and jackdaws screamed above the trees at home. The birds flew nearer and nearer, until at last she thought they were black birds. But then everything went black before her eyes.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again she was being carried in the arms of a tall, strapping fellow. She looked straight into his bearded face, and saw that he had a scar over one eye that appeared to divide the eyebrow in two. Sick as she was, he carried her to his ship, where he was abused by the shipmaster for bringing such a burden.\n\nThe ship set sail next day. Marie Grubbe sailed with it - she was not put ashore. Didn't she ever come back? Yes, but when and how?\n\nThe parish clerk could tell about this too. It was not a tale which he had pieced together. He had the whole strange story from a reliable book which we can get and read for ourselves.\n\nThe Danish author, Ludvig Holberg, who has written so many books worth reading and so many gay comedies by which we get to know his time and its people, mentions Marie Grubbe in his letters, which tell how and in what part of the world he found her. This is well worth hearing, but we shall not lose track of Chicken Grethe, who sits so happy and comfortable in her imposing chicken house.\n\nThe ship sailed off with Marie Grubbe. That was where we left off. Year upon year went by.\n\nThe plague was raging in Copenhagen. That was in the year of 1711. The Queen of Denmark went to her German home. The King left his capital, and every one who could made haste to leave. The students, even those who had free board and lodging, scurried out of the city. One of them, the last student left at what they called Borch's College, near the students' headquarters, made ready to go. At two o'clock in the morning he started out, with his knapsack stuffed with more books and manuscripts than clothes. A raw, dank mist hung over the city. Not a soul was to be seen in the street through which he passed. All around him the gates and doors were marked with the crosses which showed that there people lay ill or had died of the plague. Even in broad and winding Meatmonger's street - as the street leading from the round tower to the King's palace was called then - there was not a man to be seen. Suddenly a large hearse came rumbling by. The driver cracked his whip to urge his horses into a gallop, for the wagon was crammed with to urge his horses into a gallop, for the wagon was crammed with corpses. The young student covered his face with his hands, and breathed the fumes of strong spirits which he carried in a brass- boxed sponge.\n\nFrom a grog shop in one of the streets came the sound of songs and forced laughter. Men were drinking the night away in an effort to forget that Death stood at their door, beckoning to them to come with him and join the other dead men in the hearse. The student hurried on to Castle Bridge, where two small boats were moored. One of them was just about to cast off and quit the plague-ridden city.\n\n\"If the Lord spares out lives and the wind serves us, we shall sail to Grönsund, on Falster,\" the captain said, and he asked the name of this student who wanted to go with them.\n\n\"Ludvig Holberg,\" the student said, and at that time it sounded like any other name. Now it resounds as one of Denmark's proudest names, but he was then only a young student, and unknown.\n\nThe boat slipped past the castle, and before daybreak they came to the open sea. A light breeze sprang up and the sails filled. The student sat down with the wind in his face, and fell asleep. And that wasn't exactly an advisable thing to do! On the third morning the boat was already at Falster.\n\n\"Do you know of anyone in this place with whom I can live cheaply?\" Holberg asked the captain.\n\n\"I believe you had best go to the ferry man's wife at Borrehouse,\" he said. \"If you want to be polite, call her Mother Sören Sörensen Möller, but she may turn angry if you show her too much politeness. Her husband is under arrest for some crime or other, and she runs the ferry herself. What fists she has!\"\n\nThe student shouldered his knapsack and went to the ferry house. The door was not locked, so he lifted the latch and entered a brick-floored room in which a large folding bed with a big furred cover was the most noticeable piece of furniture. A white hen, with her chickens around her, was tied to the bedstead. She had upset her drinking dish, and water ran across the floor. No one was there or in the next room, except a little child who lay in a cradle.\n\nThe ferry boat came back with only one person on board - whether man or woman was hard to say. This person was wrapped in a great cloak, with a hood that covered the head.\n\nWhen the boat was docked, it was a woman who entered the room. She had an impressive air as she straightened up and looked at him. Two proud eyes were set under her dark brows. It was Mother Sören, the ferry man's wife, though rooks, crows, and jackdaws could scream out another name by which we would know her better.\n\nGlum she looked, and little enough she cared for talk, but it was settled that the student would stay and board with her for an undetermined time, until things went well again in Copenhagen.\n\nNow and then some honest fellows from the neighboring town dropped in at the ferry house. Among them were Frank, the cutler, and Sivert, the customs collector, who came to drink a mug of ale and to chat with the student. He was a thoughtful young man who knew what's what, as they said. He read Latin and Greek, and was well posted in many fields of knowledge.\n\n\"The less one knows, the lighter his burden,\" said Mother Sören.\n\nOne day when Holberg watched her wash clothes in strong lye, and chop up knotty stumps for firewood, he told her:\n\n\"You work too hard.\"\n\n\"That's my business,\" she said.\n\n\"Have you had to toil and slave this way ever since you were a child?\"\n\n\"Read the answer in my hands,\" she said, and showed him her two hands, small but strong and hard, with broken nails. \"You know how to read. Read them.\"\n\nAt Christmas time there was a heavy snowfall. The cold made itself at home, and the winds blew as bitterly as if they were dashing acid in people's faces. Mother Sören didn't care. She flung on her cloak, drew up the hood, and went about her business. When the house grew dark early in the afternoon, she would throw pine knots on the fire and sit by it to darn her stockings, for she had no one to do it for her. As evening came on she talked with the student more than she usually did. she spoke of her husband:\n\n\"By accident he killed a captain from Dragor, and for this they put him in chains and sentenced him to three years of hard labor on the King's Island. He is only an ordinary sailor, so the law must take its course, you know.\"\n\n\"The law applies to the upper classes too,\" Holberg said.\n\n\"Do you believe that?\" Mother Sören stared into the fire, and then went on. \"Do you know the story of Kay Lykke, who ordered one of his churches torn down? When Mads, the pastor, thundered from the pulpit against this, he had Mads clapped in irons and thrown in prison. Then he appointed himself Judge, found Mads guilty, condemned him, and had his head struck off. That was no accident, yet Kay Lykke was never punished.\"\n\n\"He was within his right, according to the custom of his time,\" Holberg said. \"We have come a long way since then.\"\n\n\"Try to make fools believe you.\" Mother Sören got up and went into the next room where Toesen, her little child, lay in the cradle. When she had tidied and aired the cradle, she made the student's bed. He had the big furred cover, for though he was born in Norway he felt the cold more than she did.\n\nNew Year's Day dawned clear and sunny. It was so cold that the snowdrifts were hard enough for one to walk across them. The bells in the village were ringing for church, as student Holberg wrapped himself in his heavy cloak to set off for town. Rooks flew screeching over Börrehouse, and so did the crows and jackdaws. They made such a racket that you could scarcely hear the bells. Mother Sören stood outside, filling a brass kettle with snow, to melt over the fire for drinking water. She gazed up at the dark swarm of birds and thought her own thoughts.\n\nStudent Holberg went to church and on his way back he passed the house of Sivert, the customs collector. Sivert invited him in to warm himself from a bowl of mulled ale, sweetened with syrup and ginger. They started to talk about Mother Sören, but the customs collector knew little about her. Indeed, there were few who did. \"She is not a native of Falster,\" he said, \"and she has probably seen better days. Her husband is a common sailor, with a violent temper. He killed a captain on Dragör, and, though he used to beat his wife, she always sticks up for him.\"\n\n\"I would never stand for that,\" said the customs collector's wife. \"I too come of better stock. My father wove stockings for the King.\"\n\n\"So naturally you married one of the King's officers,\" Holberg said, with a bow to her husband.\n\nTwelfth Night came, and Mother Sören lighted for Holberg a candle of the Three Kings - that is, three small tallow candles - which she herself had prepared.\n\n\"A candle for each man!\" said Holberg.\n\n\"Each man?\" she exclaimed, and looked at him hard.\n\n\"Each of the wise men from the east,\" Holberg said.\n\n\"Oh, that's how you meant it,\" she said, and sat in silence for a while. But on that evening of the Three Kings, he learned a great deal about her that he had not known.\n\n\"You are fond of the man you are wedded to,\" Holberg said, \"yet people tell me he daily mistreated you.\"\n\n\"That concerns no one but me,\" Mother Sören declared. \"The blows would have done me good had they fallen when I was a child. Now they probably fall for my sins. I only know the good he has done me.\" She stood up straight. \"When I lay ill and weak among the sand dunes, and no one would come near me except perhaps the rooks, the crows, and the jackdaws, who came to pick at me, he carried me in his arms, and got hard words for bringing such a find on board his ship. I do not come of sickly stock, so I recovered. All of us have our faults, and Sören has his. One must not judge the horse by his halter. With him I have led a more pleasant life than I did with him whom they called the highest and most gallant one of all the King's men. I have been married to Governor Gyldenlöve, half-brother to the King. Afterward I took Palle Dyre. Good or bad, each has his own way, and I have mine. That was a long story, and now you know it.\"\n\nMother Sören went out of the room.\n\nSo this was Marie Grubbe, so strangely does the ball of fortune turn. She did not live to see many more feasts of the Three Kings. Holberg wrote that she died in June, 1716, but he did not write, for he did not know, that when Mother Sören, as they called her, lay dead in Borrehouse, a flock of large black birds flew over the roof in silence. They did not scream, and it was as if they knew that at funerals one must be quiet. As soon as she was in her grave, the birds departed, but on that same evening the birds were seen in enormous numbers over her old estate in Jutland. Rooks, crows, and jackdaws, screamed to each other as if they had much to tell. Perhaps they croaked of him who robbed them of their eggs and young ones when he was a boy - the peasant boy who received an iron garter on the King's Island - and also of the high-born young lady who died a ferry woman at Grönsund.\n\n\"Bra! Bra!\" they croaked. And \"Bra, Bra!\" the whole tribe croaked when the old castle was torn down. \"And this they cry still, though there is nothing left to croak about,\" said the parish clerk, when he told the story. \"The family died out, the castle was torn down, and where it stood the new hen house now stands, with its gilded weathercock on the roof, and Chicken Grethe inside. There she sits, well satisfied with her cosy residence, for if she had not come here she would have gone to the workhouse!\" - The pigeons cooed above her, the turkeys clucked, and the ducks quacked around her. \"No one knew her,\" they said. \"She had no relatives. By an act of charity she came here, and children she had none!\"\n\nNevertheless, she had ancestors, though she did not know of them, nor did the parish clerk, for all the manuscripts he had in his table drawer. But one of the old crows knew, and he told about it. From its mother and its grandmother, it had heard tell of Chicken Grethe's mother and grandmother, whom we know too. We know how, as a child, she rode over the drawbridge and looked about proudly, as if the whole world and all the bird nests in it belonged to her. We also saw her on the sand dunes, and last at the ferry house. Her granddaughter, last of her line, had come home again where the old castle had stood, and where the wild birds croaked.

      "body": "The Flea And The Professor:\n\nThere was an aëronaut, and things went badly with him. His balloon burst, hurled him out, and went all to pieces. Just two minutes before, the aëronaut had sent his boy down by parachute - wasn't the boy lucky! He wasn't hurt, and he knew enough to be an aëronaut himself, but he had no balloon and no means of getting one.\n\nLive he must, so he took to sleight-of-hand tricks, and to throwing his voice, which is called ventriloquism. He was young and good-looking. When he grew a mustache and wore his best clothes, he might well have been mistaken for the son of a nobleman. Ladies found him handsome and one young lady was so taken by his charm and dexterity that she eloped with him to foreign lands. There he called himself \"The Professor\" - he could scarcely do less.\n\nHe continually thought about how to get himself a balloon and sail through the air with his little wife. But they still lacked the means to do so.\n\n\"That will come yet,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, if only it would,\" said she.\n\n\"We are still young people,\" he said, \"and I'm a Professor.\"\n\n\"Crumbs are also bread!\"\n\nShe helped him all she could, and sat at the door to sell tickets for his entertainments. In the wintertime this was a chilly sort of pleasure. She also helped him with one of his acts. He would put her into a table drawer - a large table drawer - and she would creep into the back drawer. From in front she was not to be seen, and as far as the audience was concerned she was invisible. But one evening, when he pulled out the drawer she was invisible to him too. She was not in the front drawer, not in the back one, and not in the whole house. She was nowhere to be seen or heard, and that was her contribution to the entertainment.\n\nShe never came back. She was tired of it all, and he became tired of it too. He lost his good humor and could not laugh or make jokes, so people stopped coming to see him. His earnings fell off and his clothes wore out, until at last all that he had was a large flea, an heirloom from his wife; that's why he liked it so well. He trained the flea and taught it to perform - to present arms, and to fire off a cannon. Of course it was a very small cannon.\n\nThe Professor was proud of the flea, and the flea was proud of himself. He had learned a thing or two, and had human blood in him. He had been to the largest cities. Princes and Princesses had seen him and given him high praise, which was printed in the newspapers and on the billposters. He knew he was a famous flea who could support a Professor, yes, a whole household.\n\nProud he was and famous he was. Yet when he and the Professor traveled they went by fourth-class railway carriages, which took them along just as quickly as those of the first-class. They made a secret pledge to each other that they would never separate. Neither of them would marry. The flea would remain a bachelor and the Professor a widower. That made them even.\n\n\"Where one has the best luck,\" said the Professor, \"one ought not go back a second time.\" He was a student of human nature, which is a science in itself. At length he had traveled through all countries except the savage ones, and to those he decided to go. There they eat Christian men. The Professor knew this, but then he was not much of a Christian, and the flea was not much of a man, so he thought they might venture successfully into the wilds, and make a lot of money.\n\nThey traveled by steamship and they traveled by sailboat. The flea performed his trick along the way in exchange for free passage, and thus they came to the country of savages. Here a little Princess ruled the land. She was only eight years old, but she ruled just the same. She had taken away the power from her papa and mamma, for she had a will of her own and was uncommonly beautiful, and uncommonly rude.\n\nAs soon as the flea presented arms and fired off his cannon, she took such a fancy to him that she cried, \"Him or nobody!\" She fell madly in love with the flea, and she was already a madcap in all other respects.\n\n\"My sweet, level-headed little child - \" her papa said, \"if only there were some way to make a man of him.\"\n\n\"Leave that to me, old fellow,\" said she, which was no way for a little Princess to talk to her papa, but then she was a savage. She set the flea on her fair hand:\n\n\"Now you are a man, ruling with me, but you must do what I want you to do, or I shall kill you and eat the Professor.\"\n\nThe Professor had a large room to lice in, with walls made of sugar cane. He could have licked them, but he didn't care for sweets. He had a hammock to sleep in, and that reminded him of being in a balloon, where he had always wanted to be. He thought of this continually.\n\nThe flea lived with the Princess. He sat upon her delicate hand or on her fair neck. She had taken a hair from her head and made the Professor fasten it to the flea's leg, and kept it tied to the big red coral pendant which hung from the tip of her ear. What a delightful time the Princess did have, and the flea too, she thought.\n\nThe Professor was not so delighted. He was a traveler, who liked to ride from town to town, and to read in the newspapers about how persevering and ingenious he had been to teach the flea tricks of human behavior. Day in and day out he lay lazily in his hammock. He ate good food: fresh bird's eggs, elephant eyes, and fried giraffe legs. Cannibals do not live entirely on human flesh. No, that is a specisl delicacy!\n\n\"Shoulder of child with pepper sauce,\" said the Princess's mamma, \"is the most delicate.\"\n\nThe Professor was bored with it all, and preferred to leave this savage land, but his flea he must take with him, for it was his wonder and his bread and butter. How could he catch it? How could he get hold of it? This was not an easy thing to do. He racked his wits, and at last he declared:\n\n\"Now I have it! Papa of the Princess, give me something to do. Let me teach your people to present themselves before Your Royal Highness. This is what is known as culture in the great and powerful nations of the earth.\"\n\n\"Can I learn to do that too?\" the Princess's papa asked.\n\n\"It's not quite proper,\" the Professor told him, \"but I shall teach your Savage Papaship to fire off a cannon. It goes off with a bang. One sits high in the air, and then off it goes or down you come.\"\n\n\"Let me bang it off,\" the Princess's papa begged. But in all the land there was no cannon, except the one the flea had brought with him - and that was so tiny.\n\n\"I shall cast a bigger one,\" said the Professor. \"Just give me the means to do so. I must have fine silk cloth, a needle and thread, and rope and cordage, besides stomach drops for the balloon. Stomach drops blow a person up so easily and give one the heaves. They are what make the report in the cannon's stomach.\"\n\n\"By all means.\" The Princess's papa gave him everything that he asked. The whole court, and all the populace gathered together to see the casting of the big cannon. The Profesor did not call them until he had the ballon all ready to be filled and to go up. The flea sat there upon the Princess's hand, and looked on as the ballon was filled. It swelled out and became so violent that they could scarcely hold it down.\n\n\"I must take it up in the air to cool it off,\" said the Professor who took his seat in the basket that hung underneath.\n\n\"But - I cannot steer it alone, I must have a trained companion to help me. There is no one here who can do that except the flea.\" \"I am not at all willing to permit it,\" said the Princes, but she held out her hand and gave the flea to the Professor, who placed it on his wrist.\n\n\"Let go the lines and ropes!\" he shouted. \"Now the balloon is going up.\" They thought he said \"the cannon.\" So the balloon went higher and higher, up above the clouds and far away from that savage land.\n\nThe little Princess, her family, and all of her subjects sat and waited. They are waiting there still, and if you don't believe this, just you take a journey to the country of savages. Every child there is talking about the Professor and the flea, whom they expect back as soon as the cannon cools off.\n\nBut they won't be back. They are at home here with us. They are in their native land. They travel by rail, first-class, not fourth. For they have a great success, an enormous balloon. Nobody asks them how they got their balloon, or where it came from. They are wealthy folk now - oh, most respectable folk - the flea and the Professor."

      "body": "The Jewish Girl:\n\nAmong the other children in the charity school was a little Jewish girl, clever and good-in fact, the brightest of them all. But there was one class she could not attend, the one where religion was taught, for she was in a Christian school.\n\nDuring the hour of this class, she had her geography book before her to study, or did her arithmetic, but the lessons were quickly learned, and then, though the book might still be open before her, she did not read from it; she listened. And the teacher soon noticed that she listened more intently than any of the rest.\n\n\"Study your book,\" said the teacher, gently yet earnestly. But she looked back at him with her black, eager eyes, and when he put his questions to her as well as the rest he found she knew more than all the others. She had listened, understood, and kept his words.\n\nHer father was a poor but honest man, and when he first brought her to the school he had given instructions that she should not be taught the Christian faith. But to send her from the room during the Scripture lesson might have given offense and raised various thoughts in the minds of the other children in the class, and so she remained. But this could not go on any longer.\n\nSo the teacher went to her father and explained that he must either take his daughter away from the school or consent to her becoming a Christian.\n\n\"I cannot bear to see those burning eyes, that sincere yearning thirst of the soul, so to speak, after the words of the Gospel,\" he said.\n\nThen her father burst into tears. \"I know very little myself of our own faith,\" he replied, \"but her mother was a daughter of Israel, strong and steadfast in her faith, and on her deathbed I promised her that our child should never receive Christian baptism. That promise I must keep, for to me it is like a pact with God.\"\n\nSo the little Jewish girl was taken away from the Christian school.\n\nYears had passed.\n\nIn a humble household, in one of the smallest provincial towns of Jutland there was a maidservant, a poor girl of the Jewish faith; this was Sarah. Her hair was as black as ebony, and her eyes were dark yet full of brilliant light, such eyes as you see among the daughters of the East. And the expression in the face of the grown-up girl was still that of the child who sat on the schoolroom bench, listening with eager and wistful eyes.\n\nEvery Sunday the sound of the organ and the singing of the congregation sounded from the church, and the tones floated across the street and into the house where the Jewish girl attended diligently and faithfully to her work. \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" was her law; but her Sabbath was a day of labor to Christians, and only in her heart could she keep it holy. And that she believed was not enough.\n\nBut then the thought came to her soul, \"What do days and hours matter in the sight of God?\" and on the Sunday of the Christians she had her own undisturbed hour of devotion. Then if the sound of the organ and the singing came across to her as she stood behind the sink in the kitchen, even this became a quiet and consecrated spot. Then she would read the treasure and property of her own people, the Old Testament, and that alone; for she kept deep in her heart what her father had told the teacher and herself when she was taken from the school-the promise he had made to her dying mother, \"that Sarah should not be baptized, nor forsake the faith of her fathers.\" The New Testament was, and would forever remain, a sealed book to her; and yet she knew much of it, for it shone through the memories of her childhood.\n\nOne evening she was sitting in a corner of the living room while her master read aloud. She allowed herself to listen, for this was not the Gospel; no, he was reading from an old storybook, so she could remain. The master read to them of a Hungarian knight who was taken captive by a Turkish pasha and yoked with oxen to the plow. He was driven with lashes of the whip and suffered pain and thirst almost beyond endurance.\n\nBut at home his wife sold her jewels and mortgaged their castle and lands, while friends contributed large sums to help raise the almost unbelievable amount of money that was demanded as ransom. This finally was collected, and he was delivered from slavery and disgrace. Sick and suffering, he returned home.\n\nBut soon there resounded over the countryside the summons to a crusade against the foe of Christianity. The sick man heard the call and could have neither peace nor rest any longer; they had to lift him on his war horse. Then the blood rushed again to his cheeks, his strength seemed to return, and he rode forth to victory. The very pasha who had made him suffer pain and humiliation yoked to the plow became his captive. He was taken home to the castle dungeon, but before he had been there an hour the knight came to him and asked his prisoner, \"What do you think now awaits you?\"\n\n\"I know,\" replied the Turk. \"Retribution.\"\n\n\"Yes, the retribution of a Christian,\" said the knight. \"The teachings of Christ tell us to forgive our enemies and love our fellow men. God is love! Go in peace to your home and loved ones, and be gentle and good to all who suffer.\"\n\nThen the prisoner burst into tears. \"How could I have believed such a thing possible?\" he cried. \"I was certain I would have to suffer shame and torture, hence I took poison, and within a few hours I shall die. There is no remedy. But before I die, teach me the faith which is so full of such love and mercy; it is great and divine! In that faith let me die; let me die a Christian!\" And his request was granted him.\n\nThat was the legend, the story that was read to them. All listened to it with close attention, but it sank deepest into the heart of her who sat in the corner, the servantmaid, Sarah, the Jewess. Large tears stood in her sparkling coal-black eyes while she sat there, as years ago on the school bench, and felt the greatness of the Gospel. The tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n\"Let not my child become a Christian!\" Her mother's dying words rang through her soul with those of the law, \"Honor thy father and thy mother!\"\n\n\"Still I have not been baptized! They call me 'the Jewess'; the boys of the neighborhood mocked me last Sunday as I stood outside the church door and looked in at the burning altar lights and the singing congregation. Ever since my school days, up to this very hour, the power of Christianity, which is like a sunbeam, and which, no matter how much I close my eyes, penetrates into my heart. But, my mother, I will not bring you sorrow in your grave! I will not betray the promise my father made to you; I will not read the Christian's Bible! Have I not the God of my fathers? On Him let me rest my head!\"\n\nAnd the years rolled by.\n\nThe husband died, and the wife was left in difficult circumstances. The servant girl had to be dismissed, but Sarah would not leave the widow. She became her help in time of trouble and kept the little household together; she worked late every night, and by the labor of her own hands got bread for the house. There were no close relatives to help a family where the widow grew weaker each day, lingering for months on a sickbed. Gentle and good Sarah watched and nursed and labored and was the blessing of the poverty-stricken home.\n\n\"There is the Bible,\" said the sick woman one evening. \"Read a little to me; the evening is so long, and I sadly need to hear the word of God.\"\n\nSarah bowed her head, picked up the Bible and folded her hands around it, opened it, and read aloud to the sick woman. Often the tears came into her eyes, but they shone more clearly, and the darkness lifted from her soul. \"Mother, your child shall not receive the baptism of the Christians, shall not be named in their communion. You have wished it, and I shall honor your wish. In this we are united here on earth, but above this is-is a greater union in God. He leads and guides us beyond Death. 'I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.' Oh, I understand now! I do not know myself how I came to it! Through Him it was-in Him-Christ!\"\n\nAnd she trembled as she spoke the holy name; a baptism of fire streamed through her, stronger than her feeble frame could bear, and she sank down, more exhausted even than the sick woman whom she nursed.\n\n\"Poor Sarah!\" people said. \"She is worn out with labor and nursing!\"\n\nThey took her to the charity hospital, and there she died, and thence she was carried to her grave. It was not to the graveyard of the Christians-that was not the place for a Jewish girl; no, outside by the wall they dug a grave for her.\n\nBut God's sun, which shines upon the graves of the Christians, shines as well upon that of the Jewish girl; and the hymns which are sung beside the Christian graves sound also beside her grave outside the wall. And out there, too, reaches the promise: \"There is resurrection in Christ, in Him, the Saviour, who said to His Disciples, 'John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holv (NB = Holy) Ghost!' \""

There lived a fox too which longed to eat the plumpy and healthy deer. “Yummy it will be if I have this deer for lunch. First, I should win the confidence of the deer,” the sly fox thought.\n\nThe next day, the fox came to the place where the deer and the crow were chatting as usual. “Hi, I have seen you many days together and I wish to be your friend!” he said. To this, the crow said, “Sorry, how can you be friendly with us!” The fox was really clever and cross-questioned him, “Why can’t a fox be a friend with a crow and deer? Please give me a chance to prove myself. I will be a good friend!”\n\nAlthough the clever fox couldn’t convince the crow, the deer was almost convinced with his words. The deer said to the crow, “Oh, he seems to be nice. We can meet him as a friend!” “Are you in your senses? It’s not possible!” shouted the crow. “That’s okay friends! I’ll take your leave!” said the fox calmly and immediately left from there.\n\nThe next day when the deer was alone, the fox came and started talking to the deer in a very sweet tone. “Hi, there’s a farm nearby where crops are in abundant. You can have fresh, green leaves if you go there,” suggested the fox, The deer fell for the words of the fox and changed its mind. “Okay, let’s go!” agreed deer. Soon, the fox took the deer to that field and the deer jumped with joy.\n\nWhen it saw the field, it went hopping and started eating the grass happily. “Oh, thank you! I had my fill. Let’s go back to the jungle,” said the deer. The fox thought for a while and implemented its second plan. It said ill about the crow and the deer stopped meeting the crow. From then on, both the fox and the deer went together to the field.\n\nThose crops belonged to a farmer. One day as he was surveying his field, he saw that his field was destroyed. He became very angry and soon identified the footsteps of the deer. Immediately, he made a plan to catch the deer and spread the net all over the field.\n\nThe next day, the deer, as usual, came to the field, only to be trapped in the net spread by the farmer. The deer was trapped at once as it entered the field. The fox was very happy to see this as it was the part of his plan. “My lunch is waiting for me,” the fox thought to himself with his mouth watered. The excited fox suddenly went behind a tree to hide.\n\nMeanwhile, the crow happened to flew above the farm. “Looks like my friend! She’s in trouble. I need to help her,” the crow said to himself. “Oh, my friend! Forgive me! I deserve this for not listening to you. You’ve warned me against the fox,” cried the deer.\n\nAs the farmer was approaching the field, the crow told him to pretend as if it was dead. According to their plan, the crow pricked the eyes of the deer. Soon, the farmer thought that the deer is dead. The moment, the farmer took the net, the deer ran as fast as it could. The crow saved the deer and they became the best friends once again.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: YOU SHOULD NEVER TRUST STRANGERS AND ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR NEAR AND DEAR ONES."

It was not an easy life but they had each other. So, the boy didn’t mind that his clothes were torn and he had few toys. The boy had a secret wish. He had always wanted a drum.\n\nOne day, when his mother was going to the village to sell some of their grains, she asked, “Is there anything you would like from the market?” The boy thought and said, “All I would really like is a drum. I know you can’t get me one but that’s what I want most of all.” The poor woman thought of her son all the way home from the market and was sad she couldn’t get him the one thing that he really wanted.\n\nShe started to cry to herself as she walked home. Not seeing where she was going, she almost fell over a strange little man sitting by the side of the road. “Why are you crying?” asked the strange little man. The woman told him her problem. The man gave her a piece of wood and said, “Maybe your boy would like this stick. It may have some magic in it!” “It is not much but perhaps my good son can find a use for it,” she thought.\n\nThe boy didn’t know what to do with the stick when his mother gave it to him. She told him what the strange little man had said. He thanked her and went out to play.\n\nOn the road, the boy could see an old woman by a cook stove. The woman wanted to to light a fire so she could cook bread. The wood was too new and would not catch fire. Lots of smoke hung around her. Her eyes were wet and the boy asked why she was crying. “I can’t get my fire to burn,” said the woman. “Here,” said the boy, giving her his stick, “Perhaps, this will work. My mother told me this stick has some magic in it and maybe there’s enough magic to start your fire!” The old woman started the fire. She thanked the boy giving him some bread that she cooked on her stove.\n\nThe boy took the bread and walked on until he met another woman who was the wife of the village potter. A small child was in her arms but the child was crying loudly and would not stop. The boy spoke up so he could be heard. “Why is your child crying?” he asked. The potter’s wife answered, “He’s hungry. We have nothing for him to eat.” The boy looked at the bread he was holding in his hand. Then, gave to the hungry child. As thanks, the happy mother gave the boy a large pot.\n\nThe boy came to a river where he a man and woman yelling. “Why are you yelling?” asked the boy. “I’m a washerman,” the man replied, “and my wife has just broken the only pot I had to boil clothes in. I’ll never get the clothing clean now.” The boy knew he could help the man and he gave them his pot.. “Thank you very much,” the washerman said. And he gave the boy a coat for being so nice.\n\nThe boy walked on until he came to a man with a horse on the road. The man  wore sandals on his feet and was only wearing underwear. His hair was wet and he was shivering. The boy asked, “What happened to your clothes and why are you all wet?” “I was on my way to visit my family when a robber rode up to this horse,” the man replied. “He said I must give him my best clothes and money. Then, he pushed me in the river.” The boy handed the man the coat that the washerman had given him. The man put on the coat and said, “Please, take this horse. I have no use for it!” \n\nThe boy took the horse and kept walking down the road. He came to a wedding party made up of the bridegroom, his family and some musicians with their instruments. But there was no music. They were all seated in the shade of a small tree and they looked very unhappy. “Why do you all look so sad?” the boy asked. “The father of the bridegroom spoke up, “We’re waiting for the man who is bringing the horse my son will ride. He’s very late and if my son can’t ride the horse during the wedding march, his marriage will have bad luck!”\n\nThe boy listened to the story and decided to give bridegroom the horse. “You saved the day,” the groom exclaimed. The groom spoke to his father and one of the musicians. Then, he handed the boy a drum, “Please, take this drum with all our thanks.” The boy’s face lit up with joy. “Oh, thank you! It’s what I always wanted,” said the boy.\n\nThe boy ran all the way home as fast as he could. He could not wait to show his mother that the strange little man was right. That old piece of wood did have a magic after all."

Father, I want to be an archer replied Eklavya, I want to become a disciple of the great Dronacharya, the great tutor of Archery in Hastinapura. His Gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors\n\nEklavya saw his father was silent. He continued, Father, I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. So please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of Dronacharya\n\nEklavya’s father was troubled, for he knew that his son s ambition was not an easy one. But the chief was a loving father and he did not want to refuse his only son s wish. So the kind man gave his blessings and sent his son on his way to Drona s Gurukul\n\nEklavya set on his way. Soon he reached the part of the forest where Drona taught the princes of Hastinapur\n\nIn those days, there was no such system as a school, college, university or hostel. The only place where one could get some education was a Gurukul . A Gurukul (Guru refers to \"teacher\" or \"master\", Kul refers to his domain, from the Sanskrit word kula, meaning extended family.) is a type of ancient Hindu school in India that is residential in nature with the shishyas or students and the guru or teacher living in proximity, many a time within the same house. The Gurukul is the place where the students resided together as equals, irrespective of their social standing. The students learned from the guru and also helped the guru in his day-to-day life, including the carrying out of mundane chores such as washing clothes, cooking, etc. The education imparted thus, was a wholesome one\n\nHaving said this much, let us now return to Eklavya. When the boy reached Dronacharya s Gurukul, he saw that it consisted of a group of huts, surrounded by trees and an archery yard. The disciples were practicing to shoot arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. It was an engaging sight. But Eklavya s eyes searched Drona. Where was he? Will he be able to see the man? Without Drona, all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless. But all his worries soon subsided. He did not have to wait for long. There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy, who was none else than the third Pandava prince Arjuna, as Eklavya came to know later. Though Eklavya had never seen Drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near Drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? he asked\n\n\"Dronacharya, I am Eklavya, son of the Tribal Chief in the western part of the forests of Hastinapura.\" Eklavya replied. \"Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of Archery.\"    Drona sighed. \"Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a Shudra, the lowest social community according to the Vedic Caste System. I am a Brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a Shudra boy\" he said\n\n\"And he’s also a Royal teacher,\" interrupted Prince Arjuna. \"Our Guru has been appointed by the King to train us, the princes and the highborn. How dare you come inside the Gurukul and seek him? Leave! NOW!\" he spat out, looking enraged that Eklavya had disturbed his practice\n\nEklavya was stunned at Arjuna’s behavior. He himself was the son of the chief of his clan, but he never insulted anyone below him in such a way. He looked at Drona for some kind of support, but the sage remained silent. The message was loud and clear. Dronacharya also wanted him to leave. He refused to teach him\n\nThe innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by Drona’s refusal to teach him. \"It’s not fair!\" he thought miserably. \"God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind.\"    He left the place with a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth. But it could not shatter his ambition to learn Archery. He was still as determined to learn Archery\n\n\"I may be a Shudra but does it make any difference?\" thought he. \" I am as strong and zealous as Drona’s princes and disciples. If I practice the art everyday, I can surely become an archer.\"    Eklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of Dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his Guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his Guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his Guru\n\nDay after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of Drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed Eklavya the mere tribal hunter into Eklavya the extraordinary archer. Eklavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, superior even to Drona’s best pupil, Arjuna\n\nOne day while Eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first the boy ignored the dog, but continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, Eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog’s mouth without injuring it. As a result it roamed the forests with its mouth opened\n\nBut Eklavya was not alone in his practice. He was unaware of the fact that just some distance away, the Pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. As fate would have it, that day, they had come with their teacher, Drona, who was instructing them about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle\n\nAs they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the \"stuffed\" dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too.\" Such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer.\" he exclaimed. He told the Pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was Eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him\n\n\"Your aim is truly remarkable!\" Drona praised Eklavya, and asked \"From whom did you learn Archery?\" Eklavya was thrilled to hear Drona’s praises. How surprised he will be if he told Drona that he, in fact was his Guru! \"From you my Master. You are my Guru,\" Eklavya replied humbly\n\n\"Your Guru? How can I be your Guru? I have never seen you before!\" Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his Gurukul several months ago. \" Now I remember,\" said he. \"Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my Gurukul some months back?\"    \"Yes, Dronacharya\", replied the boy. \"After I left your Gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshipped it every day. I practiced before your image. You refused to teach me, but your statue did not. Thanks to it, I have become a good archer.\"    Hearing this, Arjuna became angry. \"But you promised me that you’d make me the best archer in the world!\" he accused Drona. \"Now how can that be? Now a common hunter has become better than me!\"    The other princes remembered their master frequently praising Arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now?    Unable to answer Arjuna’s question, Drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to Prince Arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with Eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish Eklavya\n\n\"Where is your guru dakhsina? You have to give me a gift for your training,\" the sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make Eklavya suffer for his disobedience. \n\nEklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina was the voluntary fee or gift offered by a disciple to his guru at the end of his training. The guru-shishya parampara, i.e. the teacher-student tradition, was a hallowed tradition in Hinduism. At the end of a shishya’s study, the guru asks for a \"guru dakshina,\" since a guru does not take fees. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all. \n\n\"Dronacharya, I’ll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. Ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina \"he said. \"I might ask something you don’t like to give me. What if you refuse the dhakshina I want?\" Drona asked cunningly. \n\nEklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru’s dakshina was refused. \"No! How can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I’ll never refuse anything you ask, Dronacharya,\" promised the unsuspecting boy. \n\nDrona did not wait anymore. \"Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina\" he declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even Arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy?  \nFor a moment Eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. \"Ok Gurudev, as you wish.\" said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, Eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb!  \nThe princes gasped at Eklavya’s act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain, and held out his severed thumb to Dronacharya. \n\n\"Here is my guru dakshina, Drona\", Ekalavya said. \"I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I’m a mere Shudra hunter.\"  \nThe sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. \"Eklavya, even with out your thumb, you’ll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru,\" Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to Arjuna was not broken. The Gods blessed Eklavya from above. \n\nBut despite his handicap, Eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, Eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When Drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness. \n\nAnd true to Drona’s blessing, Eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of Mahabharatha."

Someone says from this phenomenon was born the word \"universe\": unique and different.\n\nAnyway, this light ruled without rivals: there was not night, and there was not shadow. Not even a very tiny, like those that run away from children who can fly. After many years, something happened. Something very strange and misterious. Something so enigmatic that no one could explains.\n\nScientists, teachers, historians, brains, misfits tried but no one could understood. Anyway, after this... thing... the world was not made just of light anymore. From that time, there was the dark too. And with it, night and shadow. In one place one businnessman (that one can be called \"borrower\") invented a dynamo: a bike that goes nowhere. You turn the pedals, but you cannot move. In exchange, the dynamo makes light. Sweat for turn on the bulb light.\n\nThe businnessman was very happy for this invention: he can read his newspaper in the night; not so happy was the worker, wich worked and sweated hard for the light, without moving anywhere. How much as, in the day, when there was the light he can not moves either, because he was too tired. In other place, a group of men very sad for this situation (the dark) decided to organize some meetings for talk about that. But, to be honest, they didn't talk, they just complained and cannot reach an outcome. They lamented about their complaints.\n\nAnyway, I must say that they were very good in complaints: they took those meetings very seriously, as much that, neither in the day they stopped to talking and wasting their times, so in their minds were not sun either in day-long. In one other place again, a group of women took the situation in the same way: organization of meetings, talking searching a solution. But, after few days, they did not found a solution so took it easy: they speaks, plays and do things in the day-long, and sleep in the night.\n\nIn the north of the northern country, there was a brilliant inventor that invented (pretty obvious) a magic and special membrane that lights in the dark. But for pity this guy is very selfish, and very jealous about his idea, so he hid the magic membrane and never sharing it to another.\n\nAt last, in the south of the southern country there was a children named Zaid that became friend of bees and, after asked them some wax, made many candle. In the night, he brings the candles in his village and sharing these to all his friends. Oh, that is really a very beautifull experience, you should see... In fact, in the night all the Zaid's village mets, and formes a circle and the children lights his candle, then, he puts the flame on the wick of his nearest friend's candle and this guy do the same thing... after few minutes, all the circle is bright and brilliant and it stoles the light from the night, as like there was the sun at midnight.?"

The elder was afraid his brother would get a greater share of the crop, so he told his wife to make the younger couple live apart. The elder was very greedy and claimed homes, fields, gardens, and cattles left by his parents. He left his younger brother only a tiny home and a small piece of land with a single star fruit tree.\n\nBut the younger one hardly complained as he was very kind. He took good care of his star fruit tree, watered it every day and worked hard. The star fruit tree fruited unusually well that year. All its branches were weighed down with ripe fruits. The younger couple was very happy. They hoped to trade the star fruits for rice.\n\nOne day, a big raven landed in the tree and ate the fruits. The younger brother sent the bird away. Suddenly, it said, “Star fruits I eat, with gold I pay!

      "body": "Naughty Noel:\n\nNot everyone can say their dad is Santa—not like the little boy over there in the schoolhouse window.  Third-grade classroom, second row from the back, the one doodling on his boot.  He may not have the belly or the beard yet, but that birds’ nest of hair you see has kept as white as freshly-fallen snow since the day he was born.  His name is Noel.  Noel Claus.  And up here at The Pole his dad is known as “The Big Guy.”\n\nIt’s not something he likes to talk about, and I’m guessing that has more to do with shame than humility.  You see, Noel Claus is a troublemaker.\n\nIn the short eight years of his life Noel has managed to spend six on the naughty list.  Although we all remember that one Christmas when he switched the two lists around.  Good little girls and boys all over the world ended up with coal in their stockings and tears in their eyes because of that prank.  If you’ve ever gotten a lump of the black stuff, perhaps it was Noel’s fault.  If not, well, then you lucked out that year you were naughty.\n\nLump of coal as a present\n\nSometimes Noel’s temper can be so short it makes folks wonder whether his terrible twos ever really ended, and if he might not still be teething.  Others whisper that he’s only so bad because he prefers coal to toys.  That’s a bit of an exaggeration—no kid wants a lump of coal—but he sure can be contrary when he feels like it.  Donner Fielding once suggested he spell his name backwards and call himself Leon on account of being so contrary.  Noel snarled and agreed, then sent Don home with a big old charley horse on his arm to help the kid remember to mind his own business.\n\nNoel has always been a bit of a loner.  Sure he’s different than the others—he’s the only one in school who isn’t an elf, though it’s not that obvious to look at him.  Plenty of elves have white hair just like his—take Holly Tinsel, for instance, the girl who sits in front of Noel—and though they do have pointy ears, none of them are quite so diminutive as all the stories like to make out.  Some, indeed, tower to nearly a quarter of my own height, and only need two ladders to fix my star.\n\nTree named Yule in Naught Noel by Nathan Oser\n\nMy name is Yule, and if you thought there was a barber pole at the very center of town, you were wrong.  It’s just me, the oldest Christmas tree in history, twenty five feet tall, planted by The Big Guy himself (a couple generations back, anyway).  With the help of my diligent little pinecones I act as warden to the town, “guarding the goods” as The Missus might say, and lighting up The Pole with holiday spirit.  To put it simply, I’m a watchman.  And lately I’ve been watching Noel.  Something tells me that boy is due for a change.\n\nSee what I mean for yourself, there in the snowy window.  Ms. Vonden is about to administer a science test.  “You’re going to have to change, Noel, before we begin,” she says.\n\n“Change?”\n\n“Seats and boots.”\n\nThe boy lets loose a big old huff and a frown.  He stands and slogs toward a desk out in the hall—his usual test-taking seat—where his eyes can’t wander forward to Holly’s like they so often do.  “But I don’t have another pair, Ms. Vonden,” he says.  “I only got a lump of coal for Christmas last year.  No new boots.”\n\n“Then next time you write test answers on your soles, don’t use permanent ink.  You can have them back at the end of the day.”\n\nNight falls early up here at The Pole.  Three o’clock when it gets this close to Christmas.  Let me turn on my lights so we can see what happens after school.\n\nJust as I suspected.  While all the other kids come bursting out the big front doors with the cheerful chime of the bell, Noel comes stomping out slowly, deliberately, with his boots knotted together and slung over a shoulder.  Out of spite he walks all the way home through the freezing snow in sock-feet.  It doesn’t matter if Ms. Vonden notices or not—it’s all in his head.  And in case you’re curious, my pinecones tell me he failed the test.\n\nWhen he reaches home the first thing he does is check the mailbox, which at the Claus residence is no ordinary mailbox.  It’s a huge old tin affair always stuffed full with handwritten letters, postmarked from all across the globe—a few even from The Pole.  Actually, I think I recognize the return address of the one there at the end of the stack.  Yes, it’s from the Tinsel place, the best-decorated house in town, out near the iceskating lake.\n\nNoel 3 Naughty Noel by Nathan Oser\n\nNormally this is about the time when Noel picks up a fistful of snow and shoves it in to melt atop the letters.  Today, though, something stops him.  He pulls the big stack of envelopes from the mailbox and carries them inside.  A few minutes later he comes back out, socks changed and coat pockets heavy and bulging with some mysterious clumpy objects—the beginnings of some new mischief is all I can guess.  And isn’t that the torn edge of a single envelope poking out the side of one pocket there?  Just what is he up to?\n\nOut back of the Claus’s is The Workshop where all the Christmas magic happens, and Noel slips in through the service door.\n\nHear the machines creaking and cranking and the banging of the elves’ hammers?  It’s business as usual, Santa and his helpers all putting in overtime.  Why don’t I send out a couple of my pinecones so we can follow what goes on inside before the break whistle blows and supper starts?\n\nNoel 4 Naughty Noel by Nathan Oser\n\nHow’s that?  Can you see Noel sitting down at a workbench with his mom and dad and a few of the elves?  They’re all eating their TV dinners and Noel starts to lie about how well his test went at school today.\n\n“Way to go!” his dad bellows, dimples forming in his rosy cheeks.\n\nNoel consults his boots a few times to tell them what he learned.\n\n“That’s absolutely wonderful, dear,” his mom says.  “I never knew certain frogs didn’t have tongues!”\n\n“Keep it up, son, and you’ll have to write me a letter of all the presents you want this Christmas.”\n\nNoel turns his head down at this and quietly finishes his food.  He’s heard the old song enough times to feel bad about lying now:  “He sees you when you’re sleeping, he knows when you’re awake, he knows…”\n\nAnd then everyone goes back to work.\n\nNoel hangs out for a while to watch his dad oversee and arrange the inventory, then leaves so he won’t be in the way.\n\nNo one blames Noel’s parents for how naughty he is, least of all Noel.  It’s understood that they have an important job to do.  From the look in his eyes you can tell Noel loves them too, and wants nothing more than to be like his dad.  His pops casts a long shadow, though, that’s for sure.  And with so many children counting on The Big Guy—with so many expectations—it’s hard for him to please everyone at once.  It’s pretty hard for Noel too.\n\nThe lumps are still there, heavy in his coat pockets when he steps back outside into the cold—I wonder what they are.  He strolls around town for a while, past the candy cane shop and the glitter store, then stops when he reaches a house lit up nearly as bright as I am with dozens of strings of old-fashioned Christmas lights.  There’s a sign in the front yard that says “Festival of Lights FIRST PRIZE.”  And the mailbox reads “Tinsel.”  That’s Holly’s last name.  Could that opened letter in his pocket be hers?\n\nNoel knocks on the door after going down the long path of lights and ribbons and electric reindeer.  It’s Holly’s mom who answers.  “Noel?  Hi, there.  What can I do for you?”\n\nNoel kicks his foot back and forth in the snow on the porch and looks up at the icicles on the eaves.  “Is Holly home?” he asks.\n\n“Sorry, dear.  She said she’d be outside somewhere, building a snowman.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nNoel leaves and heads for the skating lake so he can walk through the deep snowbanks and take measurements on his pants legs.  He pretends they’re dipsticks in a car motor.  It’s a game he likes to play by himself, and after so many winters his balance is impeccable.  Foot in, foot out, foot in, foot out.  He only has two feet, but he’s already three feet deep.  Then he edges close to the icy lake and pulls a dark object from his coat pocket.  He tosses it up and down a few times to feel the heft of it.\n\nCould it be?\n\nA lump of coal.\n\nI should have known!\n\nAfter a long moment of contemplation—almost as if he were taking time to say goodbye to the thing—he wings it over the frozen lake.  He takes out another from a different pocket.  He throws all six of them, one by one, into the dark center of the ice and lets out a big sigh when he’s done.\n\nA few steps back in the other direction he hears a CRACK!  He looks up for falling tree branches, but there are none.  BANG!  The sky is cloudy, but there’s no thunder.  CRUNCH!\n\nHe finally turns, only to see the ice is breaking all up and down the lake.  And there—I don’t know how he spotted it before I did—in the center of the lake is the silhouette of a little girl, stuck in one of the fissures and sinking into the icy water!\n\nNoel 5 Naughty Noel by Nathan Oser\n\nNoel dashes free of the snowdrift without loosing his footing and without a second thought.  He slips and slides across the flimsy, fractured ice, and heads for the girl.  It looks like Holly—Noel has spent countless lessons staring forward at her when he should have been paying attention to the teacher, and her mom said she was playing outside, didn’t she?   Now she’s calling out to him for help.  Or could it be just another scream coming from the splintering ice?\n\nNoel barely makes it to the center of the lake before Holly is gone.  He darts a hand out for hers and takes hold of a mitten.  He yanks with all his might and tumbles back on his britches.  When he looks a second time, though, he sees the dark figure is still sinking into the lake and all he saved was an arm—the arm of a snowman.\n\nAfter shaking off the shock he tosses the mittened stick aside and rises to his feet.  The head of the snowman sinks completely out of sight.  It wasn’t Holly.  It looked like her though.  It really did.\n\nWith the ice still letting out loud, angry pops and freight train shrills, Noel goes racing in zigs and zags around the cracks, and leaps into the snowbank.  Just in time!  From the safety of solid ground he watches as the last of the ice splits apart and falls like the opened lid of a soup can into the murk.\n\nHe might have been a hero for saving the life of a little girl, but he wasn’t.  No one had been around to see him, and all he’d saved was the twiggy arm of a snowman.  He realizes it must have been the one Holly built.  And they must have just missed each other going the other way.  His muscles relax at the thought that she’s probably already at home by now, sitting snug and warm by the fire.\n\nBut would you look at that!  Now that he’s caught his breath and is coming back into town, doesn’t his chin look a bit higher than before?  And he’s smiling!  A real smile, equal parts relief, confidence, and pride, I believe.  He would have saved Holly, after all, if it was her.  But he didn’t have to, and it didn’t matter if anyone saw or not.\n\nSomething inside him has definitely changed.  I can almost feel it as he stops beneath me and stares up at my shining gold star.\n\nA minute or two passes and he’s still there, looking about at all my sparkling ornaments.  He reaches up to put a hand on a low-hanging nutcracker, then moves the hand over to a red-ribboned sprig of mistletoe.  He plucks it from the branch and conceals it in his pocket.  And as he does, the torn letter from earlier, half sticking out, falls to the ground.\n\nBut he’s gone, back in the direction of the lake and the brightest house in town, before he can realize he dropped it.  What do you say we take a peak?\n\nDear Santa, it says.\n\nI don’t really want any toys for Christmas this year.  Not that I don’t appreciate all your gifts!  I do!  But I thought of something that would make me even happier this Christmas.  We all know Noel can be naughty at times, but I think he’s really nice at heart.  Have you ever seen him playing in the snow by himself, buried up to his waist?  Of course you have.  You know everything!  Maybe you and I could be a little naughty and break the rules this year, and you could give him my present instead.  Thanks, Santa!\n\nSincerely,\n\nHolly Tinsel\n\nHeart-warming, isn’t it?  I’ll bet I know where Noel is taking that mistletoe.  I’ll bet, too, that it’s not the last gift he ever gives—this year, or the next, or for many many years to come.\n\nIt’s going to be a merry Christmas, folks.  And happy new year!"

      "body": "Mother Holle:\n\nThere was once a widow who had two daughters—one of whom was pretty and hard-working, while the other was ugly and lazy. But she was much fonder of the ugly and lazy one, because she was her own daughter; and the other, who was a step-daughter, had to do all the work, and be the Cinderella of the house. Every day the poor girl had to sit by a well, in the highway, and spin and spin till her fingers bled.\n\nNow it happened that one day the shuttle, which an important part on a spinning wheel, was marked with her blood, so she dipped it in the well, to wash the mark off; but it dropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom. She began to cry, and ran to her step-mother and told of the mishap. But she scolded her sharply, and was so merciless as to say, “Since you have let the shuttle fall in, you must fetch it out again.”\n\nSo the girl went back to the well, and did not know what to do; and in the sorrow of her heart she jumped into the well to get the shuttle. She lost her senses; and when she awoke and came to herself again, she was in a lovely meadow where the sun was shining and many thousands of flowers were growing. Along this meadow she went, and at last came to a baker’s oven full of bread, and the bread cried out, “Oh, take me out! take me out! or I shall burn; I have been baked a long time!” So she went up to it, and took out all the loaves one after another with the bread-shovel. After that she went on till she came to a tree covered with apples, which called out to her, “Oh, shake me! shake me! we apples are all ripe!” So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain, and went on shaking till they were all down, and when she had gathered them into a heap, she went on her way.\n\nAt last she came to a little house, out of which an old woman peeped; but she had such large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was about to run away.\n\nBut the old woman called out to her, “What are you afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do all the work in the house properly, you shall be the better for it. Only you must take care to make my bed well, and to shake it thoroughly till the feathers fly—for then there is snow on the earth. I am Mother Holle.”\n\nAs the old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl took courage and agreed to enter her service. She attended to everything to the satisfaction of her mistress, and always shook her bed so vigorously that the feathers flew about like snow-flakes. So she had a pleasant life with her; never an angry word; and boiled or roast meat every day.\n\nShe stayed some time with Mother Holle, and then she became sad. At first she did not know what was the matter with her, but found at length that it was homesickness; although she was many times better off here than at home, still she had a longing to be there. At last she said to the old woman, “I have a longing for home; and however well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer; I must go up again to my own people.” Mother Holle said, “I am pleased that you long for your home again, and as you have served me so truly, I myself will take you up again.” Thereupon she took her by the hand, and led her to a large door. The door was opened, and just as the maiden was standing beneath the doorway, a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the gold remained sticking to her, so that she was completely covered with it.\n\n“You shall have that because you are so hard-working,” said Mother Holle; and at the same time she gave her back the shuttle which she had let fall into the well. Thereupon the door closed, and the maiden found herself up above upon the earth, not far from her mother’s house.\n\nAnd as she went into the yard the cock cried: “Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your golden girl’s come back to you!”\n\nSo she went in to her mother, and as she arrived thus covered with gold, she was well received, both by her and her sister.\n\nThe girl told all that had happened to her; and as soon as the mother heard how she had come by so much wealth, she was very anxious to obtain the same good luck for the ugly and lazy daughter. She had to seat herself by the well and spin; and in order that her shuttle might be stained with blood, she stuck her hand into a thorn-bush and pricked her finger. Then she threw her shuttle into the well, and jumped in after it.\n\nShe came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow and walked along the very same path. When she got to the oven the bread again cried, “Oh, take me out! take me out! or I shall burn; I have been baked a long time!” But the lazy thing answered, “As if I had any wish to make myself dirty!” and on she went. Soon she came to the apple-tree, which cried, “Oh, shake me! shake me! we apples are all ripe!” But she answered, “I like that! one of you might fall on my head,” and so went on.\n\nWhen she came to Mother Holle’s house she was not afraid, for she had already heard of her big teeth, and she hired herself to her immediately.\n\nThe first day she forced herself to work hard, and obeyed Mother Holle when she told her to do anything, for she was thinking of all the gold that she would give her. But on the second day she began to be lazy, and on the third day still more so, and then she would not get up in the morning at all. Neither did she make Mother Holle’s bed as she ought, and did not shake it so as to make the feathers fly up. Mother Holle was soon tired of this, and gave her notice to leave. The lazy girl was willing enough to go, and thought that now the golden rain would come. Mother Holle led her, too, to the great door; but while she was standing beneath it, instead of the gold, black tar was emptied over her. “That is the reward of your service,” said Mother Holle, and shut the door.\n\nSo the lazy girl went home; but she was quite covered with tar, and the cock by the well-side, as soon as he saw her, cried: “Cock-a-doodle-doo! Your tarred girl’s come back to you.” But the tar stuck fast to her, and could not be got off for a very long time."

      "body": "Why Dogs Live Less Than Human!:\n\nBeing a veterinarian, I had been called to examine a ten-year-old Irish Wolfhound named Belker. The dog’s owners, Ron, his wife, Lisa, and their little boy, Shane, were all very attached to Belker and they were hoping for a miracle.\n\nI examined Belker and found he was dying. I told the family we couldn’t do anything for Belker and offered to perform the euthanasia procedure for the old dog in their home.\n\nAs we made arrangements, Ron and Lisa told me they thought it would be good for six-year-old Shane to observe the procedure. They felt as though Shane might learn something from the experience.\n\nThe next day, I felt the familiar catch in my throat as Belker’s family surrounded him. Shane seemed so calm, petting the old dog for the last time, that I wondered if he understood what was going on. Within a few minutes, Belker slipped peacefully away.\n\nThe little boy seemed to accept Belker’s transition without any difficulty or confusion. We sat together for a while after Belker’s death, wondering aloud about the sad fact that animal lives are shorter than human lives. Shane, who had been listening quietly, piped up, “I know why.”\n\nStartled, we all turned to him. What came out of his mouth next stunned me. I’d never heard a more comforting explanation.\n\nHe said, “People are born so that they can learn how to live a good life — like loving everybody all the time and being nice, right?” The six-year-old continued, “Well, dogs already know how to do that, so they don’t have to stay as long.”\n---\n\nIf a dog was your teacher, these are some of the lessons you might learn:\n\n- When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.\n- Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.\n- Thrive on attention and let people touch you.\n- When you’re happy, dance around and wag your entire body.\n- Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.\n- Never pretend to be something you’re not.\n- If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.\n- When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by, and nuzzle them gently."

      "body": "Story Of Abraham And Sarah And Hagar:\n\n Long, long time passed and Abraham and Sarah did not have any children as God had promised them. Sarah was impatient and so she sent her maid, Hagar to Abraham and said, “Have a baby with Hagar and if she has a son, we can raise him as ours.”\n\nSoon, Hagar and Abraham had a baby boy and named him Ishmael. But he was not a part of God’s plan. Few days later after this, Sarah had a son just as God promised as she named him Isaac which means laughter. Sarah had laughed once when God said that she would have a baby. Once Isaac was born, Sarah became jealous of Hagar and her son.\n\nOne day, Abraham threw a party for young Isaac where Sarah heard Ishmael making fun of Isaac. She became very angry. She told Abraham, “Send Hagar and her son away. I don’t want Ishmael to share my Isaac’s inheritance.” This made Abraham very upset. Ishmael was his son too.\n\nGod told Abraham that it’s okay to send Hagar and Ishmael away. “Isaac is the promised son,” God said. “But I promise to watch over Hagar and Ishmael and even build the nation Ishmael’s descendants because he is your son too.”\n\nThe next day, Abraham got up early in the morning and gathered food and water for Hagar to take as she and Ishmael left. He was sad to send them away. Hagar and Ishmael wandered for days and had nowhere to go. Soon, the water they had brought ran out. Hagar left Ishmael sitting in the shade of the bush and walked a short distance away from him.\n\nShe sat down and thought to herself, “I can’t stand and watch my son die,” and tears rolled down her face. Meanwhile, Ishmael was crying and God heard him. God’s angel came to Hagar and said, “Don’t be afraid Hagar. God has heard your son’s cries and promises to make him into a great nation. Go and comfort your little boy!” The angel vanished. Suddenly, a well appeared in front of Hagar which was full of water.She filled the jar and gave Ishmael a drink.\n\nAfter wandering the wilderness for many days, Ishmael and Hagar finally settled in the Desert of Paran. There, he became an expert in archery. Years passed and Ishmael grew up to become a strong, young man and he married an Egyptian woman. Soon, the couple was blessed with the twelve sons and they lived happily."

      "body": "How To Turn Your Weaknesses Into Strengths:\n\nThis is a story of one 10-year-old boy who decided to study judo despite the fact that he had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident.\n\nThe boy began lessons with an old Japanese judo master. The boy was doing well, so he couldn’t understand why, after three months of training, the master had taught him only one move. “Sensei,” the boy finally said, “Shouldn’t I be learning more moves?”\n\n“This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you’ll ever need to know,” the Sensei replied. Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training.\n\nSeveral months later, the Sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.\n\nThis time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be over-matched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the Sensei intervened. “No,” the Sensei insisted, “Let him continue.”\n\nSoon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament. He was the champion.\n\nOn the way home, the boy and Sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind. “Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?”\n\n“You won for two reasons,” the Sensei answered. “First, you’ve almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defence for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.”\n\nThe boy’s greatest weakness had become his greatest strength."

      "body": "The Adventures Of Little Drop:\n\nLittle Drop lives in the great big ocean with Daddy Drop, Mommy Drop, and Little Sister Drop. He loves to splash and lay all day long.\n\nOne day, Little Drop and his family went playing near the surface of the ocean to visit his Uncle Sleet, Aunt Hail and his cousins, Frosty and Snowflake. Little Drop loves to play with his cousins. The sun made him feel warm and energetic. All of a sudden, Little Drop started to rise out of the ocean! He looked around and saw Daddy Drop, Mommy Drop, and little Sister Drop start to rise, too. Even his Uncle Sleet and Aunt Hail, along with his cousins were rising up higher and higher.\n\n“What’s going on, Daddy Drop?” Little Drop asked as the whole family continued to rise up, up, up into the sky. “We are evaporating, Little Drop! It’s okay! This is all part of the Great Water Cycle,” reassured Daddy Drop. Once they were miles up in the sky, Little Drop and his family joined millions of other Drops just like him to make a Cloud.\n\nThen, the mighty Wind started to blow. He blew Little Drop and the rest of the cloud thousands of miles away. “Will I ever see my beloved ocean again?” thought Little Drop. Soon, Little Drop could see land far below him. He could see houses and rivers, farms and cities, cars and lots of trees.\n\nAs the Cloud got closer to the mountains, Uncle Sleet said, “You folks will probably fall here, but Aunt Hail and the kids and I are going to go a bit farther North. We’ll see you all in a couple weeks!” “Bye!” said cousins Frost and Snowflake. “Bye,”  said Little Drop and Little Sister Drop. “Wait a minute, Daddy Drop,” said Little Drop. “Did Uncle Sleet just say ‘fall’?” “Yes, Little Drop. But it won’t hurt. Remember, this is all part of the Great Water Cycle. We are about to become the part of Rain! This is how we’ll get back to the ocean.” replied Daddy Drop. \n\nLittle Drop started to shiver. Little Sister Drop started to shiver, too. “I’m cold!” she said. “When we get cold, the sky can’t hold us any longer and we get to fall as rain,” said Daddy Drop. Then, it happened and they fell out of the sky. They were now Rain!\n\nLittle Drop plopped onto the leaf of an oak tree, slid to the edge and fell some more. He fell into a puddle under a tree. Little Sister Drop fell right beside him. “Where’s Daddy and Mommy Drop?” Little Sister Drop asked. “I don’t know, Little Sister Drop. Let’s swim to that creek and find them,” said Little Drop. They held hands and swam from the puddle into the creek. The creek was babbling along quite happily down the hill. It made Little Drop and Little Sister Drop smile. They babbled right along with the creek.\n\nAs they made their way through the hillside, they saw all kinds of creatures, deer, squirrels, beavers. It wasn’t long until their little creek joined a river. There were lots and lots of other drops in the river, but none of them were Daddy and Mommy Drop. As they went down the river, they saw houses and people fishing. There were even some small boats.\n\nAll of a sudden, Little Drop and Little Sister Drop were sucked into an opening on the side of the river! It was a pipe that led to a water pump. Around and around they swirled in the pump until they were thrust at super high speed through another long pipe.\n\nLittle Drop and Little Sister Drop fell out of a kitchen faucet and into a sink full of dirty dishes. “Weeeee!” yelled Little Drop as they played up and down the dishes. Little Sister Drop enjoyed it just as much as Little Drop did. After all the dishes were cleaned, the plug was pulled from the sink and a whirlpool formed in the sink. Round and round and round went Little Drop and Little Sister Drop. They slid down the drain and down through more and more pipes. It was the longest water slide in the world! Finally, they came out of the pipe and were dumped back into the river. There were docks for the boats and more people fishing.\n\nAfter a couple of more days, they drifted past a very tall lighthouse standing watch over the entrance to a harbor. Little Drop and Little Sister Drop were back in the big ocean! A wave splashed nearby. It was Daddy Drop! There was Mommy Drop, too!Little Drop was so happy to see his parents again. They looked at them and there were Uncle Sleet, Aunt Hail, and his cousins, Frost and Snowflake. They were all together again in the big ocean.\n\n“I was afraid I would never see you again,” Little Drop told Daddy Drop. “Oh, Little Drop, don’t even be afraid,” reassured Daddy Drop. “It is just part of the Great Water Cycle. Water always comes back to the ocean. Whenever we go through the Great Water Cycle, we always come back here. If we get separated, sooner or later, we’ll see each other again.”\n\nFrom that day on, Little Drop looked forward to the sun warming him up and sending him high into the sky. He was always excited to be part of the Great Water Cycle. Little Drop had many, many more adventures in the Great Water Cycle!"

      "body": "The Happy Prince:\n\nHigh above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  “He is as beautiful as a weathercock,” remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; “only not quite so useful,” he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.  “The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.”\n\n“I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.\n\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have never seen one.”\n\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows; “she has no money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love.  “She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I admit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.”\n\n“Will you come away with me?” he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n“You have been trifling with me,” he cried.  “I am off to the Pyramids.  Good-bye!” and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  “Where shall I put up?” he said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.”  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.\n\n“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.”\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?” he said; “I must look for a good chimney-pot,” and he determined to fly away.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n“Who are you?” he said.\n\n“I am the Happy Prince.”\n\n“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow; “you have quite drenched me.”\n\n“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.”\n\n“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow to himself.  He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a little street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there himself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.”\n\n“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons, who were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.  “It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.”\n\n“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  “How wonderful the stars are,” he said to her, “and how wonderful is the power of love!”\n\n“I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,” she answered; “I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.”\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he came to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble.  Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and he sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done.  “It is curious,” he remarked, “but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.”\n\n“That is because you have done a good action,” said the Prince.  And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always made him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a remarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.\n\n“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed himself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  “Have you any commissions for Egypt?” he cried; “I am just starting.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?”\n\n“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the city I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”\n\n“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, who really had a good heart.  “Shall I take him another ruby?”\n\n“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I have left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him.  He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.”\n\n“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do that”; and he began to weep.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.”\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the student’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.\n\n“I am beginning to be appreciated,” he cried; “this is from some great admirer.  Now I can finish my play,” and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am going to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n“I am come to bid you good-bye,” he cried.\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will you not stay with me one night longer?”\n\n“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be here.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.”\n\n“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little match-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.”\n\n“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the Swallow, “but I cannot pluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.”\n\n“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.”\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and darted down with it.  He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.  “What a lovely bit of glass,” cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince.  “You are blind now,” he said, “so I will stay with you always.”\n\n“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you must go away to Egypt.”\n\n“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince’s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.\n\n“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.”\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.”\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.  “We have bread now!” they cried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more.  “Good-bye, dear Prince!” he murmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?”\n\n“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.”\n\n“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the Swallow.  “I am going to the House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?”\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.  It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!” he said.\n\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,” said the Mayor in fact, “he is litttle beter than a beggar!”\n\n“Little better than a beggar,” said the Town Councillors.\n\n“And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!” continued the Mayor.  “We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.”  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  “As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,” said the Art Professor at the University.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  “We must have another statue, of course,” he said, “and it shall be a statue of myself.”\n\n“Of myself,” said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.  When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.\n\n“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.  “This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it away.”  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.\n\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.\n\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.”"

However, my very passion is helping others in anything well basically most in health problems. \n\nFor example, one day that I was in 5th grade sitting in my classroom doing some work that the teacher told us to do quietly , and my teacher got a call from the from office that someone came to pick me up. So she took the call and said “ So America you're leaving early today and have a good afternoon”. But I didn’t know that someone was going to pick me up early because, my mom didn’t tell me nothing when she drop me off in the morning. So I left school and my aunt didn’t tell me nothing she just drove and drove without saying any word to me or why she picked me up instead of my mom?\n\n Furthermore, I was just wondering where we were heading towards but I didn’t get any information until, I told my aunt “ Why did you pick me up and not my mom? And where are we going because, my mom didn’t tell me nothing that you were going to pick me up or take me somewhere.” She end up telling me what had happened and why she picked me up and she said “ Well I got a call from your mom to pick you up early because, something had happen to your aunt your mom’s sister that she was at the hospital very ill because of the “Lung Cancer” she had in her . As I was hearing that about my aunt I was feeling something in my heart and inside my body I didn’t know what I was feeling but it was something. \n\nHowever, we finally got to the Baylor Hospital and asked for my aunt where was she and how she was doing. They told us that she was very ill because and they couldn't infer if she was going to save herself or just not survived. I called my mom to see where she was with the rest of the family so I could go with her and I did. But when I saw my family they were all crying and crying because, the doctor had said to them that she didn’t have any faith or chance of getting saved. \n\nAfter, the doctor said that about her I went to her room where she was and I spoke to her. She was telling that she just didn’t have any strength or hope to be fighting against the cancer. But I kept telling her that I needed her and not just me but all of her family did too and all her advice and all her spirit she had. I gave her like a huge long speech but after what I had told her she didn’t give up and she kept fighting over that ugly Lung Cancer. By the end of the 2 years passed the doctor told her she was FREE FROM THE CANCER!!!!! After she got that news we were all happy to see her back and being back with her family that missed her so much.That’s why I want to help people and others that think they cant fight over there ill."

      "body": "The Reluctant Dragon:\n\nOne evening, long ago, a shepherd ran home, terrified. “I saw something terrible,” he cried to his wife and son. “It’s as big as four horses. It has long, sharp claws, a long pointy tail, and shiny blue scales all over its body.” His son looked up from his book. “That sounds like a dragon,” he said. His parents got scared but the boy wasn’t scared.\n\nThe next day, he set off up the hill to find the dragon. “He might be friendly,” thought the boy. The dragon was friendly and he was thrilled to see the boy. The boy smiled and sat down and asked the dragon all kinds of questions.\n\nThe dragon told stories of long, long ago. “There were dangerous dragons everywhere. And brave knights fought them to rescue Princesses,” he said to the little boy. The boy came back every day to hear the stories.\n\nBut then, the villagers found out about the dragon. They were terrified. The boy ran straight to the dragon and said, “The villagers want to get rid of you!” “But I would not hurt even a fly,” said the dragon. That afternoon, the boy heard even worse news. Saint George, the dragon killer was there to fight the dragon. Immediately, the boy rushed back to the dragon.\n\n“Saint George, the dragon killer wants to fight you,” gasped the boy. “And he has the longest spear I’ve ever seen.” “But I don’t like fighting. I’ll just hide in my cave until he goes away,” said the dragon. “You can’t! Everyone wants a fight!” cried the boy. The dragon yawned. “I’m sure you’ll think of something,” he said.\n\nThe boy walked slowly back down to his village. A crowd of villagers was telling about the dangerous dragon. “He eats ten sheep for breakfast! He burned down five houses,” roared the villagers. “It’s not true!” said the boy. “The dragon wouldn’t hurt a fly!” “But everyone wants a fight,” said George. “What can I do?” “Follow me!” said the boy and he took George to meet the dragon.\n\n“What a perfect place for a fight,” said George. “No fighting!” said the dragon, firmly. “Not even pretend to fight?” asked the boy. “Maybe…” said the dragon. The boy turned to George, “Do you promise not to hurt him?” “Well, it has to look real,” said George. “Will there be feast afterward?” asked the dragon. “There will, and you can come,” promised George.\n\nThe following day, lots of villagers arrived to watch the fight. The boy waited nervously by the dragon’s cave. They cheered and waved when Saint George rode into view. Soon, a roar echoed through the hills. Flames filled the air. Everyone gasped as the dragon appeared. His scales sparkled and he breathed out fire. “Charge!” cried George. He galloped hard, his spear held high. The dragon bounded up and they shot past each other. “Missed,” yelled the crowd.\n\nGeorge and the dragon turned around and charged again. This time, there was no way they could miss. Finally, after a lot of fight, the dragon slumped to the ground. George towered over him. “Cut off his head,” shouted the crowd. “I think the dragon has learned his lesson,” George declared. “Let’s invite him to our feast!”\n\nAnd he led the villagers, the boy, and the dragon back down the hill. The boy was happy because his plan worked. The villagers were happy because they’d seen a fight. George was happy because he’d won. But the dragon was happiest of all. He had lots of new friends and a full tummy. “Jolly night it’s been,” he murmured and began to snore. “How will I get him home?” said the boy. “I’ll help,” said George. He gave the dragon a prod and they set off up the hill arm-in-arm – the saint, the dragon, and the boy."

      "body": "A String Of Pearls:\n\nThe railroad in Denmark still extends only from Copenhagen to Korsör; it is a string of pearls. Europe has a wealth of these pearls; its most costly are named Paris, London, Vienna, Naples. And yet many a man will point out as his favorite pearl not one of these great cities but rather some little country town that is still the home of homes to him, the home of those dearest to him. Yes, often it is not a town at all, but a single homestead, a little house, hidden among green hedges, a place hardly visible as the train speeds by.\n\nHow many pearls are there on the line from Copenhagen to Korsör? We will consider just six, which most people must notice; old memories and poetry itself give a luster to these pearls, so that they shine in our thoughts.\n\nNear the hill where stands the palace of Frederick VI, the home of Oehlenschläger's childhood, one of these pearls glistens, sheltered by Söndermarken's woody ground. It used to be called \"The Cottage of Philemon and Baucis.\" Here lived Rahbek and his wife, Camma; here, under their hospitable roof, assembled many of the generation's finest intellects from busy Copenhagen; it was the festival home of the intellectual. Now, don't say, \"Ah, what a change!\" No, it is still the home of the intellect, a conservatory for sick plants, for buds which do not have the strength to unfold their true beauty of color and form or show the blossoming and fruit-bearing which is hidden within them. The insane asylum, surrounded by human love, is truly a spot of holiness, a hospital for the sick plants that shall someday be transplanted to bloom in the paradise of God. The weakest minds are assembled now here, where once the strongest and keenest met to exchange thoughts and ideas, but still the flame of generosity mounts heavenward from \"The Cottage of Philemon and Baucis.\"\n\nAncient Roskilde, the burial town of Kings, by Hroar's Spring, now lies before us. The slender towers of the church lift up above the low town and mirror themselves in Issefiord. Only one grave shall we seek here; it is not that of the mighty Queen Margrethe; no within the white-walled churchyard which we speed close by is the grave, and over it lays a small, plain stone. The master of the organ, the reviver of the old Danish romances, rests here. We recall, \"The clear waves rolled\" and \"There dwelt a king in Leire.\" Roskilde, burial place of kings-in your pearl we see the insignificant gravestone whereon is cut a lyre and the name Weyse.\n\nNow we reach Sigersted, near the town of Ringsted. The bed of the river is low here; yellow corn waves over the spot where Hagbarth's boat lay at anchor, not far from Signe's maiden bower. Who does not know the legend of Hagbarth, who was hanged on the oak tree while the bower of Signe burst into flames? Who can forget that legend of immortal love?\n\n\"Beautiful Sorö, encircled by woods!\" Your quiet old cloistered town peeps out through its mossy trees; the keen eyes of youth from the academy can look across the lake toward the world's highway and hear the roar of the locomotive's dragon as it speeds through the woods. Sorö, pearl of poetry, you are guarding the dust of Holberg! Your palace of learning stands beside the deep woodland lake like a great white swan, and near by, like the bright starflower of the woods, there gleams a tiny cottage, whence pious hymns echo throughout the land; words are spoken within, and the peasant listens and learns of Denmark's bygone days. As the song of the bird is to the greenwood, so is Ingemann to Sorö.\n\nOn to the town of Slagelse! What is mirrored here in this pearl's luster? Gone forever is the cloister of Antoorskov (NB: Antvorskov); vanished are the rich halls of the castle, even the last remaining wing; yet one relic of olden times still lingers here, the wooden cross on the hill. It has been repaired again and again, for it marks the spot where, legend tells us, Saint Anders, holy priest of Slagelse, awoke, after having been brought there from Jerusalem in a single night.\n\nKorsör, birthplace of Baggesen, master of words and wit! The ruined old ramparts of the fallen fortress are now the last visible witness of your childhood home; their lengthening sunset shadows point to the spot where stood the house in which you were born. From these hills you looked toward Sprogö and sang in undying verse.\n\nNowhere have roses so red a hue\nAnd nowhere are feathers so light and so blue,\nNowhere the thorns so daintily grown,\nAs those to childhood innocence known.\nHumorous, charming singer! We shall weave for thee a garland of woodbine and fling it into the lake, so that the current may bear it to the coast of Kielerfiord, where your ashes rest. The tide shall bring you a greeting from the new generation, a greeting from your birthplace Korsör - where I drop my string of pearls.\n\n\"That's quite right! A string of pearls does stretch from Copenhagen to Korsör,\" said Grandmother when she had heard this read aloud. \"It's a string of pearls for me now, as it was more than forty years ago. We had no railroad then; we spent days on a trip that can now be made in as many hours. That was in 1815, and I was twenty-one; that is a charming age! Although to be up in the sixties, that is also a wonderful age! In my young days it was a much rarer event than it is now to come to Copenhagen, which we considered the town of all towns! My parents hadn't visited it for twenty years, but at last they were going, and I was going with them. We had talked about that journey for years before, and now it was actually coming true; it seemed as though a new life were beginning for me, and really in a way a new life did begin for me.\n\n\"There was such a bustle of sewing and packing; and when at last we were ready to start, such a crowd of friends came to bid us farewell! It was a long journey we had ahead of us. Shortly before noon we drove out of Odense in my parents' Holstein carriage, and our friends waved to us from the windows all the way down the street, till we passed through St. Jörgen's Gate. The weather was beautiful; the birds sang, and everything was joyful; we forgot what a long and tiresome road it was to Nyborg. We reached it toward evening; but the little sailing vessel had to wait for the mail, which didn't arrive until night. Then we got on board, and as far as we could see the wide, smooth waters lay before us. We lay down and went to sleep in our clothes. When I awoke and came on deck next morning, I could see nothing at all; a heavy fog covered everything. When I heard the cocks crowing, I knew it must be sunrise; bells were ringing, but I didn't know where; then the mist lifted, and we found we were still lying very close to Nyborg. Later in the day a wind came up, but it was against us; we tacked back and forth, and at last were lucky enough to reach Korsör by a little past eleven that night, having spent twenty-two hours to go sixteen miles!\n\nIt was good to get ashore, but it was dark; the lamps were weak, and it all seemed very strange to me, who had never been in any other town but Odense.\n\n\" 'Look!' said my father. 'Baggesen was born there! And Birckner lived in that house!' When I heard that, somehow the dark old town with its narrow little streets seemed to grow larger and brighter. And we were so glad to feel solid earth under our feet! There was no sleep for me that night, for I was so excited over all that I had seen and heard since I had left home the day before.\n\n\"Next morning we had to leave early; there was a terrible road ahead of us, with great bumps and holes as far as Slagelse, and not much better from there on, and we wanted to get to the Crab Inn early, so that on the same day we could reach Sorö and visit the Möllers' Emil, as we called him then; yes, he was your grandfather, my late husband, the dean. He was a student at Sorö then, and had just passed his second examination.\n\n\"That afternoon we reached the Crab Inn, which was a gallant place at that time, the very best inn on the whole trip, with the prettiest country around it. Yes, but you must all admit that it still is. Madame Plambek was an industrious hostess, and everything in her house was as smoothly scoured as a larding board. On the wall they had, framed under glass, Baggesen's letter to her; it was indeed worth seeing, and I greatly enjoyed looking at it. Then he went to Sorö and found Emil there. You can imagine how glad we were to see him, and he to see us. He was so thoughtful and charming; he took us to see the church, and the graves of Absalon and Holberg; he inspected the old monkish inscriptions with us, and sailed with us across the lake to Parnasset. It was the most wonderful evening I remember! I was thinking that to become a poet one had only to come to Sorö and meditate among those lovely, peaceful scenes. By moonlight we followed the 'Philosopher's Walk,' as it's called, the wonderful and lonely little path beside the lake that joins the highway near the Crab Inn. Emil stayed for supper with us, and my father and my mother declared he had grown so sensible and looked so well. It was almost Whitsuntide, and he promised that in a few days he would be in Copenhagen to join us and his family. Ah, those few hours in Sorö and at the Crab Inn I count among the choicest pearls of my life!\n\n\"Next morning we again started very early, for we had a long trip to Roskilde, where we wanted to see the church and Father wanted to visit an old school friend that evening. We spent that night in Roskilde and reached Copenhagen by noon the next day. So we had spent about three days on a journey that can now be made in three hours-Korsör to Copenhagen. The pearls on that way have not grown more costly-that could never be-but the string is new and wonderful.\n\n\"I stayed with my parents in Copenhagen for three weeks. Emil was with us for eighteen whole days, and when we returned to Fünen he went with us as far as Korsör. There, before we parted, we were betrothed. So it is no wonder I should call the road from Copenhagen to Korsör a string of pearls.\n\n\"Afterwards, when Emil received his post at Assens, we were married. We often talked about that journey to Copenhagen, and intended doing it again, but then your mother came along, and after her came her brothers and sisters, and with all of them there was so much to do and take care of! Then your grandfather was promoted and made a dean; yes, everything was happiness and joy, but we never got to Copenhagen again. No, I have never been there since, though we often thought and talked about it. Now I'm much too old to travel by rail, but still I'm right glad there is a railway; it's a real blessing, because it brings you young ones to me more quickly!\n\n\"Nowadays Odense is hardly farther from Copenhagen than in my youth it was from Nyborg; you can speed to Italy in the time it took us to reach Copenhagen! Yes, that is certainly something! It doesn't matter that I just sit here always; let the others travel, so long as they sometimes travel to me.\n\n\"And you needn't laugh at me, you young people, for sitting so still here, day after day! I have really a wonderful journey ahead of me; I shall soon have to travel at a speed far greater than the railway's. For when our Lord calls me I shall go to join your grandfather; and when you have completed your work on this dear earth, you too will join us; and then, if we talk over the days of our mortal life, believe me, dear children, I shall say then as I do now, 'From Copenhagen to Korsör is a perfect string of pearls!' \""

      "body": "The Math Dunce:\n\nThat year, in the local school, there was a new Math teacher, as well as some new pupils.\nOne of the new kids was the stupidest child anyone had ever seen. It made no difference\nhow quickly or how slowly they tried explaining numbers to him; he would always end up\nsaying something enormously dumb. Like two plus two was five, seven times three was\ntwenty-seven, or a triangle had thirty corners...\n\nBefore this boy arrived, Maths lessons had been the most boring of all. Now they were great\nfun. Encouraged by the new teacher, the children would listen to the pieces of nonsense\nspouted by the new kid, and they would have to correct his mistakes.\n\nThey all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then think up the most original ways\nto explain them. To do this they used all kinds of stuff: sweets, playing cards, oranges, paper\nplanes...\n\nIt didn't seem like any of this bothered the new kid.\n\nHowever, little Lewis was sure that it was bound to make him feel sad inside.\n\nSo, one day, he decided to follow the new kid home after school; Lewis was sure he would\nsee him crying.\n\nOn leaving school, the new kid walked a few minutes to a local park, and there he waited for\na while, until someone came along to meet him...\n\nIt was the new teacher!\n\nThe teacher gave the new kid a hug, and off they went, hand in hand. Following from a\ndistance, Lewis could hear they were talking about Math.\n\nAnd that stupid new kid knew everything about it, much more than anyone in the class!"

      "body": "Friend-ship:\n\nIn the first day of third quarter, I was so scared to go into class for assigned seats and new people. A girl named Sayge was sitting close to my assigned seat. I thought she was a boxer and I kept wondering if she was going to punch me or not. If I knew, then I would’ve told the teacher to change my seat. \n\nWhen I saw shoes and a basketball, I was thinking that maybe she was a basketball player. After the end of class, I walked to the door and Sayge was there. “Hi.” She whispered. I figured that maybe she wasn’t so bad. I felt bad because I thought she was a mean girl with an angry attitude.\n\n When five English classes passed by, I started to get to know her and Sayge was really funny all the time. It was the best day, I would never forget. Sayge is a good company but mostly a good friend. Sometimes I get sad because Sayge isn’t here to make my day but there are more friends to cheer me up. \n\nOne day in English class, I saw Sayge look sad like a loner in the corner, but I didn’t want to tell her if she’s ok. If I told her then she would’ve blamed me for something I didn’t do. I asked her and she told me that the basketball season was over for the quarter. \n\nI didn’t know what to do because I am not good with people getting upset, mad, or sad. I am not good with people asking me for advice that I’m not interested in. Finally I tried to make her happy. “Oh, then are you going to play next year?” I told her. Sayge answered yes and that was all I could do to cheer her up. I was going to tell her something but the bell rang and I didn’t have time to tell her what I was going to say. Next time I will but not now.\n\n After the basketball season was over, I felt something inside of me that maybe Sayge might not come today. Finally the bell rang and I was sad. After the bell rang, she came in and I was so relieved. If Sayge was my best friend, then I would always be by her side and give her a friendship bracelet. One day in high school, I will join Sayge in her basketball team with her other friends too. If it works, then I will be so happy. I consider Sayge as my hero because Sayge always makes me smile and she makes me laugh. Sayge is the only person that could put me in a world of happiness."

      "body": "Hurricane Hilda Frolics With Fairies:\n\nHurricane Hilda’s tooth was getting wigglier and wigglier.  She had been crunching on raw carrots, munching on juicy apples and lunching on crusty bread for over a week, trying to make that tooth fall out!  Hurricane Hilda was looking forward to putting her tooth under her pillow in a special silver box and having her first visit from The Tooth Fairy…\n\nNow it was Hurricane Hilda’s first day at real school, and she was so busy learning her way around and making friends in Miss Scott’s class, that she almost forgot about her wobbly tooth.  Until snack time, that is, when she ate a spoonful of soft apricot yoghurt… and found something small and hard in it!  Hurricane Hilda’s tooth was out at last and she hurried to tell her teacher the exciting news.\n\nMiss Scott wrapped the tooth in a piece of white tissue paper and said she would keep it safe on her desk until it was time for Hurricane Hilda to take it home.  But when the home bell rang, Miss Scott could not find the tissue paper or the tooth anywhere.  Hurricane Hilda helped look all over Miss Scott’s desk, in the drawers, and even in the wastepaper bin, but there was no sign of Hurricane Hilda’s tooth.  Miss Scott said she was very sorry.  On the way home, Hurricane Hilda explained to Mummy that her tooth had fallen out and gone missing somewhere in the classroom.\n\nThat night Hurricane Hilda was very sad that she had no tooth to put in the silver box for The Tooth Fairy to collect from under her pillow and exchange for some coins.  Mummy told Hurricane Hilda not to worry, as they would take extra good care of the next tooth that fell out.  So Hurricane Hilda snuggled down to sleep and dreamed of The Tooth Fairy.\n\nWhen she woke the next morning, Hurricane Hilda was surprised to find under her pillow a pearly white envelope with her name on the front in sparkly silver handwriting.  When she opened it, a handful of silver coins fell out onto the bed.  Also in the envelope was a piece of notepaper with more magical silver writing, which made Hurricane Hilda tingle with happiness!\n\nDear Hurricane Hilda,\n\nTell your teacher I took your tooth,\nAnd fluttered in the sky,\nHere are some pennies for your purse,\nI’ll be back by and by!\n\nLove from\nPearl - Your Tooth Fairy\nTHE TIDY FAIRIES GO ON STRIKE\n\nHurricane Hilda knew all about the Tidy Fairies.  Mummy had explained that every night after Hurricane Hilda had gone to bed, the Tidy Fairies would magically clean and tidy the whole house...\n\nWanda the Washing-up Fairy would do the dishes.  Tilda the Toilet Roll Fairy would replace empty loo rolls and clean the bathroom.  About once a week Dora the Dusting Fairy would whiz round with her feather duster and cloths chasing away cobwebs and polishing tables, windows and mirrors.\n\nAnd before Hurricane Hilda woke each morning, Brenda the Bed-making Fairy would fix Mummy’s bed, Linda the Laundry Fairy would put all the dirty washing in the machine, and Glenda the Gardening Fairy would open the patio doors and wake up all the flowers.  Sometimes, Hurricane Hilda woke up just as Vera the Vacuuming Fairy vanished from downstairs…\n\nOne day, Hurricane Hilda was surprised to find that the Tidy Fairies had not been to visit, and the house was in quite a mess!  Hurricane Hilda’s Mummy was in bed sick with the ‘flu and she explained that the Tidy Fairies had gone on strike because they needed extra help.  Hurricane Hilda had always wanted to be a fairy, and this was her big chance!\n\nHurricane Hilda dashed off to put on her fairy costume and wings, and began waving her magic wand.  First she fluttered into the kitchen to pour a glass of orange juice and butter a pancake for Mummy’s breakfast.  Then she flitted all around the house, proudly doing the jobs of the Tidy Fairies all by herself.\n\nThe next day Hurricane Hilda was excited to wake up to the sound of Vera the Vacuuming Fairy!  Hurricane Hilda rushed downstairs to find Mummy dressed and smiling, cooking scrambled eggs on toast in the kitchen.  Mummy gave Hurricane Hilda a big hug and pointed to a pink envelope on the table, addressed to Hurricane Hilda in glittering gold handwriting.  The golden words on the letter inside made Hurricane Hilda feel like she was floating on air, just like a real fairy!\n\nDear Hurricane Hilda,\n\nWe’re sorry that we left a mess,\nAnd if we caused you any stress,\nThank you for doing Mummy proud,\n“Hilda the Helper Fairy” joins our crowd!\n\nLove from\nWanda, Tilda, Dora, Brenda, Linda, Glenda & Vera\nThe Tidy Fairies\nHurricane Hilda watched through the window in wonder as snowflakes sifted silently from the sky and settled on the sparkling snowscape.  She felt very Christmassy as she returned to the glowing hearth inside and to her job of decorating the tree.  The spruce was already bedecked with shiny tinsel, glittering baubles, twinkling fairy lights and a host of handmade decorations.\n\nAt last Hurricane Hilda reached for Mary, the Christmas Fairy, whom Mummy had placed on top of the tree ever since she herself was a little girl.  Mary had given joy to many children over the years, as she listened to them singing carols and watched them opening gifts.\n\nUnfortunately Mary had been packed away and unpacked so many times that she had lost all her sparkle: her golden dress was ragged, her silvery wings were droopy, her wand was bent, and all that remained of her flowing golden hair were a few strands at the back.  “Yikes!  Scary Mary!” laughed Hurricane Hilda, as she handed the fairy to Mummy to finish the top of the tree.\n\nHurricane Hilda hugged Mummy and they sang “Oh! Christmas Tree” together, as they did every year, while they made their special Christmas wishes.  Hurricane Hilda wished for a real fairy, and Mummy wished for magic on Christmas Day.\n\nHurricane Hilda spent the last few days building a snowman, wrapping presents, and helping to make a Christmas pudding.  At last it was Christmas Eve and, after hanging her stocking by the fire, Hurricane Hilda was sure she heard the sound of sleigh bells as she drifted off to sleep…\n\nAs soon as her eyes popped open on Christmas morning, Hurricane Hilda dashed downstairs. She gasped excitedly at her stocking bulging with goodies, and gazed in awe at the mosaic of shimmering paper and bows containing surprises under the tree.\n\nBut what was this?  A glimmering Christmas card sat in the middle of the room attached to a golden ribbon.  Hurricane Hilda’s eyes followed the ribbon across the room up to the top of the tree where it was tied to Scary Mary’s magic wand.  But to Hurricane Hilda’s amazement, the fairy no longer looked like Scary Mary!  The pretty face was unmistakeably Mary, but her dress and wings were now glistening with gold and silver sequins, her wand was straight and glittering, and most gorgeous of all was a bejewelled crown holding in place a mane of thick golden hair!\n\n“Our Christmas wishes came true!” exclaimed Hurricane Hilda, as she read the card attached to the golden ribbon:\n\nDear Hurricane Hilda,\n\nI was getting bald and tatty,\nLooking rather scary,\nBut thanks to your magical Christmas wishes,\nI’m beautiful… and hairy!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nLove from\nHairy Mary - The Christmas Fairy"

      "body": "The Rose And The Amaranth:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a garden two plants were planted next to each other.\n\nOne was a rose plant whereas the other an Amaranth plant. These plants grew next to each other. Both of them admired the other. The rose plant thought the Amarnath plant was better than it, with prettier flowers. And the Amarnath plant felt that the rose plant was better than it.\n\nOne day, the Rose plant and the Amaranth plant had a conversation. The Amaranth plant said, “I admire your plant. The flowers of your plant bloom lustrously. You even smell nice. Above all, you truly are beautiful,” the Amarnath plant said. “I can see why you are the universal favorite. I envy your beauty and your scent.”\n\nThe Rose plant, though flattered, did not say much. Aware of its beauty, it also knew that its beauty came with a price. “Dear Amaranth plant,” the Rose plant said. “I thank you for praising me. But, I feel otherwise. Although my flowers are beautiful and sweet smelling, my beauty isn’t long lasting.”\n\n“My beauty lasts only until I am young. Whereas, your beauty is everlasting. My petals wither and fall off. These flowers won’t bloom forever. And when my flowers are plucked out, they too wither off soon. The season suitable for me also lasts but a short time.”\n\n“However, your flowers do not wither as soon as mine. Your flowers are always blooming, even after they are snipped off. Amaranth, the flowers you produce stay young for ever. Unlike mine. And that is why my beauty does not mean much. You are immortal, while I die sooner or later.”\n\nThe poor Rose plant had a hint of sadness in its voice. After this conversation, the Amaranth plant realized that it had been wrong about the Rose plant. And found beauty in itself."
