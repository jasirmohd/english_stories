      "title": "17 Camels and 3 Sons",
      "body": "Long ago, there lived an old man with his three sons in a deserted village, located in the vicinity of a desert. He had 17 camels, and they were the main source of his income. He used to rent out camels as a means of shipping in the desert. One day, he passed away. He had left a will, leaving his assets for his three sons.\n\nAfter the funeral and the other obligations were over, the three sons read the will. While their father had divided all the property he had into three equal parts, he had divided the 17 camels in a different way. They were not shared equally among the three as 17 is an odd number and a prime number, which cannot be divided.\n\nThe old man had stated that the eldest son will own half of the 17 camels, the middle one will get one third of the 17 camels, and the youngest one will get his share of camels as one ninth!\n\nAll of them were stunned to read the will and questioned each other how to divide the 17 camels as mentioned in the will. It is not possible to divide 17 camels and give half of the 17 camels to the eldest one. It is not possible also to divide the camels for the other two sons.\n\nThey spent several days thinking of ways to divide the camels as mentioned in the will, but none could find the answer.\n\nThey finally took the issue to the wise man in their village. The wise man heard the problem and instantly found a solution. He asked them to bring all the 17 camels to him.\n\nThe sons brought the camels to the wise man's place. The wise man added a camel owned by him and made the total number of camels 18.\n\nNow, he asked the first son to read the will. As per the will, the eldest son got half the camels, which now counted to 18 / 2 = 9 camels! The eldest one got 9 camels as his share.\n\nThe remaining camels were 9.\n\nThe wise man asked the second son to read the will. He was assigned 1 / 3 of the total camels.\n\nIt came to 18 / 3 = 6 camels. The second son got 6 camels as his share.\n\nTotal number of camels shared by the elder sons - 9 + 6 = 15 camels.\n\nThe third son read out his share of camels: 1 / 9th of the total number of camels - 18 / 9 = 2 camels.\n\nThe youngest one got 2 camels as his share.\n\nTotally there were 9 + 6 + 2 camels shared by the brothers, which counted to 17 camels.\n\nNow, the one camel added by the wise man was taken back.\n\nThe wise man solved this problem smartly with his intelligence.\n\nIntelligence is nothing but finding a common ground to solve an issue. In short, every problem has a solution."

      "body": "One beautiful spring morning, a merchant loaded his donkey with bags of salt to go to the market, in order to sell the salt. The merchant and his donkey were walking along together. They had not walked far when they reached a river on the way.\n\nUnfortunately, the donkey slipped and fell into the river. As it scrambled up the bank of the river, it noticed that the bags of salt loaded on his back had become lighter.\n\nThere was nothing the merchant could do except return home, where he loaded his donkey with more bags of salt. As they reached the slippery riverbank again, the donkey fell into the river, this time deliberately. Thus the salt was wasted again.\n\nBy now the merchant knew the donkey's trick. He wanted to teach the animal a lesson. As he returned home the second time with the donkey, the merchant loaded bags of sponges on its back.\n\nThe duo set out on their trip to the market a third time. On reaching the river, the donkey very cleverly fell into the water again. But now, instead of the load becoming lighter, it became heavier.\n\nThe merchant laughed at the donkey and said, \"You foolish donkey, your trick has been discovered. You should know that you cannot fool anyone too many times.\""

      "body": "Long ago, people lived happily under the rule of a king. The people of the kingdom were very happy as they led a very prosperous life with an abundance of wealth and no misfortunes.\n\nOnce, the king decided to go visiting places of historical importance and pilgrim centres at distant places. He decided to travel by foot to interact with his people. People of distant places were very happy to have a conversation with their king. They were proud that their king had a kind heart.\n\nAfter several weeks of travel, the king returned to the palace. He was quite happy that he had visited many pilgrim centres and witnessed his people leading a prosperous life. However, he had one regret.\n\nHe had intolerable pain in his feet as it was his first trip by foot covering a long distance. He complained to his ministers that the roads weren't comfortable and that they were very stony. He could not tolerate the pain. He said that he was very much worried about the people who had to walk along those roads as it would be painful for them too!\n\nConsidering all this, he ordered his servants to cover the roads in the whole country with leather so that the people of his kingdom can walk comfortably.\n\nThe king's ministers were stunned to hear his order as it would mean that thousands of cows would have to be slaughtered in order to get sufficient quantity of leather. And it would cost a huge amount of money also.\n\nFinally, a wise man from the ministry came to the king and said that he had another idea. The king asked what the alternative was. The minister said, \"Instead of covering the roads with leather, why don't you just have a piece of leather cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet?\"\n\nThe king was very much surprised by his suggestion and applauded the wisdom of the minister. He ordered a pair of leather shoes for himself and requested all his countrymen also to wear shoes.\n\nMoral: Instead of trying to change the world, we should try to change ourselves."

While Sam was generous and selfless, Tom was greedy and selfish!\n\nAs Sam and Tom grew up, their father wanted to share his fortune equally amongst them. However, Tom did not agree and he argued that whoever proved to be more intelligent and strong would have to get a bigger share of the wealth.\n\nSam agreed. Their father decided to organize a competition between the two. He asked the two sons to walk as long as they could, and return home before sunset. The wealth would be divided in proportion to the distance covered. As a rule of the competition, they were not permitted to carry a watch to keep track of the time.\n\nThe following day, Sam and Tom set out to walk. It was a rather sunny day. Sam walked slowly and steadily, while Tom broke into a sprint as he was bent on winning the race and also winning a greater portion of his father's wealth.\n\nSam knew that it would be ideal to walk as far as possible till noon and start for home at noon as it would take the same amount of time to walk back home. Knowing this, Sam decided to turn back for home at noon so as reach home on time.\n\nHowever, Tom, with his greed to earn more wealth, did not attempt to return home even after mid-noon. He walked twice as long as Sam, and thought he would still be able to return home before sunset. He hurried back when he saw the sun turn orange.

      "body": "In the south of Spain, there was a small village whose people were very joyful. The children played under the shades of trees in the gardens of their homes.\n\nA shepherd boy named Nasir stayed near the village with his father, mother and grandmother. Each morning, he took his herd of goats up the hills to find a suitable place for them to graze. In the afternoon he would return with them to the village. Each night his grandmother would tell him a story - the story of stars. This story really interested Nasir.\n\nOn one of those days, as Nasir was watching his herd and playing his flute, he suddenly saw a wonderful light behind a flower bush. When he approached the bush, he saw a transparent and very beautiful crystal ball.\n\nThe crystal ball was glittering like a colorful rainbow. Nasir carefully took it in his hand and turned it around. With surprise, suddenly, he heard a weak voice coming from the crystal ball. It said, \"You can make a wish that your heart desires and I will fulfill it.\"\n\nNasir could not believe that he had actually heard a voice. When he made sure that he had indeed heard that voice from the crystal ball, he was very confused. He had so many wishes that he could not decide upon one particular wish. He said to himself, 'if I wait till tomorrow I will remember many things. Then I will make my wish.'\n\nHe put the crystal ball in a bag and, gathering the herd, happily returned to the village. He decided that he would not tell anyone about the crystal ball.\n\nOn the following day also, Nasir could not decide what to wish for, because he really had everything he needed.\n\nThe days passed as usual, but Nasir was still unable to make his wish. But he appeared to be very cheerful. The people around him were amazed to see the change in his disposition.\n\nOne day, a boy followed Nasir and his herd and hid behind a tree. Nasir, as usual, sat in one corner, took out the crystal ball and for a few moments looked at it. The boy waited for the moment when Nasir would go to sleep. When Nasir did fall asleep after a while, the boy took the crystal ball and ran away.\n\nWhen he arrived at the village, he called all the people and showed them the crystal ball. The citizens of that village took the crystal ball in their hands and turned it around with surprise. Suddenly they heard a voice from inside the crystal ball, which said, \"I can fulfill your wish.\" One person took the ball and screamed, \"I want one bag full of gold.\" Another took the ball and said loudly, \"I want two chests full of jewelry.\" Some of them wished that they would have their own palace with a grand door made from pure gold, instead of their old houses. Some others wished for bags full of jewelry.\n\nAll their wishes were fulfilled, but still the citizens of the village were not happy. They were jealous because the person that had a palace had no gold and the person that had the gold had no palace. For this reason, the citizens of the village were angry with each other and stopped speaking to each other. The gardens in the village where children used to play were no more. There were palaces and gold everywhere. The children became terribly unhappy. Only Nasir and his family were happy and contented. Every morning and afternoon he would play the flute.\n\nOne day the children of the village took the crystal ball to Nasir. The children said to Nasir, \"When we had a small village, we all were happy and joyful.\" The parents also spoke. They said, \"In one way or another, all of us are unhappy. The luxurious palaces and jewelry only bring us pain.\"\n\nWhen Nasir saw that the people were really regretful, he said, \"Even though the crystal ball asked me to wish for something, I have not done it so far. But if you really want everything to return to its own place, then I will wish for it.\"\n\nEveryone happily agreed. Nasir took the crystal ball in his hand, turned it around and wished that the village would become the same as it was before. In a moment, the palaces disappeared, the green gardens appeared, and the same old village full of trees was there.\n\nOnce again the people started to live happily and the children played under the shade of trees. Nasir continued his contented life every day, playing his flute at sunset. Its sweet sound was heard throughout the beautiful green village.\n\nMoral: We should be happy with whatever we have and not be greedy.\n"

      "body": "Once, three cows lived in a green and fresh pasture near a forest: a white cow, a black cow and a reddish-brown cow. The cows were kind to each other. They used to graze in the meadow together and sleep near each other.\n\nOne day, a reddish-brown lion happened to take a stroll out of the forest onto the meadow. It was hungry and looking for a prey. On catching sight of the cows it became glad, but couldn't attack them, because they were together. So, the lion sat behind a boulder and patiently waited till the cows would separate from each other.\n\nHowever, the cows were too clever to separate from each other. They knew that if they were together, no predator could attack them. The lion lay in ambush nearby for two or three days. But the cows continued to remain together, and wouldn't separate from each other. The lion became impatient. It thought of a plan. It went towards the cows, greeted them and said, \"How are you my friends? Are you fine? I have been busy lately, so could not come and visit you. Today I made up my mind to pay you a visit.\"\n\nThe reddish-brown cow said, \"Sir, your coming has really pleased us and brightened our pasture.\"\n\nBoth the white and the black cows were troubled by what their friend, the reddish-brown cow said, and were grieved at its thoughtlessness. They said to each other, \"Why does the reddish-brown cow believe what the lion says?\n\nDoesn't it know that lions seek other animals only to prey on them?\"\n\nAs the days passed by, the reddish-brown cow became more and more attached to the lion. The black cow and the white cow advised it against a friendship with the lion, but their efforts were in vain.\n\nOne day, the lion said to the reddish-brown cow, \"You know that the color of our bodies is dark and that the color of the body of the white cow is light. You also know that light color is the opposite of the dark color. It will be very good if I eat the white cow, so that there will be no difference among us any longer and we will be able to live together well.\"\n\nThe reddish-brown cow accepted the lion's argument and started talking to the black cow to keep it busy, so that the lion could eat the white cow. The white cow was left alone and was killed, while the black and the reddish-brown cows were busy in idle talk.\n\nTwo or three days passed since the lion devoured the white cow. It became hungry again. It called the reddish-brown cow. The cow answered: \"Yes sir!\"\n\nThe lion said, \"The color of my body and the color of your body are both reddish-brown, and black does not go with our color. It will be very good if I eat the black cow, so that in this forest we all will be of the same color.\" The reddish-brown cow accepted this argument and moved away from the black cow.\n\nThe lion attacked and devoured the black cow soon. And as for the reddish-brown cow, it was so filled with joy that it didn't know what to do. It roamed and grazed and said to itself, \"It is only me who has the color of the lion.\"\n\nA few days passed later, the lion was hungry again. It roared and said, \"O the reddish-brown cow! Where are you?\" The reddish-brown cow, shaking with fear, went forward and said, \"Yes sir!\"\n\nThe lion said: \"Today it is your turn. Get yourself ready, I am going to eat you.\"\n\nThe reddish-brown cow, with great fear and horror, said, \"Why sir, I am your friend. I did whatever you asked me to do. Still why do you want to eat me?\"\n\nThe lion roared and said, \"I have no friends. How is it possible that a lion makes friendship with a cow?\"\n\nNo matter how much the reddish-brown cow begged and entreated, the lion didn't accept its words. Finally the cow said, \"Mr. Lion, please allow me to cry out three times before you eat me.\"\n\nThe lion said, \"Ok. Quickly, quickly!\"\n\nThe reddish-brown cow cried out, \"I was eaten the very day the white cow was eaten. I was eaten the very day the black cow was eaten. I was eaten the very day I made friends with the lion.\"\n\nThe lion devoured the reddish-brown cow very quickly. Then it said to itself: \"I have finished my job in this forest. Now I had better go to other forests.\"\n\nAny group without unity will easily be destroyed."

The king became a potato couch and the people started to worry about the king.\n\nOne day, the king realized that he couldn't even move his body, not even his foot. He became very fat and his enemies made fun of him, calling him 'fatty king', 'bulky king' etc.\n\nThe king invited expert doctors from various parts of his country and offered them generous rewards to make him fit. Unfortunately, none could help the king gain his health and fitness. The king spent enormous amounts of money but everything went in vain.\n\nOne fine morning, a holy man visited the country.

Those two falcons were used to different climatic conditions.

The bird trainer let the falcon out of the enclosure. It flew very high, very quickly, and came down to the enclosure within minutes.\n\nThe king was quite surprised, and rewarded the bird trainer with a handful of gold coins. He enquired about the other falcon. The bird trainer stated with regret that the other falcon had not moved even a step from day one and had just sat on the branch. The trainer also added that he had tried everything he could but still failed to make the bird move.\n\nThe king consoled him and told him that he would bring someone more experienced than him to try to train the other falcon.\n\nSoon, the king announced that he needed someone to make the falcon move and fly.\n\nHearing this announcement, an old man reached the King's palace and assured him that he would make the bird fly like the other one.\n\nThe king asked the head trainer to take the old man to the sanctuary to train the falcon.

They began their voyage in a cruise ship, and travelled far and wide. However, in the course of their trip, the weather turned very destructive. The ship was wrecked in the middle of the ocean. Most of the passengers were killed, but Kim and Ray could swim to a nearby island.\n\nThe island was deserted; not even a tree was there. Kim and Ray realized that they could not survive on the island without divine intervention. They decided to pray to God. They wanted to see whose prayer would be more powerful. Kim moved to the eastern tip of the island, knelt down and began to pray there. Ray went to the western tip of the island and prayed there.\n\nKim prayed to God to give him food to survive. Surprisingly, he got a pile of food, fruits and vegetables on the sea shore.\n\nAfter two days, he requested for a beautiful girl as his wife, as he was feeling very lonely on the island. In a few hours, there was a ship wreck near the island and a lone survivor; a beautiful girl. Kim married the girl.\n\nWhatever Kim prayed for, was granted to him.\n\nAlmost a month after the ship wreck, Kim decided to move back to his hometown. He prayed to God to send him a ship to take him home. Sure enough, there came a ship to take Kim and his wife home.\n\nAs the couple was about to enter the ship, Kim heard someone speak to him. It was just a voice. \"Are you going alone, leaving your companion of life here?\"\n\nKim was surprised, \"May I know who is this and whom you are referring to?

He was so weak. It was because Velan did not give him enough food. He had given his father a small earthen plate. Even a small quantity of rice in the plate appeared to be much. Velan was a bad man. He was a drunkard also. After taking drinks, he abused his father badly.\n\nVelan had a son. His name is Muthu. Muthu was just ten years old. He was a very good boy. He loved his grandfather. He had great respect for his grandfather.

The earthen plate fell down. The plate broke into pieces. The food also fell on the floor. Velan was working at the other end of the room. He saw the broken plate. He was very angry with his father and used very harsh words to abuse his father. The old man felt bad about what happened. He was sorry for his mistake. Velan’s words wounded him very deeply.\n\nVelan’s son, Muthu, saw this. He did not like his father. His father was ill-treating his grandfather. He was afraid to speak against his father.

He worked with the tools to make a wooden plate. His father saw him working.\n\n“What are you making, Muthu?\" he asked.\n\n“I am making a wooden plate!\" replied Muthu.\n\n“A wooden plate! What for?\" asked his father.\n\n“I am making it for you, father. When you grow old, like my grandfather, you will need a plate for food. A plate made from earth mat break very easily. Then I may scold you severely. So, I want to give you a wooden plate. It may not break so easily.\"\n\nThe carpenter was shocked to hear this. Only now he realized his mistake. His father was kind to Velan He had looked after Velan very well. Now, he was old. Velan was treating his father severely. Velan was now very sad about his own behavior. He realized his mistakes.

There were bones of dead animals all over the cave. Fortunately, the tiger was not inside the cave at the time.\n\nThe deer was trying to lead her young ones out of the cave. AT that time she heard a loud roar. She saw the tiger at a distance. The tiger was coming towards the cave. It was dangerous to go out of the cave now. She thought of a plan. The tiger had come closer to the cave. The deer raised her voice and shouted, “My deer young children do not weep. I shall capture a tiger for you to eat. You can have a good dinner.\"\n\nThe tiger heard these words. He was disturbed. He said to himself, “Whose is that strange voice from the cave? A dangerous animal is staying inside to capture me. I shall run away to escape death.\"\n\nSo saying, the tiger began to run away from there as fast as possible.\n\nA jackal saw the running tiger. “Why are you running in great fear?\" the jackal asked.

So, I am running away in great fear.\"\n\nThe cunning jackal was now sure. The tiger was a coward. It said to the tiger. “Do not be afraid. No animal is fiercer or stronger than a tiger. Let us go together to find out.\"\n\nBut the tiger said, “I do not want to take a chance. You may run away. I will be left alone to die. So, I will not come with you.\"\n\nThe jackal said, “Trust me. Let us know our tails together. Then I will not be able to leave you.\"\n\nThe tiger agreed unwillingly to this proposal. The jackal tied their tails in a knot. Now they walked towards the cave together.\n\nThe deer saw the jackal and the tiger coming together. She again raised her voice. She shouted towards her children standing inside the cave, “My dear children, I had requested her friend, the clever jackal, to capture a tiger for us. Now look the jackal has captured a tiger for us. He has tied the tiger’s tail to his tail. This is to prevent the tiger from escaping. You will soon have the tiger for our dinner.\"\n\nThe tiger heard this. He was shocked. He was sure now. The jackal cheated him.

In the mad escape the jackal was caught between two rocks. The tiger pulled with all his might. His tail got cut. The jackal was killed in this incident. The tail-less tiger ran away to another part of the forest.\n\nThe deer and her young ones left the tiger’s cave.

What do you want from me?\"\n\nHercules replied, “I am Hercules. Tell me the way to Hesperides.\"\n\nThe old man said, “It is an island. Go along the sea-shore. You will meet a giant. He will show you the way to Hesperides.\"\n\nHercules continued his journey. He met the giant. The giant was very huge and strong. He was sleeping on the shore. Hercules woke him up. The giant was angry. He struck Hercules with a club. Hercules charged at the giant. He lifted the giant and threw him down. But the giant got up immediately. He had become ten times stronger. Hercules threw him down again and again. But each time the giant rose up much stronger. Then Hercules lifted the giant high up in the air. But he did not throw him down. The giant slowly lost all his strength. He now pleaded with Hercules to put him down on the earth. Hercules asked him to tell the way to Hesperides. The giant asked Hercules to meet Atlas. He told him the way to the place where Atlas was.\n\nHercules continued his journey. He, at last, met Atlas.\n\n“Why do you want the golden apples?\" asked Atlas.\n\n“My King has ordered me to get him these three golden apples,\" said Hercules.\n\n“It is a long way from here to that place. Only I can go there. Hold this sky for me. I shall get them for you,\" said Atlas.\n\nHercules agreed. He held the sky on his shoulders. Atlas walked away. He was back in a short time. He put down the three golden apples at the foot of Hercules. Hercules thanked Atlas. He requested Atlas to take back the sky from him.\n\n“Take back the sky!\" said Atlas cunningly. “I have held it for a thousand years. I shall come back after another thousand years!\"\n\nHercules was astonished at what Atlas told him. But he did not express his astonishment. He recovered his senses and replied, “Oh! In that case, will you please hold the sky for a little while? I shall make a pad for my shoulders to support the sky. Then I shall take back the sky from you.\" Thus Hercules talked very quietly.\n\nAtlas agreed. Atlas took back the sky from Hercules. Hercules immediately collected the three golden apples. He bid Atlas goodbye with a mischievous smile on his face. The he walked away towards Greece leaving Atlas speechless and surprised.\n\nHercules reached his homeland Greece after many days of travel. He gave the three golden apples to the King. The King was surprised to have got the golden apples from Hercules. He was happy. But he pretended not to have been satisfied. But he secretly, he was planning to send away Hercules away on another perilous adventure."

      "body": "I stood on the deck of S.S. Rajula. As she slowly moved out of Madras harbor, I waved to my grandparents till I could see them no more. I was thrilled to be on board a ship. It was a new experience for me.\n\n\"Are you travelling alone?\" asked the person standing next to me.\n\n\"Yes, Uncle, I'm going back to my parents in Singapore,\" I replied.\n\n\"What's your name?\" he asked.\n\n\"Vasantha,\" I replied.\n\nI spent the day exploring the ship. It looked just like a big house. There were furnished rooms, a swimming pool, a room for indoor games and a library. Yet, there was plenty of room to move around.\n\nThe next morning the passengers were seated in the dining hall, having breakfast. The loudspeaker spluttered noisily and then the captain's voice came loud and clear. \"Friends we have just received a message that a storm is brewing in the Indian Ocean. I request all of you to keep calm.\n\nDo not panic. Those who are inclined to sea-sickness may please stay in their cabins. Thank you.\"\n\nThere was panic everywhere. An old lady prayed aloud, \"Oh God! Have mercy on us. My only son is waiting for me in Singapore.\"\n\nA gentleman consoled her, \"Don't worry, Madam, it's only a warning. We may not be affected at all.\"\n\nAnother lady, who was sitting beside me, looked very ill. \"Not rough weather! I'm already seasick.\n\nA rough sea will be the end of me!\"\n\nI could not understand why all the elders were so upset. I remembered the several sea adventures I had read. Excitedly, I turned to the elderly gentleman sitting next to me. \"Uncle, won't it be thrilling to face a storm on board a steamer? Have you ever been on a ship during a storm?\"\n\n\"It can be quite unpleasant, you know,\" he replied rather severely. \"I remember a time when the ship on which I was travelling ran off course.\n\nWe were wandering on the ocean for a couple of days.\"\n\nI remembered my class teacher, an English woman, telling us in class one day, \"When I crossed the English Channel on my way to Singapore, there was a big storm near Gibraltar. The ship rocked to and from. Everything in the cabins rolled up and down. Even the heavy pianos in the lounge went crashing against the walls.\"\n\nThis made my imagination run wild. Turning to Uncle again, I said, \"Wouldn't it be fun if the storm broke when we have lunch? Then the tables, with all the food on them, would run away from us. And the chairs, with us sitting on them, would be a merry-go-round.\"\n\nEveryone round the table stared at me in horror. I thought to myself, 'Oh, these adults, they've no sense of adventure. How dull they are!\n\nThe storm didn't break, but in the evening a strong wind started blowing. The ship rocked to and from, rocking and rolling to the music of the wind. Huge waves were dashing against it. Even though the deck was slippery, I was running around. That's when I noticed Uncle leaning over the railings. I ran up to him, thinking he too, was enjoying the experience. \"Good morning, Uncle, isn't it lovely?\" I asked him.\n\nBut he wasn't well at all. He was retching over the rails and looked rather blue about the mouth. I felt sorry for him. \"Can I be of any help? Shall I call the doctor?' I asked him.\n\nHe couldn't reply, but only held up his hand.\n\nAs another bout of retching shook him he leaned over the railings. At the same time a huge wave lashed the ship. It lurched violently and the man tumbled over the railings into the wild sea. For a second I stood rooted to the spot. Then I ran like someone possessed, shouting, and “Help! Help!\n\nMan overboard! Save him!\" I must have made a lot of noise. I heard footsteps hurrying even that early in the morning.\n\nTears streaming down my face and shouting incoherently, I ran full pelt into an officer.\n\n\"What's the matter? Why are you making so much noise?\" he asked in a stern voice, I was surprised to see it was the captain.\n\n\"Oh Sir!\" I blurted out in relief. \"A man fell into the sea. Please save him.\"\n\n\"Where?\" he asked, immediately on the alert.\n\n\"There,\" I said pointing a finger.\n\nHe did not wait for more details but ran at once to a room full of officers. \"Man overboard,\" he cried. \"Stop ship. Drop anchor. Quick!\" His instructions were immediately obeyed. The captain then raced to the upper deck. I kept trailing behind him. \"Lower the life-boats and crew into the sea towards the helm,\" he said. \"There is a man overboard.\" Here again the men quickly obeyed him.\n\nPeople started crowding the deck. \"What's happening?\" somebody asked me.\n\nWord soon went round. Everyone was tense.\n\nOnly an occasional, \"There he is!\" could be heard. Someone asked, \"Who is he?\"\n\nAnother replied, \"Don't know.\"\n\nMeanwhile two life-boats moved towards the man. I stood close to the captain. In his anxiety, he gripped my shoulder tightly and I winced.\n\n\"You're hurting me Sir,\" I protested.\n\n\"I am sorry, my dear. The sea is very rough today. I hope my men can reach him in time. My ship has never lost a passenger before,\" he said crossing himself. He was watching the rescue operations through a pair of binoculars that hung round his neck.\n\nThe boat was too far for me to see what was happening. I tugged at the Captain's sleeve.\n\n\"What are they doing, Sir? Have they rescued the man?\" I asked him.\n\n\"They've caught him by the arms and are pulling him towards the boat.\" He was giving me a running commentary. \"Oh what bad luck! A sudden current has swept the man away dragging two of the sailors with him.\" He sounded nervous.\n\nJust then he noticed the passengers crowding against the railings. \"Keep away from those railings!\" he shouted. \"We don't want another accident.\" The ship had dropped anchor but was heaving up and down.\n\nI borrowed the captain's binoculars. Now I could see the rescue operation clearly. The crew in the rescue boats threw a strong rope to the two sailors in the sea and shouted, \"Catch\". Both of them were good swimmers and soon had caught hold of the rope. Then, with powerful strokes, they swam towards Uncle. One of them caught hold of him, while the other tied the rope round his waist. With Uncle between them and the rope secure, the sailors swam back to the life-boats. The rescue team in the boats leaned over and heaved the three men into it. In a jiffy the boats were heading back to the ship.\n\n\"Thank God!\" muttered the captain making the sign of the cross again, \"They've managed to save him.\" He turned to the passengers thronging the railings. \"Please do not crowd round the man when he is brought up. He will need immediate medical care.\" Then he saw the ship's doctor standing with a couple of nurses. A stretcher was also being brought close to the railings.\n\n\"Doctor! Is everything ready for the patient?\" the captain asked.\n\n\"Aye, aye, Captain,\" nodded the doctor. The captain moved away to restore order on the ship. I edged close to the doctor and asked, \"What will you do to him, doctor? Will he be all right?\"\n\n\"Aye, I think so. All the water will have to be pumped out of him. He'll have to be given artificial respiration and kept warm.\"\n\n\"How do you pump the water out?\" I asked.\n\n\"We put him on his stomach and massage him until he brings it all up,\" he replied.\n\nAs soon as the rescue team reached the ship, Uncle was placed on the stretcher and rushed to the hospital room. The captain then came to me and said, \"Run along now and play with your friends. I'm busy, but will send for you when I'm through. I might even have a surprise for you.\"\n\nWhen he turned away, I quietly sneaked into the hospital room to see what they were doing to the patient. Two nurses were scurrying to and from with trays full of medicines and syringes. Another was rushing off with Uncle's wet clothes. I stopped her and asked if Uncle was conscious. \"Not yet,\" she replied, \"but he's better now. He should regain consciousness in a little while.\"\n\nThe ship was still rolling, so I couldn't play any games. I went and sat in a cozy chair in the lounge and started reading a story-book. I was feeling drowsy and must have dozed off. The next tiling I knew was somebody saying, \"Wake up, child. You're Vasantha, aren't you? The Captain wants to see you in his cabin.\"\n\nI looked up to see a sailor standing before me.\n\nIt took me a minute to recollect the rescue operation and the captain telling me, \"I'll call you afterwards.\"\n\nI followed the officer eagerly. He left me outside the captain's door, saying, and “Go right inside.\"\n\nI knocked and entered. The captain was standing in the middle of the room. When he saw me, he came forward and literally swept me off my feet. He was still smiling when he put me down.\n\n\"You will have plenty to tell your friends, eh? Now close your eyes.\"\n\nI did so. Seconds later, I heard him say, \"See what I've got for you.\"\n\nOn opening my eyes, I saw a big brown box.\n\nOn it was written….\"WITH THE BEST COMPLIMENTS OF CAPT. LINDSAY.\"\n\nI took the box and eagerly opened it. \"Oh, what a lovely ship!\" I exclaimed. \"Does this really belong to me? Can I keep it?\"\n\n\nLying snugly on a velvet backing was a most beautiful model of the ship. On it was inscribed \"B.I.S.N. And Co. S.S. RAJULA.\" I placed the box carefully on the table. Then I threw my hands round the captain and hugged and kissed him.\n\nHe patted my cheek and smiled as he saw me lift the box and walk happily out of his room. I proudly showed my present to everyone I met.\n\n\"See what the Captain has given me. Isn't it lovely?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" was the unanimous verdict?\n\nI was the happiest person on board that day."

      "body": "Once up a time there were three monkeys. Daddy monkey, Mummy monkey and Baby monkey. They lived in a tree on the plains in Africa. There was not much to do in their tree, they were bored.\n\n“I’m bored\" said Baby monkey.\n\n“Let’s go shopping,\" said Mummy monkey.\n\n“Don’t be stupid,\" said Daddy monkey, “we’ve not got any cash.\"\n\n“We don’t need cash,\" replied Mummy monkey. “We’re monkeys.\"\n\n“Now that is a good point,\" said Daddy monkey.\n\n“So how do we get into town?\" asked Baby monkey.\n\n“Get the bus of course. How else. We can’t drive a car,\" replied dad.\n\n“A number 44, should be along fairly soon,\" said Mummy monkey. “We could get that. It goes right into the center of the city.\"\n\nThe monkeys wandered over to the bus top avoiding the lions who were looking very hungry that morning and waited for a bus.\n\nSoon enough a number 44 came along and they jumped on.\n\n“Fairs please,\" said the driver.\n\nThe monkeys just ignored the driver as they didn’t have the correct change, because they didn’t have pockets because they were monkeys.\n\nHave you ever noticed the handles on straps on buses that hang down from the rails on buses? That’s in case the bus ever stops in Africa and monkeys want to get on. Or South America, there are monkeys there and they have prehensile tails which means they can hang from them using their tails. However I have digressed.\n\nThe monkeys started swinging on the straps as monkeys are inclined to do. After all they are monkeys, but not using their tails as they were African monkeys.\n\n“Oi,\" said the driver. “Monkeys stop that!\"\n\nThe monkeys being monkeys just ignored the driver, after all they never do anything a human tells them. That’s why they don’t make good pets. So children never ask your mummy or daddy for a pet monkey. It will just wreck your house. Oops I’ve digressed again.\n\nThe driver stopped the bus, they were still in the middle of the savannah. “Right monkeys, off the bus,\" the driver shouted.\n\nThe monkeys jumped out of a window, as the driver was looking quite angry. The window had been left open because it was a really hot day, which it often is in Africa.\n\nThe three monkeys then went and sat on the roof. The driver didn’t notice what the monkeys had done and soon the bus started off again. The monkeys could hear the driver mutter ruse words like ‘poo’ under his breath.\n\n“Hey look\" Baby Monkey shouted.\n\n“What?\" replied Mummy monkey.\n\n“There’s some giraffes\"\n\n“Well yes you get giraffes in Africa,\" Daddy monkey replied.\n\n“Why don’t we get any near our tree?\"\n\n“The lions scare them off.\"\n\n“Can’t we ask the lions not to eat them?\"\n\n“Well we don’t want the giraffes coming and eating our leaves do we?\"\n\n“I suppose not,\" Baby monkey replied.\n\nSoon they reached the city center and spotted a particularly large shop.\n\n“I want to go shopping in there,\" said Mummy monkey pointing to that large department store and jumping off the bus roof.\n\n“What are you going to get?\" asked Daddy following.\n\n“Shoes and a dress, I’m a lady monkey. What else do ladies get in the shops?\n\n“What are you going to get?\" she asked.\n\n“Don’t know,\" perhaps the latest Manchester United top.\n\n“Man United, I didn’t know you liked football. Anyway, we don’t live in Manchester, we live in Africa.\"\n\n“Most Manchester supporters don’t live in Manchester.\"\n\n“Yes but you should support a local team?\"\n\n“Such as?\"\n\n“I don’t know what they’re called but some of the gazelles have taken to kicking some stones about.\"\n\n“It’s hardly the same is it?\"\n\n“No I suppose not, so what else are you going to get?\"\n\n“A big, flat screen tally.\"\n\n“So how are you going to get that home?\"\n\n“On the bus of course.\"\n\n“We don’t have anywhere to plug it in, I don’t know if you’d noticed but there aren’t many sockets in our tree.\"\n\n“I’m going to get a solar powered one.\"\n\n“What about at night when the Man U are playing in the Champions league.\"\n\n“We’ll have to record it,\" Daddy monkey said and went and hung from a light fitting.\n\n“What can I get,\" asked Baby Monkey.\n\n“Whatever you like,\" replied his mother.\n\n“I want a comic and an ice cream because I’m hot and I want a radio controlled helicopter to annoy the lions with and a lot of Lego to build a tree just like our, so we can live in a Lego tree and I want car and a train set and a Barbie doll.\"\n\n“What do you want a Barbie for?\" Daddy asked from his light.\n\n“Let him have a Barbie,\" mother said.\n\n“Cause she’s a monkey doctor, that’s her new job.\" Baby added, “Monkey doctor. She can cure you if you get an itchy bottom.\"\n\n“I never get an itchy bottom.\" Daddy Monkey replied indignantly.\n\n“Why do you keep scratching it then?\" Mother asked.\n\n“I’m a monkey, monkeys are supposed to scratch their bottoms.\"\n\nMummy monkey was no longer listening, she had spotted a pair of shoes and like most females, all thoughts went out of her brain at the sight of some shiny new shoes.\n\n“I’m having those shoes,\" she said.\n\n“Of course dear,\" Daddy monkey replied looking round the shop for some football tops and televisions.\n\nMummy monkey ran over and grabbed the shoes, but she was a monkey and had size one feet, whereas the shoes were size four and they didn’t fit so as soon as she tried them on they just fell off.\n\nTry stuffing a newspaper in them?\" Father suggested.\n\n“Oh good idea,\"\n\nMummy monkey go a copy of Hello, and used the latest celebrity wedding to keep her shoes on.\n\n“This isn’t a funny comic.\" Baby monkey said picking up what he thought was a comic.\n\n“That’s because it’s the News of the Word,\" Daddy replied. “They’re difficult to tell apart. Comics have better stories though.\"\n\n“Oh no we’ve been rumbled.\" He shouted as he saw a group of humans coming towards them. Let’s scarper.\"\n\nMummy monkey raced after her monkey husband in her three-inch high stilettos with pages of hello trailing after her. They ran through to the next department, perfume.\n\n“Oh I have to try these,\" she said.\n\nBouncing off the counters the three monkeys jumped and grabbed perfume bottles from the orange faced women. Each one was hastily applied by Mummy monkey and so Britney Spears’ latest concoction soon mingled with parfum de monkey in an ever increasing assault to the nose.\n\nStill being chased by an increasing number of humans the monkeys then ran through into the women’s clothing department, which took up sixty percent of the store and Mummy monkey grabbed a small black cocktail dress as she bounced past.\n\nThe monkeys ran out of the store and onto the top of a number 27 bus going past.\n\n“There’s a 44 going back to our tree.\" Daddy shouted as bus went past in the opposite direction. The three monkeys jumped from the top of one bus to the other bus.\n\nMummy monkey nearly dropped her Hello covered shoes as they did.\n\nAn hour later the monkeys were sitting in their tree. Daddy monkey hadn’t got his solar powered, flat screen tally or his football top.\n\nBaby Monkey had got a rubbish comic that wasn’t what he really wanted.\n\nMummy Monkey had got a nice black dress, a pair of shoes that don’t quite fit and some perfume.\n\nSo all in all a pretty normal shopping trip then."

One night, he stealthily entered the store room where his grandfather kept his priceless antiques. Simon knew his grandfather did not like anyone to touch his rare collections.\n\nOnce inside the room, Simon stood on a chair. He lifted the box wherein his grandfather had kept many wrist-watches bought from different countries he had visited.\n\nWhile getting down from the chair, Simon’s elbow struck against the chair. The box slipped out of his hands and fell onto the floor. All the watched lay scattered all around. To his utter shock, he found the glass of his grandfather’s favorite watch broken.\n\nSimon got frightened lest his grandfather should come to know about the broken glass. He started picking up the pieces of glass.\n\nSimon thought, “How will I tell my grandfather that his favorite watch had got broken? He will be angry with me. If I do not tell him, he will not come to know about it.\"\n\nSimon got nervous. His heart started beating faster. He put the broken watch back into the box and placed the box back on the shelf. Afterwards, he went to sleep. He tossed and turned in bed. He could not sleep in peace throughout the whole night.\n\nThe next morning, Simon got up early. He gathered courage to go and admit his fault to his grandfather. Reaching his grandfather’s bedroom he told him everything. The grandfather looked thoughtful. He did not say anything to Simon. He went over to the store room. Simon kept standing with his head down.\n\nHaving returned from the store the grandfather said to Simon, “I felt very angry when you had broken my precious watch. Your grandmother gifted it to me on our first wedding anniversary. But you need not worry. Only the glass is broken. I shall have it replaced.\"\n\nSimon felt relieved. After some time, his grandfather went into kitchen and bought a glass of milk for him.\n\nWhile giving the milk to Simon, his grandfather said, “It was brave enough of you to tell me about the broken watch. You knew that I would scold you, did not you?\"\n\nSimon said, “I was scared at first. But I dared not tell a lie. I should not have touched your things without your permission.\"\n\nSimon’s grandfather further remarked, “When I was at your age, I also broke my mother’s precious flower-case. I was scared to own up my mistake. But, when I went to confess, she said that she already knew about it.\"\n\nIt is brave to admit your mistake. You may be scared of being scolded.

However, those who are true to the positive and joys of life will see this story for what it really is — The true way we should view life and all its wonders.\n\nRead the story below and let it change your thinking about life!\n\nTwo men are seriously ill and in the same hospital room. For an hour each day, the nurses would let the man closest to the room’s only window sit up in order to help drain the fluid in his lungs.\n\nThe other man in the room spent all his time flat on his back.\n\nAs you can imagine, with little else to do, the men would talk for hours.

The nurses were happy to oblige him and they made the switch.\n\nOnce they were gone, the man slowly and painfully pulled himself up so he could take his first good look at the world outside the hospital room, the world whose description had brought him so much comfort.\n\nTo his dismay, he found that the view was not as vibrant as he’d been told; in fact, the window faced a blank wall.\n\nUpset, the man called for the nurse and explained the situation.\n\n“Why would he lie to me?\" he questioned the nurse.\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, the nurse looked at him and said:\n\n“Maybe he just wanted to encourage you.\"\n\nThis should be a lesson to all of us that no matter our situation, we can do tremendous good for those around us by looking on the bright side of every situation.\n\nEven when we’re faced with what seems like an impenetrable brick wall, we can bring so much happiness and joy to those around us if we find positive ways of looking at the world.\n\nThe man in the story could just as easily have described the bland, brick wall that stood outside the window but instead of simply passing along his misery and grief, he shared whatever happiness he did have, doubling it."

      "body": "I am only 24 years old, yet I have actually already chosen my last tie. It’s the one that I will wear on my funeral a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion.\n\nThe cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing abut death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions.\n\nThe way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful you existed with your contributions.\n\nBefore, there were so many things that occupied my mind. When I learned now much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason….I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized: you existed with your contributions.\n\nDon’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy. It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like. Patience, passion and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.\n\nIt’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you're a legend.\n\nTake control of your life. Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.\n\nAppreciate the people around you. Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted.\n\nIt is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. I’m not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI or Elon Musks next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon. We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it. You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. I hope you will make the right choice. Leave a mark in this world. Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that mess with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!"

Frederick became the Duke.\n\nThe Duke had a daughter. Her name was Rosalind. Frederick also had a daughter. Her name was Celia. Rosalind and Celia were fond each other from their childhood. Celia wanted Rosalind to be with her in the palace. Frederick allowed Rosalind to be in the palace with his daughter. This was for the sake of his own daughter, Celia.\n\nSir Rowland De Boys was friend of the elder Duke who was in the forest. Sir Rowland died leaving all his property to his eldest son whose name was Oliver. Oliver was jealous of his younger brother whose name was Orlando. Oliver did not give any part of the property or money to Orlando. He did not even educate Orlando either.\n\nIn Duke Frederick’s court, there was a powerful wrestler. His name was Charles. No young man dared to challenge Charles. But Orlando accepted the challenge. Oliver met Charles secretly. He instructed Charles to do the worst to Orlando.\n\nAt the wrestling place there were many people. Duke Frederick was also there. In the earlier matches Charles threw little challengers one after another. All the three challengers had broken their ribs. They were struggling for life. Celia and Rosalind also had come there. Duke Frederick asked the girls to talk to the young man, Orlando. Frederick had felt that Charles would throw Orlando down in the fight. The girls approached Orlando. They requested him not to fight. Orlando refused gently. He said, “I have no one to care for me. I do not care even to die.\"\n\nThe match began. Orlando was much stronger than Charles. Orlando lifted Charles above his shoulders. Then he threw him down. Charles became unconscious after falling. Frederick and all others were happy. They congratulated Orlando. Orlando told Frederick, “I am the second son of late Sir Rowland de Boys.\"\n\nFrederick did not like Orlando from that minute onwards, because Frederick had not liked Sir Rowland de Boys.\n\nThe two girls on the contrary praised Orlando. Rosalind was happy. Sit Rowland had been her father’s friend. She then took out a chain from her neck and presented it to Orlando. This was the reward for his bravery."

It's the third time this week!\"\n\nThey pushed the food aside. \"We can get something at the burger place after school,\" Raman said. They concentrated on studying for their English test instead of eating. English was next period, and Mr. Frank had a reputation for giving difficult tests. When the bell rang, they dropped their uneaten lunches into the garbage. Mr. Frank was standing nearby. \"Not hungry, guys?\" he asked. They shook their heads and hurried off to class.\n\nWhen the test was over, there were still ten minutes left in the period. Mr. Frank stood at the front of the class. \"Before you leave today,\" he said, leaning against the desk, \"I'd like to share an old African folktale with you. I think you'll find this one interesting. It's called 'Why the Sky Is Far Away'\"\n\nLong ago the sky was close to the Earth. Men and women did not have to plant their own food. Instead, when they were hungry, they just reached up and broke off a piece of the sky to eat. Sometimes the sky tasted like ripe bananas. Other times it tasted like roasted potatoes. The sky was always delicious.\n\nPeople spent their time making beautiful cloth. They painted beautiful pictures and sang songs at night. The grand king, Oba, had a wonderful palace. His servants made beautiful shapes out of pieces of sky.\n\nMany people in the kingdom did not use the gift of the sky wisely. When they took more than they could eat, the sky became angry. Some people threw the extra pieces into the garbage.\n\nEarly one morning the angry sky turned dark. Black clouds hung over the land and a great sky voice said to all the people, \"You are wasting my gift of food. Do not take more than you can eat. I don't want to see pieces of me in the garbage anymore or I will take my gift away.\"\n\nThe king and the people trembled with fear. King Oba said, \"Let's be careful about how much food we take.\" For a long time, all the people were careful.\n\nBut one man named Adami wasn't careful. At festival time, he took so many delicious pieces of sky that he couldn't eat them all. He knew he must not throw them away.\n\nHe tried to give the pieces to his wife. \"Here, wife,\" Adami said. \"You eat the rest.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Adami's wife said. \"I'm too full.\"\n\nAdami asked all his children to help him eat the delicious pieces of sky, but the children couldn't eat one more bite. So Adami decided to try to hide the pieces at the bottom of the garbage pile.\n\nSuddenly, the sky became angry and the clouds turned black. \"You have wasted my gift of food again,\" yelled the sky.\n\n\"This time I will go away so you cannot waste me anymore.\"\n\nAll of the people cried, \"What will we eat? We might starve!\"\n\nThe sky said, \"You will have to learn how to plant crops in the ground and hunt in the forests. If you work hard, you may learn not to waste the gifts of nature.\"\n\nEveryone watched as the sky sailed away. From that time on, they worked hard to grow their food and cook their meals. They always tried to remember not to waste the gifts of nature.\n\nThe bell rang for the next period. \"That's the end,\" Mr. Frank said, smiling. He looked at Raman and Bhim.\n\n\"What did you think of the story?\" he asked. They slouched in their chairs and looked apologetic.\n\n\"We get the message,\" they said, smiling. \"No more lunches in the garbage!\""

      "title": "When Papa Scolded Me",
      "body": "\"Baby, come for breakfast. Your milk is getting cold,\" called Bhaiya, my elder brother. I quickly put on my slippers, picked up my favorite doll, Beeta and rushed out into the verandah. It was a beautiful day. The morning air was most refreshing. \"Ah, how lovely!\" I said aloud, taking a deep breath. I ran across the verandah, with Beeta tucked under my arm.\n\nWhile I gulped down the milk, I heard Papa calling out to the driver.\n\n\"Papa is still here, Bhaiya. He hasn't gone to the clinic, today,\" I said overwhelmed with joy.\n\nBeing engrossed in a magazine, Bhaiya did not reply, but I could see Papa talking to someone in his room, which was opposite the dining hall facing the verandah.\n\n\"Papa! Papa! I don't have to go to school, it's a holiday. Do you have a holiday, too? Look, Beeta has got fever,\" I said, all in one breath.\n\n\"No, my dear child, I don't have a holiday today. You go and play while I talk to Mr. Singh.\n\nHe is very ill. I'll ask the compounder to give your doll some medicine,\" Papa said lovingly.\n\nIt was quite unusual to find my father at home at that time. Normally he was in his clinic before I woke up. So I was very happy. My father wiped his spectacles with the kerchief as he listened to his patient carefully.\n\nI was on the balcony when I heard, \"Baby! Baby! Come here, see this.\" It was my brother from the verandah. He had spread himself on an easy chair and our dog, Tom, was dancing round on his hind legs. I burst out laughing.\n\n\"Papa will give medicine to Beeta,\" I said, showing off.\n\n\"And I'll ask Papa to give some medicine to his darling daughter, because. . . .Because she laughs and laughs,\" said Bhaiya, tickling me and sending me into fits of laughter. Being the youngest child in the family I received everyone's attention and affection. Papa of course, was the most affectionate.\n\nI ran from one end of the verandah to the other and then onto the balcony, staying close to Papa's room to attract his attention while I played. I swung on the curtain, thumped on the door, tapped on the table, pulled and pushed the chair.\n\n\"Look, Bhaiya, what a variety of sounds they make,\" I said, pulling the chair, then leaping up and rapping on the door, clapping my hands, jumping all the while.\n\n\"Don't,\" pleaded Bhaiya, not taking his eyes off the book in his hand.\n\nRacing back to the window of Papa's room, I saw him still busy with the patient. I loved to see him there before me, while I played. 'He must like it, too,' I thought, 'to see me play around in his room.'\n\nI dragged a chair and climbed onto the table.\n\nThis at last drew Papa's attention.\n\n\"Baby, be careful, you'll fall down,\" he said tenderly.\n\n\"Look, Papa, I am taller than everyone,\" I grinned from ear to ear making my eyes disappear.\n\nAll one could see was a set of white teeth and chubby cheeks.\n\nBoth Mr. Singh and Papa smiled. Papa did not look convinced. So I said again raising my hands above my head. \"Papa I'm a big girl, now.\"\n\nHe nodded with a smile and continued talking to the patient.\n\nI touched all that I could reach with my hands till I got to the black switch. 'No, you should not touch it.' I was imagining what my mother would have said.\n\n'If you touch it, you'll get hurt,' Bhaiya had told me once. This was a 'forbidden' article for me, but how attractive it looked — black against the light blue wall. Unable to resist the temptation to touch it, I pressed the switch and the light came on. I immediately switched it off. I was scared, I looked at Papa with large anxious eyes, but he was busy writing. He did not see me. I looked at Papa again and then at the switch which begged my hands to touch it again.\n\n'I'll do it just once more, okay?' I said softly to myself. I repeated the mischief once more and was unable to stop myself from doing it again and again. I seemed to have disturbed Papa who concentrating on the patient's problem. Without looking up from the book, he said in a serious voice, \"Don't do that, you might get a shock.\"\n\nThe klick-klack of the switch and the glowing bulb fascinated me, \"Baby, come here, let Papa do his work,\" called my brother.\n\nI ignored everybody. This was the most fascinating game for me at the moment.\n\nHow fantastic! I press — the light is on, I push — the light goes off', I muttered.\n\nThe patient, obviously, had some serious problem.\n\nMy father sat with four books open in front of him. My running around had certainly disturbed him. Completely exasperated, he put down his pen and spectacles and shouted at me, \"You're not listening to me. GET DOWN FROM THERE!\"\n\nHis loud voice broke my trance. I gaped at him wide-eyed. He fixed his gaze on me, expecting to be obeyed instantly. I was shocked at being scolded so loudly by him — scolded by Papa. Papa, a very soft spoken person, who was known never to raise his voice, had SHOUTED in anger at his darling daughter. I was very angry with him.\n\nI jumped down from the table with a loud thud and raced up and down the balcony. My breath quickened, my face went red with anger and my eyes felt hot with unshed tears. Throwing my hands about, I raced up and down wanting to destroy everything that came in my way.\n\nHearing the commotion Bhaiya came out.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked. My fury found a ready victim and I ran towards him and pushed him. I felt like bursting into tears. I rushed and pulled at the curtain in Papa's room, which came down with the force. I saw Papa talking to the patient with his usual patience.\n\nHow unthoughtful of him! He is not a bit bothered about my being so angry with him. I was fuming all the more.\n\nI went back into the room, stamping my feet noisily in anger. Standing close to Papa, I raged vehemently, \"Why couldn't you say it softly?\n\nWhy did you speak so loudly to me?\"\n\nThe next moment I came out on the balcony and stood beside the money-plant pot. My eyes were now full of tears. I plucked a leaf and shredded it to pieces. The sound of a chair being pushed in Papa's room reached my ears and then I heard his footsteps coming closer to me. I tried to run away in annoyance, but Papa caught me. He pulled my face towards his and picked me up. Tears came rolling down my plump cheeks. He patted my head lovingly and wiped my tears.\n\n\"Oh, you big cat!\" said Papa, ruffling my hair.\n\nThis affectionate gesture melted my wrath. A moment later I was once again happy playing round the house.\n"

Soon the trolley was full of stuff.\n\n“What do we do now?\" Mummy tiger asked.\n\nDaddy tiger would have shrugged his shoulders in reply if he knew how to do it, but he said, “go up to the tills,\" in reply.\n\nThe three tiger went up to the tills and Mummy tiger jumped onto the counter.\n\n“Now what?\" she asked.\n\n“You open the tills and put something in it.\"\n\n“What sort of thing?\"\n\n“I don’t know, see what’s already in it?\"\n\nMummy tiger then used her claws to try and open the till. It fell on the floor.\n\n“Oops,\" she said as piles of paper and round pieces of metal fell out.\n\n“Well I don’t have any round pieces of metal,\" Daddy tiger said.\n\n“We could take some of the paper off the other things and leave them in the till.\" Mummy suggested.\n\n“Is this chocolate?\" Baby tiger asked picking up a Twirl.\n\n“I think so.\" Daddy tiger replied.\n\n“Why don’t we take the paper off the chocolate and put them in the till.\" Baby suggested.\n\n“Good idea,\" Mummy tiger replied. So the three tigers started unwrapping chocolate bars, until they had two piles, one of chocolate and the other of paper.\n\n“Right help me put the till back on the counter,\" Daddy tiger said. So the two grownup tigers started tiger-handling the till back onto the counter. Meanwhile Baby tiger just stared at the slightly melting pile of chocolate.\n\n“Here goes,\" Baby tiger said and he buried his head in the chocolate. “YUK! Chocolate is horrible, I don’t like it.\"\n\n“Never mind son,\" Mummy tiger said. “Remember we’re tigers and we eat gazelles and antelopes, not chocolate. Get back into the trolley we’ll push you back through the jungle.\"\n\nSo Baby tiger sat on the front of the trolley with a saucepan on his head, while his two parents pushed him through the car park and to the edge of the jungle where the wheels of the trolley got stuck in the mud.\n\n“We’ll just have to carry stuff from here.\" Daddy tiger said.\n\nSo the three tigers unloaded the contents of the trolley, and struggled back to their tiger-home in the jungle.\n\n“What do you want for tea?\" Mummy tiger asked. “Gazelle or Antelope?\"\n\n“What about ice-cream?\" Baby tiger replied, “I’ve heard that’s very nice.\""

The operator hesitantly told me there was a number, but the best she could do was call it and see if they wanted to be connected. I learned that Hannah was now living in a Nursing Home. And was given the number.\n\nIt seemed silly, wanting to contact someone over a letter written 60 years ago, but I felt impelled. I was told that Hannah was there and though it was fairly late I followed my instinct and went to see her.\n\nShe was a sweet silver-haired lady with a warm smile and a twinkle in her eye. 1 told her about finding the wallet and showed her the letter.\n\nShe took a deep breath and said, \"Young man, this letter was the last contact I ever had with Michael.\"\n\nShe said softly \"I loved him very much. But I was only 16 at the time and my mother felt I was too young. \"If you should find him, tell him I still love him.\"\n\nWith tears in her eyes she told me she had never married because no one had matched up to him in her heart.\n\nI thanked her and left. As I was waiting by the elevator the nurse there asked, \"Was Hannah able to help you?\"\n\nI'd taken out the wallet as she was speaking and she said \"Hey, wait a minute that's Michael Goldstein's wallet. I'd recognize it anywhere, he's always losing it.\"\n\nMy hands began to shake. \"Who's Michael Goldstein?\" I asked.\n\n\"One of the residents on the 8th floor. That's his wallet for sure.\"\n\nI dashed up to the 8th floor and the nurse on duty told me he was still in the day room.\n\nWe went into the day room and as soon as Michael saw the wallet a smile of relief crossed his face. I confessed I'd read the letter in an attempt to find the owner of the wallet. The smile on his face disappeared.\n\n\"But I think you'll be happy I did,\" I said. I think I know where Hannah is.\n\nHe grew pale. \"Where is she? How is she? Please tell me he begged. \"She's fine I said quietly.\" \"I was so in love with that girl and when that letter came, my life came to a halt. I never married. I guess I've always loved her.\"\n\nI asked him to come with me and took him down to the 3rd floor where Hannah was sitting alone, watching television. The floor nurse pointed to Michael. \"Do you know this man Hannah?\" She adjusted her glasses but didn't speak. Michael whispered, \"Hannah it's me, Michael.

The lamb casually went into the forest and played there for a long time till it turned dark in the evening.\n\nOne day, as usual the lamb wandered far off into the forest. There he saw a spring. “I am thirsty. Let me drink some water,\" he thought. He decided to take water from the spring for his thirsty. While the lamb was drinking water in the spring, a wolf watched from behind a tree.\n\n“A lamb! My lucky day!\" the wolf thought, approaching the lamb. The lamb was not aware of the wolf for some time. There was no one besides these two animals to save the lamb from the wolf.\n\n“You know this forest belongs only to wild animals like me. Why have you come in here to take water from this spring?\" asked the wolf.\n\nThe lamb knew that wolves were dangerous animals. “Mother has warned me about wolves. I am sure this fellow wants to eat me for his lunch. This fellow is ferocious. I must escape from this animal,\" he thought.\n\nThe wolf continued, “You are also dirtying water. How will I drink this polluted water now?\"\n\n“But the spring flows from where you are standing down to where I am standing, Sir!\" said the lamb, in a meek voice. The wolf was surprised to hear such an intelligent answer from the lamb. But the wolf was just looking for an excuse to kill the lamb. “How dare you argue with me? I think you are the same lamb who had abused me last year,\" the wolf shouted.\n\n“Last year? Bur Sir, I was not even born then!\" the lamb squeaked. The lamb feared that the wolf was looking after a pretext to kill the lamb. The lamb became cautious of its words and gestures. This way both the lamb and the wolf talked to each other cautiously.\n\nThe lamb heard some woodcutters. They were coming the way in which the lamb and the wolf were standing. “\"If I can keep talking to this wolf for a little while longer, the woodcutters will be here. They will chase him away,\" thought the clever lamb. So, he said, “Mr. Wolf, you are right. I have dirtied the water. But, I did not mean to upset you.\"\n\nThis way the lamb kept on talking for few more minutes. As the lamb spoke, the woodcutters arrived. They saw both the lamb and the wolf.\n\nThey caught the wolf and beat him before letting him go. The lamb was relieved to be safe. He ran back to his mother. He told her his mother what had happened in the forest with the wolf and the woodcutter. And then he promised his mother never to wander into the forest again.\n"

Its front legs were detached completely. Nature is not gentle to any kind of incapability. If you lose your legs, you lose your life. Yet, the fox looked well-fed and healthy. Rama was surprised. But he ignored it and focused on his meditation. As the sun set, Rama heard the roar of a lion. He forgot about his meditation and climbed up a tree. To his astonishment, a full grown male lion came with a piece of meat, dropped it in front of the fox and went away. Rama couldn't believe this…if furious lion is feeding a crippled fox. Next evening, the lion came again with a piece of meat, dropped it in front of the fox and went away. Rama took this as a message that God was sending him. He had his own interpretation….Even a crippled fox in this forest is being fed by a lion and you fool, just sit here and food will come to you.\n\nOne day. two days, three days, meditation became more like a struggle for Rama.

I wish I could get some of this load taken off my back.\" Just then the donkey tripped and fell into the water.\n\nFortunately, the donkey was not hurt. But the sack of salt on the donkey’s back fell into the water. Both the donkey and the salt became wet. Some of the salt in the sack got dissolved, making the load on the donkey lighter. The donkey felt very happy about the reduction in the weight of the sack of salt on its back. The merchant did his best to help the donkey to get up and they carried on their journey.\n\nFrom that day, it became a regular practice for the donkey to slip and fall in the pond whenever they crossed the pond to the market.

The donkey was astonished at what had taken place against the usual result.\n\nThe merchant looked at the donkey and said, “Dear friend, I saw you fall into the water of the pond deliberately every day with the malicious intention of reducing the weight of the salt. So, I loaded a sack of cotton today. Cotton when wet gets more weight and becomes heavier. Now you will have to carry it to the town.\" The poor donkey had learnt his lesson."

I will sing him a song,\" thought the crow.\n\nAs soon as the foolish crow opened his mouth to sing the bread fell from its beak and into the ground. The Clever fox, which had just been waiting for this very moment, caught the bread in his mouth and gulped it down his throat.\n\nThe crow had paid a heavy price for his foolishness."

      "title": "The Clever Bull",
      "body": "There was a forest with many birds and animals. Once, a bull wandering in the forest came upon a cave. Near the cave was a big pond and lush green grass. “This is an ideal place for me to settle down,\" the bull thought. So, he made the cave his home. Many days passed. The bull became quite healthy, grazing in the meadows. The bull was happy and peaceful living in that cave. He had made many friends in that forest.\n\nOne day, the bull was resting outside his cave house. A lion happened to come by that way. The lion was happy to have spotted a bull after a long time. “Aha! A bull! He is so healthy too,\" thought the majestic lion, licking his lips in anticipation of a good meal. The bull too noticed the lion. He could sense danger. I must be on my guard now,\" the bull thought and decided to do something to hide himself from the lion.\n\nWhen the lion came close to the bull, the clever bull looked into the cave and called out, “Darling, do not cook anything for dinner. I have just spotted a lion. I am waiting for it to come near.\" When the lion heard the bull, he returned around and ran for his life.\n\nA jackal saw the lion running breathlessly. “Why are you running, Mr. Lion?\" asked the jackal. The lion told him all that had happened. “The bull has made a fool out of you,\" replied the jackal. And the jackal added, “Come with me. Together we can feast on the bull.\" But the lion was too scared to believe the jackal.\n\nThe jackal understood why the lion was hesitating to come with him. “Alright then! Tie your tail with mine and let me lead you to the cave of the bull. In case the bull attacks, then I will be the one who will get caught first,\" the jackal said.\n\nThe lion agreed to this plan of action prepared by the jackal. And then the lion and the jackal tied their tails together. They set off to the bull’s cave.\n\nBoth the lion and the jackal went near the cave where the bull was. When the bull saw the lion coming with the jackal, he thought, “I am sure that cunning jackal knows I fooled the lion. Without panicking, the bull cried out to the jackal, “I had asked you to being me two lions. Do you want me to keep my children hungry?\"\n\nEven this time the lion did not realize that the bull was again fooling him. He was terrified. He ran as fast as he could run dragging the jackal with him over stones and thorns. The clever bull outwitted his enemies and saved himself from its enemies.\n\nBoth the lion and the jackal never returned that way. Thereafter the bull lived a peaceful and happy life with his wife and children."

Though he had difficulty in arranging for fodder and grain for the calves, he managed to feed the two calves. Years passed by and the calves grew up into two bullocks.\n\nA thief had seen the bullocks. “The foolish Brahmin does not even know the proper use of these bullocks. I will steal the bullocks and sell them,\" he thought.\n\nThat evening, the thief started for the Brahmin’s house. While on his way, the thief was stopped by a fierce demon. “I am hungry. I will eat you,\" said the demon, in a thundering voice. “Wait! Wait, dear friend! I am a thief I am on my way to the Brahmin’s house to steal his bullocks. You can eat the Brahmin instead of me,\" said the thief.\n\nThe demon agreed. The thief and the demon proceeded towards the Brahmin’s house. Reaching the house of the Brahmin, the thief said, “Let me take the bullocks and go. Then you can eat the Brahmin.\"\n\n“No! Let me eat the Brahmin first. I am hungry,\" roared the demon. The two started to quarrel.\n\nThe noise woke up the Brahmin. As soon as he saw the demon, he started chanting some mantras. The demon uttered a sharp cry, “AAIEE!\" and disappeared.\n\nThen the Brahmin got hold of a thick stick, “You tried to steal my bullocks, did you?\" said the Brahmin. And he thrashed the thief. Thus the Brahmin saved himself from the demon and eventually punished the thief.\n\nThe Brahmin and His Enemies were separated from each other."

A saint, who happened to be passing by, saw the potter holding on to the donkey’s ears. Then the saint wanted to know what the problem of the potter was.

The saint said, “You tied up the donkey, but did you untie him?\" Go and pretend to untie the rope with which you had tied the donkey.\" The potter followed the saint’s advice.\n\nNow the donkey was ready to leave for home. The potter understood that donkey was the bonded donkey. The potter thanked the wise saint and went home happily with his donkey."

He would imitate everyone.\n\nThe hawk atop the hill would fly down everyday in search of food. The crow watched the hawk circling in the air for long hours and swooping down when he saw his prey. The hawk gifted with eyes that could see long distances would spot his prey from the hill top and then fly down to pounce upon the prey.\n\nThe crow watched the hawk thinking, “Hunh! If the hawk can do that, I too can. What does he think? One day, I will show the hawk that I can do the same thing.\"\n\nA few days later, as the hawk was circling in the air, the crow decided to do the same. Suddenly a baby rabbit came out of the bushes. The hawk saw it and the crow too saw the rabbit.\n\nBefore the crow could move, the hawk swooped down, caught hold of the rabbit in his strong sharp talons and flew away. “Swoosh!\" was all the crow heard as the hawk disappeared in the sky with his prey. “Hmmph! That is no great skill,\" thought the crow, angrily.\n\nNext moment he spotted a big fat mouse coming out of a hole. Without wasting time, the crow swooped down. Like the hawk he tried to catch the mouse in his claws.\n\nBut the mouse saw the crow and moved away, the crow crashed against the hill. “Eeeaaa!\" cried the crow in pain.\n\nJust then the hawk came flying down. “I hope, now you know it is not easy to hunt and it is not easy to imitate, either,\" said the hawk and flew away.\n\nThere after, the crow never imitated any one in its life. It lived happily with the god-given abilities."
