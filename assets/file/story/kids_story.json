He was not given any food nor any drink. He requested each and every passer\u00ADby to release him, promising that he would not kill his rescuer. But no one believed the ferocious animal.\n\nAt last, a kind traveller agreed to help the tiger, after the latter promised not to kill him. But as soon as the tiger was released, he wanted to kill the man. The man pleaded for life, reminding the animal of his promise. But the animal did not want to listen to his prayer. He said, \"I am hungry, and you are my prey. How I can let you go?\"\n\nMeanwhile, a fox happened to come there. He heard everything from both the parties, and said, \"I don't believe that such a big tiger could fit in that small cage.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Let me show how I was locked in the cage.\" So saying, he entered the cage. And the sly fox at once closed the door of the cage, and went away with the traveller."

      "body": "There is a legend of a woman who had a faithful dog. This dog was so faithful that the woman could leave her baby with it and go out to attend other matters. She always returned to find the child soundly asleep with the dog faithfully watching over him.\n\nOne day, something tragic happened.\n\nThe woman as usual, left the baby in the \"hands\" of this faithful dog and went out shopping. When she returned, she discovered a rather nasty scene. There was a total mess.\n\nThe baby's cot was dismantled. His nappies and clothes torn to shreds, with bloodstains all over the bedroom where she had left the child and the dog. Shocked, the woman wailed as she began looking for the baby.\n\nPresently, she saw the faithful dog emerging from the under the bed. It was covered with blood and licking its mouth as if it had just finished a delicious meal. The woman went berserk and assumed that the dog had devoured her baby. Without much thought, she clubbed the dog to death.\n\nBut as she continued searching for the \"remains\" of her child, she beheld another scene.\n\nClose to the bed was her baby who, although lying on the bare floor, was safe. And under the bed, the carcass of a jackal torn to pieces in what must have been a fierce battle between it and the dog which was now dead.\n\nThen reality hit the woman, who now began to understand what took place in her absence. The dog fought to protect the baby from the ravenous jackal. It was too late for her now to make amends because in her impatience and anger, she had killed the faithful dog.\n\nQuestion: How often have we misjudged people and torn them to shreds with harsh words and even with physical assault before we have had time to evaluate the situation? A little patience can drastically reduce major life long errors.\n\nThink about it!"
