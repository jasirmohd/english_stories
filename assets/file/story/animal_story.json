The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away.\n\nOn another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net.

The Town Mouse came and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.\n\nThe flavour was not much to the taste of the guest and presently he broke out with \"My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me and I promise you shall live on the fat of the land.\"\n\nSo when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.\n\nThe Country Mouse had never seen anything like it and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided. But before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again. But some one else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. \"Good bye,\" said he, \"I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace.\"\n\n"

Satyanand, Vidhyanand and Dharmanand were very knowledgeable. But Sivanand spent most of his time eating and sleeping. He was considered foolish by everyone.\n\nOnce famine struck the village. All the crops failed. Rivers and lakes started to dry up. The people of the villages started moving to other villages to save their lives.\n\n\"We also need to move to another place soon or else we will also die like many others,\" said Satyanand. They all agreed with him.\n\n\"But what about Sivanand?\" Asked Satyanand.\n\n\"Do we need him with us? He has no skills or learning. We cannot take him with us,\" replied Dharmanand. \"He will be a burden on us.\"\n\n\"How can we leave him behind? He grew up with us,\" said Vidhyanand. \"We will share what ever we earn equally among the four of us.\"\n\nThey all agreed to take Sivanand along with them.\n\nThey packed all necessary things and set out for a nearby town. On the way, they had to cross a forest.\n\nAs they were walking through the forest, they came across the bones of an animal. They became curious and stopped to take a closer look at the bones.\n\n\"Those are the bones of a lion,\" said Vidhyanand.\n\nThe others agreed.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity to test our learning,\" said Satyanand.\n\n\"I can put the bones together.\" So saying, he brought the bones together to form the skeleton of a lion.\n\n\"Dharmanand said, \"I can put muscles and tissue on it.\" Soon a lifeless lion lay before them.\n\n\"I can breathe life into that body.\" said Vidhyanand.\n\nBut before he could continue, Sivanand jumped up to stop him. \"No. Don't! If you put life into that lion, it will kill us all,\" he cried.\n\n\"Oh you coward! You can't stop me from testing my skills and learning,\" shouted an angry Vidhyanand. \"You are here with us only because I requested the others to let you come along.\"\n\n\"Then please let me climb that tree first,' said a frightened Sivanand running towards the nearest tree. Just as Sivanand pulled himself on to the tallest branch of the tree Vidhyanand brought life into the lion. Getting up with a deafening roar, the lion attacked and killed the three learned Brahmins.\n\n"

The heron sat at the water's edge looking depressed and thoughtful. In the same lake lived a crab who was friendly and thoughtful. As he went past, he noticed how the heron looked and asked him, \"Why are you looking depressed my friend?\"\n\n\"What can I say,\" said the heron in a sad voice. \"Something terrible is going to happen.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the crab anxiously.\n\n\"When I was on my way here this morning, I heard an astrologer say that there will be no rains in these parts for the next twelve years. The lake will dry up and we will all die. I am quite old. It does not matter if I die. But you all are so young. There is so much for you to see and enjoy,\" said the heron.\n\nThe crab went to the fishes in the lake and told them what the heron had told him. They were all filled with fear. \"O no! What do we do? We will all die.\" they cried.\n\n\"There is a very big lake some distance from here. I can take you all there one by one.\" offered the heron. All the fishes were comforted and they agreed to be carried to the bigger lake one by one.\n\nEvery day, the heron would fly the fishes one by one. He would hold one gingerly between his long beak and fly away. But instead of taking them to any lake, he would land on a rock some distance away and eat them. Then he would rest till evening and return to the lake.\n\nAfter some days, the crab went up to the heron. \"You have been taking the fishes to the other lake. When will you take me?\" he asked.\n\nThe heron thought to himself, \"I am tired of eating fish. Crab meat should be a pleasant change.\"\n\nThe heron agreed to take the crab to the other lake.\n\nBut the crab was too large for the heron to carry in his beak. So the crab climbed on to the heron's back and they started the journey. After a while, the crab grew impatient.\n\n\"How far is the lake?\" he asked the heron.\n\n\"You fool,\" laughed the heron. \"I am not taking you to any lake. I am going to dash you against those rocks and eat you like I ate all those fishes.\"\n\n\"I am not a fool to allow you to kill me,\" said the crab.\n\nHe held the heron's neck in his powerful claws and strangled the wicked heron to death.\n\n"

Think twice before going ahead with the plan.\"\n\nBut the crane was eager to try out the plan. The crane flew down to the river bank and began to fish. He caught several little fishes and went down to the hole in which a mongoose lived. He dropped a fish at the mouth of the hole. Then he took another fish and dropped it a little further away from the first one. Repeating this, he made a trail of fishes leading to the tree where his nest was.\n\nThe mongoose smelt the fish and came out of the hole. \"Ah, a fish!\" exclaimed the mongoose joyfully and quickly ate it up. He then followed the trail of fishes. As he neared the tree where the cranes and the snake lived, the trail ended. Finding no more fishes, he looked around.\n\nSuddenly he came across the black cobra at the foot of the tree. Seeing the mongoose, the cobra fought for his life. Both fought for a long time and in the end the mongoose killed the snake. The cranes who were watching the fight from their nest sighed with relief.\n\nThe next day the mongoose began to follow the same trail hoping to find more food. When he came to the tree where the trail ended, he decided to climb the tree in search of food.\n\nThe cranes who were away at the river bank returned to find the mongoose climbing down the tree. On looking in their nest, they discovered that this time, the mongoose had eaten up all their eggs.\n\n\"Alas! We got rid of one enemy only to find another,\" said the crane to his wife.\n\n"

      "body": "It was a bright spring day. The sun was high in the blue sky. A herd of sheep was grazing contentedly on the hillside. The little lambs with their soft white coats and curly tails were playing among themselves. The Shepherd, seeing that his flock was safe and happy, had fallen asleep under the spreading branches of a large old tree.\n\nSuddenly an Eagle swooped down from the sky. It pounced on a little lamb and carried it off so swiftly that none of the other lambs even had the time to bleat. The sleeping Shepherd heard nothing.\n\nA Crow was sitting on the tree under which the Shepherd lay asleep. He had seen how the Eagle had caught the lamb and carried it off to his nest.\n\n'What a wonderful way to get dinner!' he thought. 'Why do crows look for old smelly food?'\n\nThe Crow decided to do exactly as the Eagle had done. It had looked easy enough. All he had to do was to decide which sheep he wanted, swoop down upon it, hold it as firmly as he could in his claws and fly off with it... Easy!\n\nIf the Eagle could do it, then so could he!\n\nThe Crow looked down at the flock of sheep to decide which sheep he wanted.\n\nJust below the tree, by the Shepherd, a big, old Ram was grazing. He had curling horns and a thick heavy fleece.\n\n'Aha! He should be a good meal for me!' thought the Crow greedily. He was very hungry and the thought of a large juicy ram for lunch made his mouth water.\n\nThe Crow swooped silently and swiftly down onto the Ram, just as he had seen the Eagle do and grasped it firmly by its fleece.\n\n'And now to fly off with it to my nest,' said the Crow to himself. He flapped his wings with all his strength, but could not lift the Ram.\n\nThe Ram was large. He was much too heavy for the Crow to carry. The Crow tried again and again, but without success.\n\nThe Ram felt the Crow on its back and was most annoyed. Just what do you think you are doing, you pesky bird?' he snapped, glaring at him over his shoulder.\n\nThe Crow flapped harder still, trying to carry the Ram away.\n\n'Now stop that!' cried the Ram. 'Go away! Shoo! Leave me in peace!' He jumped and bucked and tried to shake the Crow off his back.\n\n'Oh oh!' thought the Crow, alarmed at the Ram's fierce antics. 'Maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all! Perhaps I should look for my dinner somewhere else! I had better let the Ram be!'\n\nThe Crow tried to fly away, but he found he could not move. His claws were caught in the Ram's thick fleece! The Crow pulled his feet this way and that. He flapped his wings as hard as he could. But no matter what he did, he only seemed to get stuck more firmly.\n\nOh, how was he ever going to get free? The Crow squawked loudly in fear and despair. The Ram started running around the tree, bellowing with rage. The Shepherd woke up with a start. Who was making that horrible noise? Were his sheep in danger? He sat up.\n\nWhat a sight met his eyes! The Ram was running round and round the tree. On his back was the Crow, squawking and trying to rise into the air.\n\nThe Shepherd began to laugh. At last, wiping his eyes, the Shepherd stood up. He stopped the Ram as he ran by and calmed him with gentle words.\n\nWhen the Ram was still, the Shepherd took a pair of shears from his sack. Holding the Crow with one hand, he deftly snipped the fleece until the Crow was free.\n\n'What did you think you were doing, my fine friend'' asked the Shepherd, looking at the Crow. 'Playing at being an Eagle, were you?'\n\nThe Shepherd burst out laughing again.\n\nThe Crow was too embarrassed even to croak. He wished only that the Shepherd would let him go so he could fly away to his nest and hide his foolish head.\n\nFinally, when the Shepherd let the Crow go, the Crow flapped his wings and flew off as fast as he could.\n\n'And the next time you want to be an Eagle, make sure you pick an animal your size!' called the Shepherd after him.\n\nThe Crow, feeling silly and foolish, promised himself that from now on he would only do as other crows did!\n\n"

But when the female crow laid her eggs, they were in for an unpleasant shock. A huge snake who lived in a hole at the bottom of the tree came up and ate all their beautiful eggs.\n\nThe crows were helpless with anger and pain. \"You can't let this wicked snake eat our children anymore,\" cried the female crow bitterly. \"You have to find a way to save them from him,' she said.\n\n\"Let us go to our friend the jackal. He is very clever. He will surely be able to help us with a solution,\" said the male crow.\n\nThey both flew to the cave in the forest where their friend the jackal lived.\n\nThe jackal saw them coming. \"Hello my friends. Why do you look so sad and worried? Can I help you in any way?\"he asked.\n\n\"Every time my wife lays eggs in our nest, a wicked snake living at the foot of the tree eats them up,\" explained the crow.\n\n\"We want to get rid of him and save our children. Please tell us what we can do.\"\n\nThe jackal thought for some time. \"I know what you should do,\" said the jackal and he told the plan to the crows.\n\nIt was a habit of the queen to come with her maids for a bath to the river. When they did so, they removed all their clothes and jewels and placed them on the river bank. On the following day the queen and her maids as usual entered the river.\n\n\"You know what to do right?\" asked the crow to his wife. \"Yes,\" she answered.\n\nBoth of them flew over the pile of clothes and jewels. The female crow swiftly picked up a precious pearl necklace in her beak. At the same time the male crow began to caw loudly to gain the attention of the queen and her maids.\n\n\"Oh, those crows have taken my pearl necklace.\" cried the queen. \"Guards!\" she cried. \"Get that necklace back from those pesky crows.\" Her guards chased the crows shouting loudly.\n\nThe crows flew straight to the banyan tree with the guards close behind. Hearing all the noise, the snake came out of his hole at the foot of the tree. Immediately, the female crow dropped the necklace right where the snake was.\n\n\"Look out! There is a huge snake near the necklace,\" alerted one guard.\n\nBefore the snake could realise what was happening, the guards attacked him with sharp spears and killed him. The guards then picked up the necklace and took it back to their queen.\n\nThe crows thanked their friend the jackal for helping them get rid of their enemy.

The peddler sold all sorts of goods....sturdy shoes for the farmers and pretty trinkets for their sweethearts, warm, woolly shawls to keep the women warm and sweet, sticky toffees for the children to munch on their way back from school.\n\nSome days he sold fruits and on other days, kettles. To carry all his wares, the peddler had a donkey. Every morning, the peddler loaded the donkey with his wares. The two would set out and walk from farmhouse to farmhouse, from village to village and from market to market.\n\nThe peddler always walked ahead, whistling merrily as he went. The poor donkey followed, trying as hard as he could to keep up with his master and groaning under the weight of his load.\n\nEvery evening, their wares sold, the peddler and his donkey would wend their way home. The peddler, pleased with the day's takings, would walk ahead, jingling the pennies in his pocket. The poor old donkey would follow, foot sore and weary from carrying the heavy sacks all day long.\n\n\"Ah! My poor feet! Oooh! My aching back!\" the donkey moaned every night as he collapsed wearily onto the hay in his stable.\n\nThe old grey cat who shared the stable with the donkey, would shake her head and sigh. 'Poor old donkey,' she would say to herself, and slink off into the night.\n\nOne morning, the peddler loaded the poor donkey with a dozen sacks. The sacks were full of salt and much heavier than the donkey's usual load. The donkey groaned under the weight, but bore it patiently, as he had always done.\n\n\"I shall make a tidy profit today on this salt.' said the peddler to the donkey, as they set off. 'There is not a woman who does not need to buy salt for her cooking and they will pay me well for this. I shall be a rich man tonight!'\n\nAnd the peddler danced a little jig in the middle of the road. The donkey could only think of the heavy load on his back and the long day ahead.\n\nThe donkey plodded along behind the peddler. The sun was now high in the sky. The donkey was hot and tired and longing for a drink of water. Up ahead, he knew, there flowed a stream of cool, sweet water. The donkey hurried towards the stream as fast as his tired legs and the heavy load on his back would allow and leaned over for a drink. The edge of the stream was slippery with mud and slush. The donkey, with the heavy sacks of salt on his back, slipped and fell into the water.\n\n\"Oooh, help! Help!' brayed the donkey in terror, his legs flailing madly in the water. 'I will surely drown with this terrible load on my back!'\n\nBut suddenly, the donkey felt himself floating, the load on his back gone as if by magic. He clambered out on to the bank and shook himself. Yes! The weight on his back had vanished!\n\nOf course the sacks were lighter, for the salt had dissolved in the water. But the donkey did not know that. 'At last! A way to rid myself of my burdens,' he thought and brayed with joy at his great discovery.\n\nThat night he told the grey cat all about how he had slipped and fallen into the stream and how, when he had climbed out, his load had become so much lighter.\n\n\"No more heavy loads for me,' declared the donkey, feeling very pleased.\n\n'Every time it gets too much for me, all I have to do is to pretend to fall into a stream and my load will lessen by magic!'\n\nThe grey cat shook her head and sighed. 'Poor old donkey.' she said and slunk off into the night.\n\nNext morning the peddler loaded the monkey again, this time with bales of cloth that he wanted to sell at the next village. Be careful today, old donkey,' he said as they set off. 'I did not earn penny yesterday. I must earn double today or we go to bed hungry tonight.'\n\nThe donkey plodded along behind the peddler and groaned under the weight of the cloth. His back ached more than ever and his feet were killing him. He resolved to find a stream as quickly as he could. As luck would have it, the peddler took the same path he had taken the previous day and very soon they came to the same stream. The donkey hurried ahead as though very thirsty and pretending to slip, fell in. He kicked his legs about, making sure the bundle on his back was properly soaked.\n\nIn a moment my burden will vanish.\" he told himself and kicked about some more.\n\nBut what was happening? Something was wrong! His load, in stead of becoming lighter, had become much heavier and was slowly pulling him deeper into the stream. Of course his burden was heavier, for the water had soaked into the bales of cloth. The poor donkey thrashed about in the water and brayed in terror.\n\n\"Help! Help!' he cried.\n\nMeanwhile, the peddler had rushed to the stream and bracing himself on the bank, helped the frightened donkey out of the water.\n\nThat night, the donkey was a sad and subdued creature. He had had to carry the much heavier, soaked and dripping bales of cloth all the way home again. His back was truly aching and what was worse, he had caught a cold. He sneezed miserably into the straw. The old grey cat looked at him and sighed. 'Poor old donkey,' he said and slunk off into the night.\n\n"

As both the boy and the mongoose grew up, their friendship changed to a relationship between two brothers.\n\nThe mongoose grew up fast and as days went by, the Brahmin's wife began to get doubts in her mind. \"After all, this is a wild animal. Sooner or later it will show its true colours,\" she thought to herself. She put the mongoose's bed separately and would watch him carefully when ever he played with her son.\n\nOne day when the Brahmin was away. Gowri decided to go to the river to fetch a pot of water. She looked around and saw her son sound asleep in his cradle. The mongoose was also asleep on the floor at the foot of the cradle. This should take only a few moments I hope I can trust that mongoose not to harm my little son,\" she said to herself and after a final look at them both she hurried down to the river.\n\nSuddenly, the mongoose woke up with a start. He had heard a very faint noise. Looking up, the mongoose saw a large black snake crawling in through a hole in the wall.\n\n\"The snake will harm my brother. Mother and father are away. I will have to protect my little brother,\" thought the mongoose, as the snake came slithering towards the cradle.\n\nThe brave little mongoose pounced on the huge black snake. After a long, ferocious fight, the little mongoose finally managed to kill the snake.\n\nJust then, he heard the Brahmin's wife returning. Joyfully, he ran out to meet his mother and tried telling her through his little animal signs that he had protected his little brother from a dreadful snake.\n\nBut as soon as Gowri saw blood on the mongoose's mouth and paws, she thought, \"This wretched animal has killed my little son.\" In a fit of anger the Brahmin's wife threw the pot full of water on the mongoose killing him instantly.\n\nEntering the house with a heavy heart, she was amazed to see her little son lying in his cradle still deep in sleep. On the floor was a huge black snake with its ugly head bitten off.\n\n\"Oh what have I done,\" cried the Brahmin's wife. \"I killed that faithful little mongoose who saved the life of my precious son.\"\n\n"

      "body": "The winter had been especially cold. The snow lay thick and heavy on the ground. The squirrels, the badgers and the hedgehogs had vanished into their snug winter homes to sleep away the cold, dark months. The swifts and the swallows had left for warmer countries long ago. Even the slugs and snails had disappeared, hiding away in some dark, warm patch of woodland to wait for the spring. The woods and fields were silent and empty. Only a big, black Crow was hunting for her evening meal.\n\nThe Crow had flown all day in search of food. But she had found nothing, not even a tiny mouse or a piece of someone's leftover lunch. Now she was tired and hungry. She cawed sadly.\n\n\"I will have to go without dinner tonight,' she thought as she flapped slowly across the sky in one last desperate search for something to eat.\n\nShe was on the point of turning back when she saw a thin column of smoke coming up into the sky, far away in the distance.\n\n\"Smoke means fire and fire means cooking and cooking means food!\" thought the Crow. She flew as fast as she could, towards the curling smoke. The smoke came from the chimney of a large farmhouse where the farmer's wife was cooking dinner for her family. A delicious-smelling stew was bubbling in a large pot over the fire and loaves of fresh-baked bread were on the table, ready to be cut into slices. A pat of butter and a chunk of cheese lay in their platters on the window sill. The farmer's wife had left the window open so the cold air would keep the butter from melting and the cheese from sweating.\n\nThe Crow saw the cheese by the open window. Quick as a flash, she flew down to the window sill, picked cheese in her big black beak and flew off. The farmer's wife was stirring the stew, with her back to the window. She did not see the Crow. The Crow was very pleased with herself. 'Nothing like a piece of cheese on a cold winter afternoon!' she thought.\n\nShe flew towards a clump of tall trees and perched comfortably on a bare branch high above the ground to enjoy her meal in comfort.\n\nA wily old Fox lay hidden among the bushes in the farmer's garden. He had roamed the woods and fields all day in search of food. But he had found nothing to eat, not a bird nor a mouse nor even the scraps from someone's picnic. Now he was tired and hungry.\n\n\"I will have to go without dinner tonight.' he sighed.\n\nHe was on the point of turning back, when he saw the Crow perch on the bare branch with the piece of cheese in her beak.\n\n\"What a lovely, smelly piece of cheese!' thought the Fox. I must have that piece of cheese for my dinner. Now, if only I can take that cheese away from the Crow...\"\n\nThe Fox watched the Crow settle herself comfortably on the branch. He smiled slyly to himself. Strolling up to the foot of the tree, the Fox called out.\n\n\"Good evening. Mrs. Crow! You look well today!'\n\nThe Crow looked down at the Fox in surprise. She had never heard him speak so politely before.\n\nThe Fox continued. 'Oh Mrs. Crow, how beautiful you are! Your feathers are so black! So smooth and shining! Truly. I have never seen such feathers before!'\n\nThe Crow was even more surprised. No one had ever called her beautiful before! Of course, she had always known how pretty she was. But it was pleasant to be admired by some one else.\n\nThe Fox looked up at her and sighed. 'How graceful you are. Mrs. Crow, how elegant! You fly so wonderfully well too and higher than an eagle!'\n\nThe Crow held herself taller. She had always known how graceful and elegant she was. Of course, she could fly most wonderfully high! How clever of the Fox to know that. She flapped her wings just a little bit so he could admire them again. What a charming creature he was!\n\nThe Fox took a deep breath and continued. 'Your claws, ahem, I mean your talons. Mrs. Crow! They are stronger than steel!'\n\nAh... her talons! She had always been proud of her talons. She hopped clumsily on the branch so that the Fox could take another look at her claws. Really, he did say the nicest things!\n\nThe Crow was by now quite sure that she was the prettiest, most graceful and the strongest bird of all.\n\nThe Fox smiled secretly to himself. He looked admiringly at the Crow and said. 'Dear Mrs. Crow. I have not heard your voice. It must be the sweetest voice in the world, as beautiful as you are. Dear Mrs. Crow, won't you sing for me?'\n\nThe Crow was flattered. All the other birds had told her that she had an awful voice. And here was the Fox begging her to sing for him! Of course, she had always known what a lovely voice she had...\n\nThe Crow took a deep breath and opened her beak in a loud and raucous Caw!' Down dropped the piece of cheese! The Fox snapped it up as it fell and swallowed it before the Crow realised what had happened.\n\nThe Fox walked off chuckling. 'Next time, Mrs. Crow, be careful what you believe!' he cried as he vanished through the trees.\n\nThe Crow was left feeling foolish. How could she have been so vain and so silly, as to be taken in by the Fox's clever words and to lose her lovely dinner!\n\nThe Crow ruffled her feathers sadly and got ready for a hungry night.\n\n"

      "body": "On a lily pad in the little stream that flowed at the bottom of the meadow, there lived an old Frog. He was a big frog and he was very proud of his size. All the other frogs were in awe of him and treated him with the greatest respect.\n\nSo did all the other creatures. The shining blue dragonflies that hovered over the stream during the day took great care to keep far out of the reach of his long sticky tongue. So did the little midges that fluttered by in a soft cloud in the evenings. Even the fishes in the stream were careful not to annoy him. The Frog ruled his watery kingdom unchallenged.\n\nThe Farmer who owned the meadow by the stream also had an old Ox. The Ox had worked hard for the Farmer all his life. He had helped him plough his fields. Yoked to an old wooden cart, he had carried his crops to market and his children to school. But now the Ox was growing old. He no longer had the strength to work as hard as he used to.\n\nThe Farmer was fond of his old Ox and grateful for all the hard work he had done over the years. He did not want to sell him. Instead, he decided to let the Ox spend his old age in peace, in the meadow by the stream.\n\nOne fine morning, the Ox moved into the meadow. He wandered around the meadow, surveying his new home. The grass was soft and green and wildflowers dotted the ground. The Ox was happy. He planned to spend his days grazing on the sweet juicy grass and basking in the sun.\n\nThe little creatures of the meadow stared at the Ox in fear and awe. The butterflies flew hurriedly out of his way. The hardworking ants and the busy bees stopped their work as the Ox walked slowly by. They had never seen any creature as big as the Ox. Not even the old Frog on the lily pad in the stream was quite this big! The Ox munched happily on the sweet grass. He did not even notice the tiny creatures.\n\nThe Frog heard the dragonflies chattering excitedly among themselves about the huge monster who had come to live in the meadow. The dragonflies had heard it from the bumblebee who had heard it from the ladybird who had heard it from the ants who had almost been trampled on by the monster as it stomped by.\n\n'It is the largest, biggest, most enormous creature you ever saw!' cried the dragonflies. It has huge curving horns on its head and a tail so long and so strong that one whisk of it is enough to blow us all away!\"\n\nThe Frog did not believe a word that the dragonflies said. 'Ha! This monster of yours cannot be bigger than I am!' he cried. 'And horns and a tail, bah! They cannot be more fearsome than my long sticky tongue!'\n\nHow could any creature be bigger than him? Was he not the largest, most magnificent frog in the world? The dragonflies were just being rude!\n\nThe Frog stuck out his long sticky tongue and would have caught at least a dozen of the dragonflies had they not dodged in time.\n\nJust then the Ox strolled down to the stream. He was thirsty and wanted a drink.\n\nThe dragonflies trembled in fear and rose up in a great shining cloud far above the reach of the Ox's curving horns and long tail.\n\nThe Ox drank his fill and walking away from the stream, settled down for a nap.\n\nThe old Frog on his lily pad saw the Ox and wondered what all the fuss was about. The terrible monster was nothing but a silly old Ox! And not a very large one either! When the Ox had walked away, he called out. 'Hey. dragonflies, was this your terrible monster?'\n\nThe dragonflies rustled their shining wings and replied. 'Yes, yes. Frog! Did you see how big he is?'\n\nThe Frog laughed scornfully. 'Big? You call that big? Why, I can be twice as big as that if I want to! Watch!\"\n\nAnd the Frog took a deep breath, huffed and puffed and swelled up like a balloon.\n\n'There! Am I not as big as him now?' he asked the watching dragonflies, speaking with a little difficulty.\n\n'Oh no. Frog, not yet!' cried the dragonflies. 'The monster is MUCH bigger. Look at him sleeping in the grass! He looks huge!'\n\n'Well, then. Watch me!' said the Frog. He took a deep breath, huffed and puffed and swelled up some more. 'I must be bigger than him now!' he gasped.\n\n'Ah no, Frog.' Cried the dragonflies.\n\n'The monster is MUCH bigger!'\n\nThe Frog was quite irritated with the dragonflies. His skin was feeling tight and stretched. It was difficult to sit As he felt he would roll over any moment and his cheeks were so puffed that his eyes were almost squeezed shut. He could barely see over his huge belly. He was sure he must be at least as big as the Ox by now! He decided to make one more attempt. He would show the dragonflies who was bigger!\n\n\"Watch me,' he squeaked with great difficulty.\n\nHe took as deep a breath as he could manage, huffed and puffed and swelled. He blew and he blew and he blew and he grew larger and larger and larger till suddenly.\n\nPOP!\n\nThe Frog had burst!\n\n"

      "body": "In a jungle there lived a pack of jackals. They would hunt together to eat from the left-overs of the lion's meal. One of the jackals was getting a little old. All the younger jackals bullied him and did not allow him to share the food.\n\n\"I have to do something to satisfy my hunger. Like this, I will not survive for very long,\" thought the jackal to himself.\n\nHe decided to leave his pack and go in search of food. He wandered around for many days but could not find any food. Everywhere he went, other animals chased him away.\n\nFinally he decided to venture into the village in search of food. After nightfall, the jackal walked down the village streets in search of food. Suddenly a pack of dogs began to chase the jackal. Scared for his life, the jackal ran as fast as his weak legs could carry him. Finding no way of escape, the jackal jumped into the first open house he found.\n\nSuddenly he found himself in a vat of foul smelling liquid. It was a vat of indigo dye. The house belonged to the village washer man. When the jackal climbed hurriedly out of the liquid and peered out fearfully, the dogs which were waiting for him outside, let out a howl and ran away with their tails tucked between their legs. The jackal was surprised. But finding the dogs gone, he carefully went back into the jungle.\n\nThe jackal went to the water hole in the jungle to quench his thirst. As the jackal went closer, all the other animals which had come there ran aw ay in panic. The jackal looked around in surprise to see what had frightened them. But he saw nothing wrong. He was very thirsty and so went to the water hole to quench his thirst. As he bent down to drink, he was shocked to see a strange looking creature in a brilliant and unearthly colour looking up at him from the water. The jackal was first frightened, but soon realised that he was looking at his own reflection. He remembered the foul smelling liquid into which he had fallen. \"So that is why all those dogs and all these animals in the forest were afraid!\" he reasoned to himself. His cunning mind thought of a plan quickly.\n\nHe called out to the frightened animals. \"Do not be afraid of me. I have been sent down by Brahma to protect you.\" The animals all believed him at once and made him king.\n\nAs the days went by, the jackal became prouder and lazier. He did not have to look for food any longer. His subjects would bring him food to cat and take care of every need of his. The jackal was very happy with his life.\n\nOne full moon night, the pack of jackals to whom the jackal had belonged before began to howl at the moon. The indigo jackal had not heard his brothers howl for a long time. The urge to howl was too strong for him to control. He threw back his head and began to howl to hisheart'scontent.\n\nThe other animals were astonished to hear their heaven sent king howl like a common jackal. And soon they realised their mistake.\n\n\"This is no extraordinary animal sent by Brahma. He howls like a jackal,\" said the bear. \"Yes. He is calling out to the other jackals.\" \"He has fooled us.\" \"He has to be punished,\" said several other animals. \"Come let's teach him a lesson.\" The animals joined together and gave the indigo jackal a severe beating.\n\n"

He often chased away younger jackals who would catch a prey and eat it himself.\n\nAll the other jackals were upset with him. They all got together and decided to get rid of Gomaya. None of them was as big as he, and could not challenge him individually. \"This is getting beyond control,\" said one jackal.\n\n\"We make all the effort and kill a prey and Gomaya comes and claims it.\"\n\n\"I have an idea,\" said another jackal.\n\n\"We will take turns catching prey. And while one of us has his food, the others together will keep Gomaya away. He is no match for all of us.\"\n\nThings became very difficult for Gomaya after that. He could no longer snatch food from the other jackals. They all attacked him together and chased him away. They would not even allow him to hunt in that part of the forest any more.\n\nGomaya wandered far away into another part of the forest. At last he came to the farthest part of the forest. By now, he had not eaten for many days. He was feeling very weak and tired. \"I have to find some food soon or else I will die,\" he thought. As he wandered around, he came to an abandoned battle field.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud and frightening noise. \"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\n\nGomaya was filled with fear and turned and ran away as fast as he could. After running a short distance, Gomaya stopped. He could still hear the sound. But it was not coming closer. \"I must be brave and find out what is causing that terrible sound,\" he decided. Gomaya slowly went back to the battle field. His heart was full of dread, but he decided to be brave.\n\nWhen he got there, Gomaya sighed with relief. The sound was being made by a harmless old war drum lying beside a tree in the abandoned battle field. Every time the wind blew, the lower branches of the tree would brush against the drum making a loud noise.\n\nGomaya was thrilled to find a lot of food lying near the war drum. He ate heartily till his stomach was full.\n\nWhat a fool I would have been if I had run away in fear and missed all this delicious food,\" thought the jackal.\n\n"

So they all joined together and went to meet the lion.\n\n\"O king of the forest, we have come to make a small request,\" they all said to the lion.\n\n\"Now what would that be?\" asked the amused lion.\n\n\"You are the king of the forest, but soon there will be no animals to rule over. So we beg you to stop this unreasonable killing and we promise that one of us will come to you everyday for your food,\" pleaded all the animals with the lion.\n\nSo from that day, the animals drew lots to decide on who was to go to the lion as his prey.\n\nOne day, the lots fell on the hare to visit the lion. All the animals consoled him and sent him on his way to meet his doom. But the hare was a clever animal. He did not want to die at the hands of the cruel lion. He saw an old well on the way. It was very deep and was a danger for all the animals. He thought of a plan.\n\nThe little hare went to sleep near the well all day. In the evening, he made his way to the lion's den. The lion was terribly hungry by then and when he saw a tiny hare coming towards him, he became furious.\n\n\"You little thing, how dare you come so late? How dare they send such a small animal? I will kill them all,\" the angry lion roared.\n\n\"It is not my fault, O mighty lion. There were three other hares with me. But on the way here, another lion attacked us. I just managed to escape. The other three hares were eaten by that lion,\"said the hare.\n\n\"What? Another lion in my jungle? Take me to him immediately,\" said the lion in a fit of rage.\n\nThe hare took the lion to the well and pointed it out to him from a distance. The other lion jumped out at us from inside the well when we tried to drink some water from the well. The lion rushed angrily to the well and peeped in.\n\nThere inside the well he could see another lion glaring at him. What the foolish lion did not realise in his anger was that he was looking at his reflection. He roared angrily at the other lion. He heard an answering roar.\n\nIt was only the echo of his own roar. But the lion thought that the other lion was challenging him. He jumped in and landed inside with a loud splash. And that was the end of the wicked lion.\n\n"

As he went from door to door, people gave him several things. Some gave dal. Others gave him rice and yet others gave him vegetables.

I will not have to beg for alms for a long time,\" thought the Brahmin to himself.\n\nHe went home and cooked his lunch.

I have given up eating flesh, ever since I met a friend who changed me from my old ways,\" said the lion.\n\n\"We would also like to meet your friend,\" said the crow.\n\nOn the following day, the wood cutter was as usual waiting for his friend the lion. Suddenly, he heard voices. The woodcutter was a very careful and clever man. He immediately climbed a tall tree. In the distance, he could see the lion approaching. With him were a crow and a jackal. \"With those two around, my friendship with the lion will not last very long,\" he said to himself.\n\nThe lion came over to the tree and called out to the woodcutter, \"Come down and join us. It is me your friend.\"\n\n\"That may be so,\" called out the woodcutter. \"But you have broken your promise to me. If those two can make you break a promise, then they can make you kill me also. You can forget our friendship.\"\n\n"

I will go to the next town and invest in another business,\" he thought to himself.\n\nSo he made arrangement for his departure. He took all he had and prepared to leave. There was an iron weighing balance which he could not take along with him. So he took it to his friend the money lender. \"Friend, I am going on business to the next town. Will you please keep this iron balance for me till I return?\" requested the merchant.\n\n\"Surely. Why not? May you prosper more than before and return,\" wished the money lender.\n\nThe merchant did very well in the next town and after a while had earned a good amount of money. He decided to go back to his home town. He returned home a rich man.\n\nHe went to his friend the money lender. \"Hello friend, I am back. Can you please return my iron weighing balance? I will need it to resume my business here.\" It was a good weighing balance and the money lender was a selfish man.\n\nSo he said, \"I am very sorry my friend. I kept your iron balance in my store room, but the rats ate it up.\"\n\nThe merchant knew that his friend the money lender was lying. He pretended to believe him and then asked, \"My friend, I want to take a bath in the river. Will you send your little son with me? I want him to keep an eye on my clothes and my money bag.\"\n\nThe money lender readily agreed and sent his little son along with the merchant. The merchant took the little boy and locked him up in a place in the outskirts of the town and went back to the money lender.\n\nHe said, \"I am very sorry my friend, while I was walking down to the river with your son, an eagle swooped down and carried him away.\"\n\n\"You are lying,\" shouted the money lender angrily. \"Return my son or I will take you to the judge.\"\n\n\"Come, let us go,\" said the merchant.\n\nHearing the merchant's story about the eagle, the judge said, \"Are you trying to fool me? How can an eagle fly away with a boy?\"\n\n\"If rats can eat an iron weighing balance, why can't an eagle fly away with a boy?\" asked the merchant.\n\n\"Explain yourself,\" ordered the confused judge. After listening to the whole story, the judge could not help smiling. He turned to the dishonest money lender and said, \"He paid you back with the same coin. Return his weighing balance to him and he will return your son to you.\"\n\n"

Everyday the owl would fly to the pond where the swan lived.\n\nOne day as usual, Kanakaksha flew to the pond to meet his friend. \"Good morning Sumitra, how are you today?\" he asked.\n\n\"Good morning my friend, I am fine. Just caught up with the usual work of a king - solving disputes among my subjects,\" replied Sumitra.\n\nJust then, one of Sumitra's subjects came up to him and whispered something in his ear.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Sumitra. \"Kanakaksha, please give me a moment. I have to settle another dispute between two of my subjects.\"\n\n\"Very well Sumitra,\" answered the owl. \"I will wait right here.\" After Sumitra left to find his subjects, Kanakaksha thought to himself, \"If Sumitra comes to know that I am just an ordinary owl, he will stop being my friend. I have to impress him.\"\n\nAs Kanakaksha was flying through the woods in search of food, he saw a camp of soldiers and their commander. He suddenly got an idea. He flew back to the pond and called Sumitra. \"I want you to visit my kingdom,\" invited the owl.\n\n\"One day I will surely visit your kingdom Kanakaksha,\" answered Sumitra the swan.\n\n\"Not someday,\" urged Kanakaksha. \"You should come today. I come to meet you everyday.\" Sumitra agreed and the owl took the swan to the place where the soldiers had camped.\n\n\"This is my kingdom and these are my subjects,\" said Kanakaksha to Sumitra proudly. Sumitra knew that Kanakaksha was no king. But he did not want to hurt his poor foolish friend's feelings.\n\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed Sumitra.\n\n\"Are your soldiers getting ready to move?\"\n\n\"No! How could they without my permission?\" The Owl flew over the camp hooting aloud \"Ho - hoo!\" The commander heard the owl and said, \"An owl is hooting. It's a bad omen. We will have to postpone our march.\"\n\nThe next day Kanakaksha and Sumitra came to the same place. Just as the army got ready to move. Kanakaksha hooted again. The army stopped again. On the third day again, Kanakaksha hooted just as the commander mounted his horse.\n\n\"Oh this omen maker! Will someone take care of him?\" shouted the commander angrily.\n\n\"This time my poor friend has gone too far,\" thought Sumitra the swan to himself.\n\nA soldier stepped forward and shot an arrow at the owl perched on a branch. But Kanakaksha spotted the arrow and swiftly flew away. Sumitra who had been next to Kanakaksha did not see the arrow coming. The arrow hit Sumitra and he died.\n\n\"Oh my foolishness has caused the death of my good friend,\" thought Kanakaksha bitterly to himself.\n\n"

I don't want to loose him.\"\n\nEven the queen spoke up. \"Do permit the snake. How many frogs can he eat anyway? We have many subjects.\"\n\nAt last the king had to grant permission.

Every one was excited to see such an amazing sight.\n\n\"It was my idea. I am the clever one. I need to let them know,\" thought the turtle.

They wound up the business and started back together to their own village. On the way back, they had to pass through a forest.

He lived with his wife in a cave at the bottom of the river.\n\nOne day Magar the crocodile came to the river bank to catch his prey. It was a hot and sunny day and Magar had not caught any thing the whole day. Tired and hot, he dragged himself to the shade of the berry tree for some rest. He had hardly closed his eyes when he heard somebody calling out to him. \"Hello friend. I am up here.\"\n\nMagar looked up to find Rhesa the monkey smiling down at him. The monkey plucked a handful of juicy berries and threw them down to Magar.\n\n\"Eat these. They will quench your thirst.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Magar and ate the delicious berries.\n\nFrom then on, everyday, Magar would come to the river's bank and eat the berries dropped by Rhesa. Both of them became good friends.\n\nOne day Magar took some berries home to his wife. She found them delicious. \"Mmm... If the berries are so tasty, how delicious would the monkey's heart be that ate these berries,\" she said. \"I want to eat the heart of this monkey.\"\n\n\"How can I do that?\" replied Magar.\n\n\"He is my friend.

I would have gladly given it to you. We will have to go back because I usually leave my heart back at home when I go out.\"\n\nThe foolish crocodile immediately turned around and swam back towards the bank.\n\nRhesa immediately jumped down from Magar's back and bounced up the berry tree. \"You are a fool Magar.

I wonder which pot of food will be ready first.’\n\nJust then, Anansi felt one of the lengths of web tug at his leg. ‘That must be the rabbit with his tasty dish of greens,’ thought the greedy spider.\n\nBut then another length of web tugged at another of Anansi’s legs. ‘Oh dear!’ he exclaimed out loud, ‘That must be the monkey with his pot of beans and honey.’\n\nThen another leg was tugged! And another! And another! Until all eight of Anansi’s legs were being pulled in different directions at once!\n\nAnansi dragged himself towards the river and jumped into the water so that all of his webs would be washed from his legs.

All eight of his legs had been stretched. Where once they were short and wide, now they were thin and long! ‘How could I have been so greedy?’ thought Anansi. ‘Now look at what has become of me. Not only do I have eight skinny legs, but now I must even cook my own dinner!’\n\nAnd that is why Anansi has eight skinny legs.\n\n"

      "body": "Haroon was a little boy who lived in a small village outside Karachi: the largest city and seaport of Pakistan. Haroon went to a small primary school in the village which was about a mile away from his house. His classroom was very spacious with long mats made of jute spread across the floor in straight lines. The children sat on these mats facing the blackboard and the teacher. There were no chairs or desks for the children, only one desk at the head of the room which was used by the teacher. There was also a cupboard to one side where the teacher kept the children’s exercise books. Apart from these few things, there was no other furniture. This was quite usual in a small village school in the old days.\n\nHaroon was a good boy who respected his elders, his parents, and his teachers. He would get up very early each morning in order to get ready, eat his breakfast, and start off on the long journey through the fields, arriving at the school well before time. He worked hard and always finished his schoolwork. And he always remembered his parent’s advice about never putting off today’s work until tomorrow.\n\nDuring break time, Haroon played Kabaddi in the playground with his friends. This is a popular sport among young people in the countryside and villages of Pakistan and Haroon enjoyed the game very much.\n\nThere was also a washerman named Taju who lived in Haroon’s neighbourhood. Taju owned a frail looking donkey, and every week he would ride that donkey to the nearest town and collect bundles of dirty clothes from the people who lived there. Then he would ride his donkey to the riverside where he would wash the clothes.\n\nTaju had a bad habit of hitting the poor donkey’s legs with a long stick whilst riding. The donkey would make a terrible wailing sound, ‘dei hoon, dei hoon!’ while carrying Taju and the heavy bundles of clothes. In the evening, Taju rode back home with the bundles of washed clothes, always hitting the poor donkey’s legs with his stick along the way.\n\nHaroon would often hear this terrible wailing sound as the washerman passed by, and the young boy could not sleep for worrying about the poor donkey.\n\nIn the mornings too, on his way to school, Haroon would see the washerman riding towards the town with his bundles of clean clothes, always hitting the poor donkey with the long stick. The young boy would often think long and hard about how to save the donkey from Taju’s beatings, but he could never come up with a plan.\n\nThis went on for a long time. The donkey grew old and frail. Taju also became old and frail like his donkey, and this meant that the washerman was not able to collect as many bundles of clothes from the town. It also meant that he became poorer still and found it harder and harder to look after his donkey. Taju started giving the donkey left-over food instead of fresh grass, and his habit of using the long stick did not change.\n\nAs it happened, Haroon passed his primary school final exam with the highest marks in his class. The headmaster presented him with a certificate along with a special prize. Haroon became very popular in the village and his parents were delighted and proud of their son. To celebrate his success and hard work, Haroon’s parents promised that they would buy him a gift of his own choosing.\n\nThat night, when the young boy went to his room to sleep, the window was open and he could hear the poor donkey wailing in the distance… ‘dei hoon, dei hoon!’ And so Haroon decided then and there that he would ask his father to buy Taju’s donkey from him. He was sure that his father would agree, but feared that the old washerman might say no.\n\nThe next day, when Haroon asked if he might buy Taju’s donkey, his father was very surprised at the unusual request. He said, ‘Son, what is so special about Taju’s donkey? You can have any animal you like as a pet.’\n\nBut Haroon said, ‘No father, I would prefer to have Taju’s donkey.’\n\nThen the young boy told his father the whole story about how Taju would hit his donkey with the long stick, how he made it carry heavy bundles of clothes and feed it only leftover food instead of fresh grass. Haroon explained to his father how he wanted to save the poor donkey from such cruelty. After hearing the story, Haroon’s father agreed to buy the old donkey for his son.\n\nAnd so, early the next morning, Haroon and his father went to see Taju and asked the washerman if they could buy his donkey.\n\nTaju was very surprised at this request. Then he thought about how old and frail his donkey had grown, and how difficult it had become to feed and take care of. And so, after haggling for a good price, Taju agreed to sell his old donkey to the father and son.\n\nHaroon and his father brought the donkey home with them and put it in the large courtyard at the back of their house. They also gave the old donkey fresh grass to eat and promised that it would no longer have to carry the bundles of heavy clothes or be hit with the long stick.\n\nHaroon always made sure to look after the donkey and soon it grew strong and healthy even though it was still quite old. The young boy was very pleased because he could see how happy the donkey was in its new home. And now Haroon would never have to hear the terrible wailing sounds, ever again.\n\n"

      "title": "The Tortoise and the Hare",
      "body": "Once upon a time, in the woods in the northern area of Pakistan, there lived many different kinds of animals. This area is famous for high mountains and very dense forests, and for hundreds of years these animals lived side by side as friends and helped one another in times of need and difficulty.\n\nSometimes the big bear liked to dance, and all of the animals would get together to see his magnificent performance. The Langoors (long tailed monkeys) would hang upside-down from the branches by their long tails. The elephants would use their long trunks to pick apples and peaches and apricots from the trees and share them among their friends. The snakes, with their beautifully patterned skin, would wrap themselves around the trunks and branches of the trees like brightly coloured banners. And the birds would sing beautiful songs while the hare used the shell of the tortoise to beat out a rhythm on his drum.\n\nOften, by popular request, the proud peacock would display his colourful tail feathers behind him in the shape of a huge fan and begin a graceful dance that would last for many hours. All of the animals would clap and cheer at this impressive display.\n\nOne day, after just such a performance by the bear and the peacock, the young hare became jealous that he was not being praised in such a way. He wanted to show all of the animals that he too could do something impressive. The fact that he was being ignored made the hare quite ill tempered. He even began teasing the tortoise. ‘How slow and almost dead you are,’ said the hare. ‘The only thing that you are useful for is as a stick for my drum.’\n\nThe tortoise did not like being teased in this way and said, ‘You are not being fair. I can do things too!’\n\n‘What things?’ replied the hare. ‘You are simply too slow to do anything. If there was a fire you would even be too slow to escape and so you would perish in the flames.’\n\nThe tortoise, always so patient and kind, did not like being ridiculed by the hare and was tired of his friend always bragging about how fast he could run. ‘I can escape from danger just as well as you,’ said the old tortoise. ‘I could even compete with you in a race,’ he announced.\n\nThe hare was astonished at such a challenge. ‘You!’ he exclaimed. ‘You would like to race with me?  Ha, Ha, Ha!’ The hare laughed so much that he fell off the rock that he was sitting on and collapsed onto the ground.\n\nWhen the hare finally dragged himself up from the ground, he looked at the tortoise once more with a smug grin on his face. ‘And I suppose you would win this race?’ he asked. ‘Are you sure you are not dreaming?’ And with that, he began laughing some more.\n\nThe tortoise was very annoyed with the conceited hare. ‘Who are you to make assumptions and doubt my determination?’ he asked.\n\n‘Ok, Ok,’ conceded the hare. ‘We will have a race!’\n\nAll of the animals had been listening to the tortoise and the hare and they all agreed that the race would take place the following morning at sunrise.\n\nThe following morning arrived and the tortoise made his way to the clearing in the forest where the race would begin.\n\nThe finish line was at the foot of the nearest hills where the wise owl sat watching over the racetrack with his yellow flag. He was the referee and his decision would be final. The chattering parrot was given the duty of announcing the start of the race, and the hare suggested that whoever lost the race would invite all of the animals to a tasty dinner. The tortoise agreed reluctantly. Now that he was actually going to have to race, he was not at all sure that he would be able to win against the speedy hare.\n\nBoth the hare and the tortoise stood at the start line with the other animals standing here and there along the sides of the racetrack. The parrot called out in his shrill voice: ‘On your marks, get ready, steady… one, two, three, go!’\n\nThe hare immediately skipped and hopped from the start line and in seconds reached a tree several metres away. He sat beneath the tree and looked back at the tortoise who had only managed to move a couple of inches from the starting line. ‘Oh, I can’t stand this pitiful sight,’ the hare said to himself. ‘I think I will go and pull out some carrots from the field and have my breakfast while I am waiting for the old tortoise to catch up.’\n\nAnd so the hare ran to the small field next to the clearing and pulled up some carrots. After munching several of the juicy carrots, the hare began to feel very sleepy. He yawned and looked over towards the racetrack in the clearing. The tortoise was so slow that he had not moved far from his original position. ‘What a silly old nutcase,’ the hare said contemptuously. ‘That tortoise is so slow that I think I will have a little sleep before continuing with the race.’\n\nAnd so the hare drifted off to sleep in the field. He was so sure he would win the race that he even began dreaming about his victory. He dreamt that all of the animals of the forest were standing along the sides of the racetrack cheering him along and waving their little flags as he flashed across the finish line with the old tortoise far behind.\n\nMeanwhile, the tortoise continued at his steady pace along the racetrack, eventually passing the lazy hare who was still sleeping in the field. ‘Have a good rest, hare,’ thought the patient tortoise. ‘I will see you at the finish line.’\n\nThe tortoise smiled to himself and carried on his slow and steady progress until he eventually crossed over the finish line to win the race!\n\nOnce the wise owl had declared the tortoise the winner, the old tortoise hid himself behind a small rock and waited for the hare to arrive.\n\nSometime later, the hare eventually woke from his sleep and immediately began the race again, assuming that the slow tortoise was still far behind. In no time at all, the hare zoomed across the finish and fell to the ground with a thud. ‘Hooray, hooray!’ exclaimed the hare. ‘I’ve won, I’ve won!’\n\nIt was then that the tortoise raised his head from behind the rock. ‘Not really,’ he said in his gentle voice. ‘I am afraid I have already won the race.’\n\n‘How did you get here?’ the hare asked in amazement.\n\n‘Just like you did,’ replied the tortoise. ‘I came along the racetrack as quickly as my old feet would carry me.’\n\n‘But you are very slow and I am very fast!’ exclaimed the hare.\n\n‘That may be, but I have won the race. Isn’t that right, Mr Wise Owl?’\n\n‘Yes indeed,’ said the owl. ‘You are the winner and the hare is the loser.’\n\n‘This is not fair!’ cried the hare, barely disguising the anger in his voice. ‘We should repeat the race and this time I will show you!’\n\nThe wise owl approached the hare. ‘This is your punishment for being so arrogant and always thinking that you are better than others,’ he said. ‘That was your first mistake.’\n\n‘But I was winning, you could see!’ exclaimed the hare. ‘If I had not gone to sleep along the way, this old tortoise would never have won the race!’\n\n‘And that was your second mistake,’ declared the wise owl. ‘You were irresponsible and you fell asleep before the job was done.’\n\n‘Well,’ said the hare, ‘I think the tortoise should be the one to cook for us all as he won the race and it is he who should be the host of the dinner, not me.’\n\nUpon hearing these words, the owl looked very sternly at the cheeky hare. ‘This is your third mistake, young hare. It was your idea that the loser should cook the meal, and now you are trying to get out of this commitment. I am the referee and this will not be tolerated.’\n\nAll of the animals agreed that the hare was being very cheeky in trying to get out of his promise. He had lost the race and he should be the one to cook the meal.\n\nWhen the wise owl pointed out that the hare had been arrogant and irresponsible, and was even now trying to break his promise, the young hare became so embarrassed that he lowered his eyes to the ground and used his long, floppy ears to cover his face.\n\nBut the wise owl insisted that the hare cook the meal and invite the tortoise and the parrot and all of the animals of the forest.\n\nThe hare reluctantly agreed to cook the meal, and it was during this long process of cooking that the hare learned his lesson. He told himself that he would never again be so lazy and conceited. And he would never, ever, underestimate the talents of his friends.\n\nThat night, the owl, the parrot, the tortoise, and all the other animals of the forest, enjoyed the wonderful meal that the hare had cooked for them. The friends talked and laughed and ate, and the hare even congratulated the tortoise on his victory in the race!\n\n"

      "body": "In the beginning of time, there was only one of each kind of animal so everyone was different. In the Sunderbans National Park in India, there lived a beautiful peacock called Pankaj. Pankaj’s feathers were of a greenish golden blue that sparkled and made everyone in the jungle adore him. His neck and eyes were also very gorgeous and everyone would praise his stunning looks. Pankaj enjoyed listening to all the animals telling him how amazing he was.\n\nHowever, Pankaj wasn’t modest nor did he compliment anyone else. He was vain and would look at his own feathers for hours on end. He believed that he was much better than all the other animals and acted arrogantly. The animals wouldn’t dare to say anything though as Pankaj had a very hot temper which was always on the verge of erupting!\n\nOne day, Maya Monkey had hurt herself and so all the animals attended to her and forgot to see Pankaj’s dance. ‘How dare you not come to see me dance? Just to help Maya! She is hideous – my dance is much more important! Apologise, all of you!’ Pankaj bellowed with steam hissing out of his ears.\n\n‘But Pankaj, she was hurt and we must look out for each other.’ said the animals.\n\n‘Oh, what do you know?! You’re all awful! Esha Elephant, you’re too fat and wrinkly! Chandni Crocodile, your skin is too rough! Gautam Giraffe, you’re too tall! And Lakshman Lion, your teeth are too sharp!’ Pankaj screamed. He went on and on, saying rude things about every animal in the jungle without remorse. He then strutted off crossly. The animals were very distraught about what Pankaj had said and decided not to talk to him.\n\npeacock in the rain\n\nThe next day, Pankaj went to talk to the other animals, but when no one would speak a word to him, he became frustrated and ran to the temple. ‘Why will no one talk to me, God? What have I done? Please help!’ he said. God then replied. ‘You insulted everyone in the jungle with such horrid remarks and now I must punish you.  I made every part of you beautiful because I thought you deserved it – but you obviously don’t. You and your descendants will now have ugly feet for the rest of your days!’\n\nHowever, Pankaj didn’t learn his lesson. Every day, when he was rude to the other animals, they reminded him of what could happen to him. Then Pankaj would say sorry. And the next day he would do exactly the same as the day before. And so this vicious cycle went on and on and on. Until one day, the animals had had enough of his rude manners. They decided to all go to the temple and ask God to punish him. As they walked to the temple, they raged with boiling fury and hatred! Finally, they arrived and summoned God.\n\n‘What is the matter now? I am busy today!’ said God.\n\n‘We demand that Pankaj be punished for his sins, My Lord. Even after giving him ugly feet he has not listened. Please take away something he truly loves. Make him stop being so insolent towards everyone!’ demanded the animals.\n\n‘Hold your horses! I shall make sure that he doesn’t bother any of you. He will not be allowed to dance except when it rains. He loves dancing but now he will only be allowed to do it in gloomy weather!’ God commanded.\n\n‘Thank you, for fulfilling our wishes.’ said the animals happily.\n\nAfter that, Pankaj had learned his lesson for good. And that’s why people say that peacocks have ugly feet and  dance when it rains!\n\n"

      "title": "Who is the Cleverest",
      "body": "A very long time ago, there was a crafty lion and a clever sheep. One day, the clever sheep was eating some grass in a clearing with his friend when the crafty lion came creeping across the fields towards them. When the lion came out of the tall grass the sheep prepared to run because they were scared of his sharp claws and his big teeth. ‘You do not need to run away,’ said the lion in a friendly voice. ‘I am simply here to tell you about a lovely fresh water lake just beyond these fields. Why don’t you come with me and have a drink.’\n\nThe clever sheep knew better than to trust the lion, but his friend was very thirsty and so agreed to go for a drink with the lion. The clever sheep warned his friend but the friend did not listen.\n\nAnd so the lion lured the sheep into the tall grass with the promise of fresh water. The lion looked all about to make sure that no other animals were around to help the sheep, and when he was sure they were alone he pounced on the unsuspecting animal, and ate him for his dinner.\n\nLater that day, when his friend did not return to the herd, the clever sheep was sure that the crafty lion had eaten him. ‘That is ten sheep this month,’ he thought to himself. ‘I must do something to stop the crafty lion before I lose all of my friends!’\n\nAnd so the clever sheep warned the rest of the herd about the crafty lion and his tricks. But the silly sheep did not listen, and as the weeks and months passed, the crafty lion lured more and more sheep into the tall grass with the promise of fresh water. And it was there that they met their grizzly end.\n\nOne day, the clever sheep decided that it was down to him to do something about the crafty lion and his wicked ways.\n\nThe sheep sets a trap for the lion\n\nThe clever sheep waited until nightfall and then crept out into the clearing next to the long grass. When he was sure that he was alone, he began to dig a very deep hole in the ground. When this was done, he built a huge fire at the bottom of the hole then covered the hole over with reeds and grass so that the smoke would be hidden from view.\n\nThe clever sheep waited patiently until dawn, and just as the sun was rising over the fields he heard a familiar voice coming from the tall grass.\n\n‘Why don’t you come with me, little sheep. I know of a fresh water lake just beyond the fields where you can enjoy a cool drink of water.’\n\nThe clever sheep did not move from his spot. Instead, the sheep said, ‘why don’t you come out of the tall grass and I will show you where you can find lots of sheep to eat.’\n\nThe lion was indeed very crafty, but he was also very greedy and could not resist the temptation of such a huge dinner.\n\n‘Come with me,’ said the sheep once more, ‘and I will show you where the herd lives.’\n\nAnd sure enough, the lion stepped out from the tall grass into the clearing. But as soon as he stepped from the grass, he fell down into the deep hole and burned in the roaring fire set by the clever sheep.\n\n‘That is the end of you and your wicked ways,’ thought the clever sheep to himself. ‘Now us sheep will be safe, for a while at least.’\n\nWhen the clever sheep returned home he told the rest of the herd about his victory over the lion. They all cheered and congratulated their friend, and they all asked how he was able to kill the crafty lion when the beast was so big and strong yet he was so small and fragile.\n\n‘It was simple,’ replied the clever sheep, ‘all I did was watch and learn from the mistakes of others.’\n\nThe clever sheep then went on to explain how he had watched the crafty lion lure his friends into the fields, and he also explained that this was how he had learned of the lion’s greedy nature.\n\nThe rest of the herd listened closely to the clever sheep and so they too learned never to trust the lions again, and they also learned how important is was to listen to good advice given by a friend.\n\n"

      "title": "The Lion with the Red Eyes",
      "body": "A very long time ago, there was a small village in Somalia in Eastern Africa. On the edge of the village there was rich farmland where the people grew their crops and tended to their sheep. The village was very beautiful but it could also be very dangerous, and it was sometimes hard to protect the crops and the sheep from neighbouring villagers or dangerous thieves. There was even talk about dragons that would come in the night and burn the crops and eat all of the sheep and goats.\n\nIn order to protect themselves from such dangers, the villagers raised lions from birth who later became guardians of the land. The lions were strong and proud and looked after the crops and the animals and kept the village safe. They were loyal to one another and would fight to the death if ever it was needed.\n\nBut one day, a lion cub was born who was different from the others. Unlike the rest of the pride, this lion was born with red eyes that glowed like fire. This made the other lions uncomfortable and so they named the strange cub Bahdoon which means one who is born away from his home. They named the little cub Bahdoon because they felt as if he did not belong with them in the village.\n\nLife was not easy for Bahdoon, he was treated badly and never invited to play with the other cubs. He grew up lonely and was always reminded that he was different. His red eyes singled him out from the rest of the pride and the mean cubs would often call him names and play tricks on him.\n\nEventually it was decided that Bahdoon should be banished from the pride, and so he was told to leave the village and never to return.\n\nPoor Bahdoon entered the jungle all by himself to start his new life of solitude. He was very sad, and often very lonely, but at least he was not surrounded by the other lions who always made fun of his red eyes and always reminded him that he was different.The lion with red eyes watches over the village\n\nThe years passed and Bahdoon grew into a big, strong lion. He was very good at hunting and made a life for himself in the jungle. But he was always lonely and would often walk to the edge of the jungle at night to look down upon his old village. He would admire the brave lions standing guard over the animals and the crops, and he wished with all his heart that he could join them and be accepted back into the pride.\n\nIt was on one such night that Bahdoon first saw the fierce dragon swoop out of the starless sky and attack the village, burning houses and crops with flames from its mouth, and snatching sheep from the ground with its sharp talons before disappearing into the night.\n\nThe lions tried their best to defend the village, but the dragon was too fast and too strong. Many of the lions were killed that first night as Bahdoon watched helplessly from the jungle.\n\nThe dragon attacked again the following night, and again and again, until the villagers were too afraid to come out of their homes. Many of the animals were now gone, and the lions had suffered greatly in trying to defend the village; most had been killed and the rest were very badly injured. The village would not survive many more attacks by the fierce dragon, and some of the villagers had even packed up their few belongings and fled into the jungle for safety.\n\nBy the fifth day, Bahdoon could not bear to see his old village suffer anymore, and so the brave lion swore to himself that he would defend its people and the pride no matter what they had done to him in the past.\n\nThat night, Bahdoon crept close to the village under cover of the tall trees that lined the edge of the jungle. He kept one eye on the night sky at all times and listened for the flapping of the dragon’s wings on the still air. He felt strong and determined, and he told himself that tonight he would destroy the fierce dragon and restore peace to his beloved village once more.\n\nSuddenly, Bahdoon heard the flapping of wings above. He looked up into the night sky and could see the silhouette of the fierce dragon swooping down towards the village: its long talons glowed silver white in the moonlight, its eyes scanned the ground for new prey, hungry and menacing.\n\nIt was then that Bahdoon summoned all of his strength, all of his bravery and determination. Just as the dragon swooped low above the village, Bahdoon charged out from the jungle and roared with all of his heart. The dragon was surprised and scared to see two flaming eyes come rushing out of the jungle, and the roar of the brave lion struck fear into its cold heart.\n\nBahdoon leapt up into the air and wrapped his strong paws around the dragon’s tail and pulled the beast to the ground. The brave lion and the fierce and evil dragon were locked in battle, but the dragon soon lost its strength when faced with such a skilled warrior.\n\nBahdoon was too strong and brave for the dragon who was not used to such an adversary. Bahdoon’s red eyes flashed in the night as he battled with the dragon, and soon the villagers came running out of their homes and began to cheer for Bahdoon which made the brave lion fight even harder.\n\nEventually, Bahdoon won the battle and killed the dragon. The few remaining lions also cheered for brave Bahdoon and all celebrated his victory over the beast. The village would be safe once more and those who had fled to the jungle might return to their homes at last and begin replanting their crops and raising new lambs and kids into sheep and goats so that they might once more have milk and cheese to eat.\n\nBahdoon was welcomed back into the pride and became the most celebrated warrior of the village. The lions were very sorry that they had sent him into the jungle, and they realised then that just because he was different it did not mean that he should be treated differently.\n\nAt last, the brave lion was accepted by the pride and for the first time in his life he felt like he belonged. Bahdoon had finally returned home.\n\n"

      "title": "Aharsi the Bengal Tiger",
      "body": "Aharsi the big Bengal Tiger was having a good think. It was winter and he was still getting used to the feeling of ice on the pads of his paws. He shivered a little, missing the warm ooze of mangrove mud. Aharsi was missing lots of things. He missed the way the sun made his coat glow a regal orange, or how the glare of midday brightness made his black stripes look so bold and striking like black lightening bolts. He missed dozing in the evening heat and catching the last shafts of sunlight as they cut through the jungle vines. He wondered if he would ever again hear Doyel birds chattering in the trees, or catch the scent of ripe mangoes on the breeze. It was these fleeting, poignant moments that the Bengal tiger was trying so hard to picture in his mind. Aharsi missed his home.\n\nHis whiskers bristled as he let out a big sigh, sending the starlings that had been pecking at the frozen ground scattering up into the grey sky. Three hours had passed, and despite his intense concentration, all the tiger had managed to remember was some vague half images of mangoes and mangroves. He was worried that he was forgetting about his old home all together.\n\nWhen Aharsi first arrived at the zoo in England with his mother and father, everything was so exciting. He lapped it all up; his amber eyes burned with curiosity as he jumped from tree to tree or smelled each flower or pawed at each tiny insect.\n\n‘Now just calm down, Aharsi,’ his mother would say. ‘You have come a long way. There is plenty of time to explore; now you must rest.’\n\nBut the young tiger was too busy to rest. There were new animals to meet, new trees to climb. There was so much to learn about his new home. Before the sun went down on that first day, Aharsi had bounded around all of the animals’ cages, asking them question after question, absorbing the strange exotic colours of the paradise birds and smelling the sweet and unfamiliar smell of the hay in the rhino stalls. But the more he explored, the more Aharsi realised how different his new home was to where he’d come from. And now the young tiger was worried that he’d lost all of the precious memories he had of his homeland. He was worried that he had forgotten all about being a Bengal Tiger.\n\nAharsi squeezed his eyes closed and flicked his tail purposefully from side to side: ‘Remember,’ he told himself. ‘Try to think harder!’\n\nHours passed, the day grew dimmer and the rest of the animals started to settle down in the twilight. After a while, Aharsi felt someone looking at him. He opened one eye, keen to stay as focused as he could on reclaiming his lost memories. It was Zody the Leopard.\n\n‘What are yoooouuu doing?’ came the deep, purring voice.\n\n‘I’m remembering,’ Aharsi answered. ‘Now if you don’t mind…’ Aharsi closed his eye once more and tried to concentrate even harder.\n\n‘Reeeemembering?’ asked Zody.\n\n‘Yes. I’ve forgotten all about being a Bengal Tiger, and where I’ve come from, so I’m trying to remember it before it’s all gone forever. Now if you don’t mind…’\n\nOnce again Aharsi squeezed his eyes shut and tried to summon images from his homeland.\n\n‘You won’t get faaaar with your eyes closed,’ said Zody.\n\nAharsi opened his eyes wide and looked quite annoyed. ‘I won’t get anywhere unless you leave me alone to think!’ he said. ‘You wouldn’t understand anyway, you’re not even a tiger, let alone a Bengal Tiger! You’re a leopard!’\n\n‘You silly animal!’ said Zody, rattling with laughter. ‘Look there!’ She pointed to a shiny slick patch of ice on the hard ground.\n\nAharsi stared back at Zody in some confusion. ‘I think you may have gone a bit bonkers, Zody,’ he said, and just then he almost wanted to laugh himself.\n\n‘If you want to remember how to be a tiger,’ said Zody in a kind voice ‘just look.’\n\n‘Fine, if you’ll leave me alone then I’ll look.’\n\nAharsi bent his neck a little and peered into the glassy ice mirror on the ground. Zody purred over his shoulder.\n\nAharsi looks into the ice‘What beautiful stripes you have,’ she said. ‘When I look into the mirror I see my spots. Nobody else has spots quite like mine. My mother had spots, and my mother’s mother, and my mother’s mother’s mother… all the way back to when my great great great Grandma prowled the grasses of South Africa!’\n\nAharsi noticed Zody’s eyes get brighter as she pictured the sun baked savanna and plush green jungles of her home. ‘When I see my spots,’ she continued, ‘I see my whole history. And I will always have my spots.’ She winked at Aharsi. ‘After all,’ she said, ‘a leopard never changes its spots!’\n\n‘But don’t you ever get homesick or sad?’ the young tiger asked in a slight mewl. ‘Everything is so different here.’\n\n‘We all get homesick,’ Zody replied while pawing at the ice, ‘but look here at our reflections. We are not so very different. You are from Bengal and I am from Africa, but see how we have the same whiskers. And see here…’ Zody cut an impressive jagged line in the ice with her sharp claws and then raised them up so that they shone in the fading light. ‘We both have these,’ she said with a grin.\n\nJust then there was a great trumpeting sound from the elephant’s enclosure in the east corner of the zoo.\n\n‘Well that’s not so amazing,’ said Aharsi. ‘We are both cats. But I’m nothing like the elephants over there, am I?’\n\nZody giggled. ‘They might look different and sound different, but I’ll bet even elephants get homesick too. That is something you have in common.’\n\nAharsi looked unsure as he thought that the elephants were far too big and strong to ever be sad. ‘I bet they still remember where they are from,’ he said. ‘My mother told me that an Elephant never forgets.’\n\nZody hissed and giggled and rolled around on the hard ground. ‘That’s true!’ she admitted. ‘An elephant never forgets!’\n\n‘And I bet the Zebras don’t get scared,’ Aharsi continued, still a little bit sulky but starting to smile at his friend’s antics.\n\n‘Haven’t you seen them running from the zookeeper’s tractor?’ asked Zody\n\n‘And… and the crocodiles? Do they get scared and sad too?’ Aharsi asked.\n\n‘Haven’t you seen them hiding beneath the water?’ Zody replied as she gave her friend a playful bump with her nose. ‘We all miss home sometimes, Aharsi. But that is why we all look different. We are different so that we can remember. Look at me. I have this beautiful tail which reminds me that we leopards are the best at balancing up high in the trees.’\n\nAharsi felt much better and soon began to rumble with a deep purr. ‘And I will always have my stripes for hiding in the tall grass. We tigers are the best hunters in all of Bengal!’\n\n‘Your stripes go wherever you go, Aharsi,’ Zody said with a smile.\n\n‘And when the elephants feel sad they can look at their trunks to remember that they are the best at splashing in the water,’ said Aharsi. ‘And when the crocodiles feel sad or scared they can look at their webbed feet and remember that they are the fastest in the river…’\n\nThe young tiger trailed off a little, his eyes were growing heavy and he yawned without noticing. It was evening now and the zoo was alive with the crooning calls of countless animals. Some were stripey, some were spotty. Not any one of them was the same as the other. As night fell and a million stars filled the sky, Aharsi began to understand that though all of the animals were different, they all felt the same sometimes. That is when he knew he would never be alone, and that is when he knew he would always carry his home in his heart forever.\n\n"

      "body": "Once upon a time in a little house on the edge of the woods a girl called Goldilocks lived with her parents.  One morning she woke up as the sun was streaming through her window; thinking it was time for school, she leapt out of bed.\n\nGoldilocks pesters mumDownstairs her mother was busy “It’s far too early for school; don’t get under my feet. Why don’t you go out for a walk? You can pick me some blackberries to make a pie for dinner tonight” she grumbled.\n\nGoldilocks went skipping into the woods swinging a basket for the blackberries.  Singing to herself, she went further and further into the woods.\n\nAfter a while she began to feel hungry and a little bit tired.  Across a clearing in the woods she suddenly saw a cottage, “Perhaps I could get something to eat there and have a rest” she thought.\n\nShe knocked on the door but there was no reply.  Gently she pushed the door and, to her surprise, it opened.  Cautiously she went in.  “Hello” she called, but there was no reply.\n\nThe door had opened into a kitchen and she could see on the table three bowls from which came the most delicious smell that made her tummy rumble.  The bowls were 3 different sizes, big, middle sized and little, and by each bowl was a chair also big, middle-sized and little.  Goldilocks scrambled onto the biggest chair because it had the biggest bowl of porridge by it.  She picked up a big spoon and tried the porridge “Ouch” she cried for it was very very hot.\n\nShe moved onto the next chair and the next bowl.  Picking up a middle sized spoon she tried the porridge.  “Yuck” she said, for it was very very cold.\n\nShe moved onto the next chair and the smallest bowl.  Picking up the smallest spoon she tried the porridge.  It was perfect.  So, very quickly, she ate it all up.  As she was finishing it she began to hear a strange creaking sound and, just as she ate the last spoonful, the legs of the chair she was sitting on broke and she landed with a bump on the floor.\n\nAfter all the porridge and the bump she felt very sleepy.  So she went up the stairs to see if she could find somewhere to lie down.  First of all she found a great big bed, she climbed up onto it but, oh, it was so hard.\n\nThen she found a middle-sized bed, she climb into it but it was so soft she felt as though she would disappear in it.\n\nThen she found a little bed.  It felt just right so she climbed right into it, pulled the covers over herself and was soon fast asleep.\n\nThe three bearsJust after she fell asleep the owners of the cottage came back.   They were 3 bears, Daddy Bear, Mummy Bear and Baby Bear.  They’d been for a walk in the woods before breakfast and now they were hungry.\n\n“Hello, what’s this” growled Daddy Bear, “it looks as though someone’s been messing with my porridge and whoever it is has left muddy footprints on my chair”.\n\nMummy Bear came to look “You’re right, my dear” she said in her soft growl “someone’s been messing with my porridge too, and I’m sure the cushion on my chair has been sat on”.\n\nThen Baby Bear began to cry  “Someone’s been messing with my porridge and they’ve eaten it all up and they’ve broken my chair as well” he sobbed in his little, squeaky, growl.\n\nWho could have done this? And where were they now? they wondered.\n\nThey looked around the house and went upstairs.\n\n“Well” growled Daddy Bear “Someone’s been in my bed, but they’re not there now”\n\n“Someone’s been in my bed too” said Mummy Bear “but I can’t find them”\n\nThen they heard a squeak from Baby Bear “Daddy, Mummy, come quickly, there’s someone fast asleep in my bed”\n\nDaddy and Mummy Bear raced into his room and stood around the bed with him looking down at Goldilocks.  She woke with a start and was frightened to see three bears all looking down at her.  Before they could talk to her, she jumped out of bed, out of the window and ran away through the woods back to her home because she didn’t know that they were really gentle, friendly bears.\n\n“Well I never” growled Daddy Bear scratching his head “my Grandfather told me people were strange.  Fancy, eating all that porridge and then running away”.  Puzzled, the three bears went back to the kitchen where Daddy Bear mended Baby Bear’s chair while Mummy Bear made more porridge, and from that day to this bears all over the world have always known that people are strange things who are not to be trusted with porridge.\n\n"

      "body": "This is the story of a little girl who was not scared of anything… well, at least until she grew a bit older.\n\nThe little girl lived with her mother and father and her older brother whom she loved very much. The family lived in a pretty town: not too small and not too big. Not too posh and yet quite chic. This little town was situated in the North-West of Poland.\n\nMost towns are much too inviting to be inhabited only by humans. And this town was no exception. In fact, almost anywhere you go, if you are very quiet and look very closely, you will soon see numerous creatures with which we share our towns and cities.\n\nAll about you are foxes, squirrels, mice, rats, blackbirds, pigeons, sparrows, and sometimes even tortoises and parrots who have escaped from their homes to roam the streets and rooftops.\n\nThe little girl and her brother loved all animals – those they could see in their little town, and those that lived very far away in jungles and deserts across the globe.\n\nLearning with brotherThe children found it fascinating to learn about animals and they would often play games, testing each other to see who knew the most animal facts. The brother often won these games but the little girl, eager to be as clever as her older brother, was definitely catching up.\n\n‘How quickly can the hare run?’ the brother would ask.\n\n‘I’ll tell you how quickly a hare can run, if you can tell me what is the most poisonous snake on the whole planet?’ the little girl would reply.\n\nAlthough the little girl looked up to her older brother, it was perhaps not such a good idea to idealise him so. Even though the brother loved almost all animals, he had always been scared of mice. Because of this, the little girl noticed that she too was scared of mice without ever really knowing why. She did not understand it at the time, but it is quite possible to learn how to be scared of things by watching others.\n\nOne year, when summer arrived in their little town, the brother was finally old enough to be allowed to go camping with his friends. And so the little girl was sent to visit her grandma and grandpa who lived in the countryside.\n\nThe little girl loved walking across the fields with her grandma and naming all of the different plants. She also loved swimming in the lake with her grandpa while trying to catch the small fish in her hands. But what she liked the most was going on long walks in the forest with both of them.\n\nDuring these walks they looked for the first tiny mushrooms that would sprout from the earth after the rains. The little girl also picked raspberries and rose berries so her grandma could make jams for the winter.\n\nWhen they returned home, the little girl would thread slices of cut mushrooms on a thin piece of string, turning them into splendid garlands which she would then hang around her neck.\n\nWhile grandpa prepared fish for dinner, the little girl and her grandma would laugh and play. They imagined how funny it would be to decorate a Christmas tree with row upon row of mushroom garlands.\n\nOccasionally, as they walked through the forest, the grandparents and the little girl would catch sight of a deer, or even an owl: sleepy after a long night of hunting. This did not happen very often because you have to be very quiet to spot such creatures and the little girl spent much of her time singing with her grandma, or swapping stories in a secret language which they had learned over the years.\n\nIt is very difficult to be so quiet when you are having so much fun with your grandma!\n\nNow you might better be able to imagine what a surprise the grandma got when the little girl screamed out in fear from the kitchen one day.\n\nThe old woman hurried after the little girl thinking that there must have been an accident. But when she got to the kitchen, the little girl was not injured at all. Instead, she was standing on top of the dining table looking quite scared and pointing towards a broom in the corner.\n\n‘What is it?’ asked the grandma.\n\n‘I saw a mouse!’ cried the little girl.\n\nThe grandma chuckled and asked: ‘Does the mouse have big teeth and flaming red eyes and huge, razor sharp claws with which to attack you?’\n\n‘No,’ said the little girl, ‘it is just a small, fluffy mouse… the normal kind.’\n\nThe grandma continued chuckling to herself and soon the little girl could not help joining in. As the old lady helped her granddaughter down from the table, she asked: ‘What happened to my fearless little girl who loves all animals and is curious about everything? That little girl would never be scared of a mouse.’\n\nThe little girl thought about the question for a while and then replied: ‘Each time my brother sees a mouse or a rat he is really scared. If he is scared of mice then they must be really horrible because he is very brave.  Because he is scared, I am scared.’\n\n‘But are you actually scared,’ asked the grandma, ‘or is it just that you have gotten used to acting scared when you see a mouse. After all,’ she continued, ‘a mouse is no bigger than your hand.’\n\nThe little girl thought some more, then she said: ‘Not actually scared I suppose. I don’t really know.’\n\nThe grandma took a seat at the table and the little girl climbed up onto her lap.\n\n‘A lot of people are scared of silly little things without having a reason for it,’ said the old woman. ‘I don’t want you to be one of those people. These quirky habits of being scared can become a real nuisance when you get older. If you are not careful you will be scared of getting wine from your cellar just because there might be a little mouse down there. Or you might become scared of your own garden just because a few rats may have crossed it during the night. Or you might even become scared of a person because they look different from you or come from another country.\n\nIt makes no sense to be scared of such things without a very good reason.\n\n‘Also,’ the grandma continued in her soft voice, ‘don’t you think it is funny that you are not scared of the forest or the lake, but you are scared of a little mouse?’\n\n‘I know,’ said the little girl with just a touch of hesitation in her voice, ‘but I just can’t help it. Each time I see a mouse I want to scream. I don’t like the way they look or the way they move.’\n\nThe grandma smiled and said: ‘Oh, that’s not very nice. It’s not their fault that they move in such a way. And they cannot change the way they look, can they?\n\n‘I know that once you have your mind set against something it is difficult to change it, but you might try to focus on what it is you like about mice, and what it is you admire about them. If you do that then the scary things will become smaller and smaller and soon they will disappear altogether.’\n\nThe little girl was not completely convinced, so she asked: ‘Grandma, please tell me why you like mice so much? What is that you see in them?’\n\nThe grandma reached across the table for her teapot and poured herself a cup of tea. ‘Well now,’ she said, ‘I think I have just the story for you.\n\n‘Remember I told you that when I was just a little older than you are now there was a war in our country?’\n\nThe little girl nodded but remained silent so as best to concentrate on the story.\n\nThe grandma continued: ‘It was very dangerous for children to play out on the streets back then because the soldiers of the occupying army could be extremely short tempered and would hit us children if we irritated them or made too much noise. There was never enough food to share between me and my parents and my siblings and times were very hard.\n\n‘Watching mice was fun and helped me to forget about my troubles. And it turned out that mice were excellent teachers. They showed me how to walk quietly and remain unnoticed. Thanks to that little trick I was able to visit my friends who lived across the street and gossip with them about boys.’\n\nThe little girl looked up and noticed a cheeky smile appear on her grandma’s lips. When she saw the little girl looking up at her, the grandma reached for her tea and took a sip and pretended that she was not smiling at all.\n\n‘Something else they taught me to do,’ said the grandma, ‘was to respond quickly to any changes. You see how rapidly a mouse can react to any movement and hide in its hole or disappear in the tall grass? By watching mice I learned how to quickly hide from soldiers and avoid problems. They also showed me how to outwit the soldiers and sneak under their noses to get more food.\n\n‘If we followed the mice we would always find some extra grains from which we could bake bread. Who knows,’ beamed the old lady, ‘maybe it is thanks to mice that I survived the war.’\n\nThe little girl was mesmerised, all the time trying to imagine her grandma as a young girl gossiping about boys, or sneaking about under the noses of the soldiers to find food. And all this she had learned from watching mice!\n\n‘Perhaps,’ pondered the little girl, ‘mice are not truly so bad after all.’\n\nJust then, as if sensing the little girl’s change of heart, the mouse that had scared her only moments before, popped its head out from behind the broom in the corner of the kitchen.\n\nThe little girl watched it sniffing the air, its whiskers twitching all the time, its little tail curled up behind it like a question mark.\n\n‘There must be some truth in my grandma’s way of dealing with scary things,’ thought the little girl. ‘After all, my grandma isn’t scared of anything!’\n\nSuddenly the mouse scampered across the floor and disappeared through the kitchen door and out into the garden. As she watched the mouse disappear, the little girl promised herself that she would think about mice in a more kindly way. And when she got home she would share the story with her brother so that he too would see that mice were really very clever creatures and not scary at all once you got to know them.\n\n"

      "body": "There was once a wealthy farmer who kept a stable of many donkeys. The farmer was very proud of his donkeys, and all day long they helped him work on his land by pulling the plough through the fields, or by pulling the cart to market when it was time to sell his crops.\n\nThe farmer also had a dog whom he loved very much and relied upon to protect his land and his donkeys during the night.\n\nOne day, the farmer returned home after a hard day in the fields and was so tired that he went straight to bed without feeding his dog. The dog was extremely hurt by his master’s forgetfulness and said to the donkey, ‘What shall I do without food now that my master has forgotten to feed me? It is fine for you donkeys who get to eat grass all day long, but I am starving and do not know how I will make it all the way through the night without food.’\n\n‘I am sure our master will come down and feed you very soon,’ replied the gentle donkey.\n\nAnd so the dog waited, and waited, and waited, but the farmer did not come down to the stable to feed him.\n\nThe dog was very upset indeed. He tried to go to sleep but his empty belly kept rumbling and did not allow him to fall asleep.\n\nSometime during the night, the donkey noticed the shadowy figure of a thief sneaking across the fields towards the farm. ‘Hey,’ called out the donkey to the dog who was curled up on the stable floor, ‘you must start barking as loudly as you can so that our master will wake up and see that there is a thief coming to take all of us donkeys!’\n\nThe dog said in a most indignant voice, ‘I am not having any of that. Why should I wake up my master after he has forgotten to feed me? If he does not care about me, why should I care about him?’\n\nThe donkey pleaded and pleaded with the dog, but it was no use at all, the dog would not be persuaded to bark out a warning to the farmer.\n\nThe donkey grew very nervous and began to kick and jump about, and at the top of his voice he began to bray… ‘Hee-haw! Hee-haw!’\n\nWhen they heard this commotion, the other donkeys all joined in with the warning: all kicking and jumping and making loud braying noises… ‘Hee-haw! Hee-haw!’\n\nSoon there was such a noise that the farmer jumped out of bed and ran down to the stable to investigate.\n\nThat was when he spotted the thief approaching the stable and chased him across the field away from the farm. ‘Get away from here you thief!’ shouted the farmer as the shadowy figure disappeared into the darkness.\n\nAnd so that was how the donkey protected his friends from the thief who came in the night. But the farmer also realised something very important that night. He had noticed that his loyal dog had not barked out a warning, and he remembered that he had not fed the dog and so had caused the animal to become very upset.\n\nMan's best friendThe farmer went straight to the farmhouse and soon returned with a big bowl of food for his loyal friend. He promised the dog that he would always remember to feed him and look after him because he now realised that such care to one’s animals was always rewarded with loyalty and protection. ‘We must look after our animals as we look after our children,’ thought the farmer as he patted his loyal dog on the head and returned to the farm for a good night’s sleep, safe in the knowledge that his loyal dog would protect the farm during the night.\n\n"

      "title": "The Princess and the Golden Ball",
      "body": "Once there was a beautiful princess who lived with her father in a huge palace. Although the princess was very beautiful she was also very selfish and conceited. The princess always got her own way and the king was often disappointed with his daughter. He was worried that she would grow into a selfish woman and that she would not be a good example to his people.\n\nOne day the princess was playing in the gardens of the palace. She was playing with her favourite possession in the whole world, a golden ball. The princess loved the golden ball because it was so shiny and she could see her reflection upon its surface. She also loved the ball because it was so valuable.\n\nThe princess threw the ball high into the air where the sun made it sparkle against the blue sky. Higher and higher she threw the golden ball. So high that she imagined the golden ball was a second sun; a sun belonging to her and her alone.\n\nThe golden ball went so high up into the air that it really did begin to look like a sun, and the reflections dazzled the princess who had to close her eyes. The ball landed some way away and began to roll towards the lake in the shadows of the giant Nakla trees.\n\nThe princess let out a cry and ran towards the golden ball with her arms outstretched. But she was too late. The ball rolled into the lake and sank beneath the surface out of sight. The princess collapsed onto the ground and began to cry. She cried to hard that her tears fell into the lake making a sound like raindrops. Little ripples stretched across the surface of the lake and still the princess cried and cried.\n\nThen a small voice came out of nowhere. ‘Why are you crying, princess?’ The princess looked all around but she could not see a single person near the lake. Again the small voice asked, ‘why are you crying, my princess?’\n\nWhen she looked down she saw a small frog sitting on the edge of the lake with wide eyes and little webbed feet.\n\n‘I have lost my golden ball and now I will never get it back.’\n\n‘Where have you lost it, princess?’ said the little frog. ‘I can help you find it if it will stop your tears.’\n\nThe princess wiped her tears away. Perhaps this little frog can help me, she thought.\n\n‘It is at the bottom of the lake where I cannot reach.’\n\nFrogThe little frog looked at the princess and smiled. ‘I can fetch it for you, princess. I will dive to the bottom of the lake and I will bring back your golden ball for you.’\n\nThe princess was delighted by the news and also smiled, but before the frog jumped into the water her wanted the princess to make him a promise.\n\n‘I will promise you anything if you will bring me back my golden ball,’ said the princess.\n\n‘I want you to take me with you back to the palace and be my friend. If you promise to do this then I will dive to the bottom of the lake and find your golden ball.’\n\nThe princess agreed right away and so the little frog jumped into the lake and swam all the way to the bottom where he took the golden ball in his mouth. The ball was very heavy and the little frog struggled to get back to the surface. Eventually he appeared on the edge of the lake and dropped the ball onto the grass at the princesses’ feet.\n\nThe princess took the ball and held it to her chest and laughed with glee. Then she ran towards the palace, leaving the frog behind.\n\n‘Wait for me,’ cried the little frog. ‘You promised to take me with you!’\n\nBut the princess ignored the frog, forgetting all about her promise. All she could think about was how happy she was that she had her golden ball. And she knew it would be dinner time at the palace and she was hungry. The princess only ever thought about herself and the poor frog was left alone on the edge of the lake.\n\nLater that evening the princess and the king were sitting down to dinner in the palace. The princess did not spare a thought for the frog, or for the promise she had made him.\n\nThen there was a knock at the palace door. A moment later the frog hopped into the dining hall and jumped up on to the table next to the princess. The princess was horrified and cried out, ‘go away you disgusting frog!’ But the king silenced his daughter and asked the frog what he was doing inside the palace. The frog told the kind all about the promise the princess had made to him. The king was very angry with his daughter and commanded her to keep her promise to the frog.\n\n‘We must always do as we promise, daughter.’\n\n‘But he is just a frog and I am a princess,’ she said, almost in tears once again.\n\n‘That does not matter. You must do as you said you would do.’\n\nThe king made the princess serve the frog a small plate of food which the little frog hungrily gobbled down.\n\nThe princess was angry at her father and even angrier at the frog. She thought it wrong that a frog should be inside the palace, eating at her table with the king. But the king paid no attention to his daughter’s foul mood.\n\nEventually the princess had had enough of the little frog and stood to go to bed. She bid her father goodnight and made to leave, but the frog reminded the princess of her promise to stay with him and be his friend. The king agreed that the princess must take the little frog to bed with her so that he might sleep on her pillow.\n\n‘I will not do it!’ exclaimed the princess. But the king insisted his daughter keep her promise.\n\nAlthough she did not want to, the princess knew that she must do as her father instructed. She placed her hand on the table and the little frog jumped into her palm. Then she went up to her bedroom.\n\nOnce away from the king, the princess was very mean to the little frog. She threw him onto her bed and told him that he was an ugly creature, and that he was very impudent to assume he could sleep on the pillow of a princess.\n\nShe got ready for bed and pulled the covers up close around her, ignoring the little frog who was sitting on the edge of her pillow.\n\n‘Why do you hate me so?’ asked the frog. I did as you asked and rescued your golden ball from the bottom of the lake. All I asked in return was for you to keep your promise to be my friend.’\n\nThe frog lowered his head and tears escaped from his sad, wide eyes as he began to cry. ‘I have been living by the lake for many years and all I wanted was to have your company. It is not a good life to be all alone with nobody to talk to.’\n\nThe princess was very moved by the frog’s tears and her heart began to soften. Although she was a princess, and she had everything a young woman might want, she was an only child with no brothers or sisters to play with. The princess had grown up alone in the palace and she often wished that she was able to share her time with others. Often she would hear the young children playing on the other side of the palace walls and she was envious of their laughter and games.\n\nThe princess and the frog talked into the night and soon the princess forgot altogether that he was a frog and thought of him in a kind way. She shared stories her father had told her as a baby, and the frog enjoyed listening very much.\n\nTowards dawn both the frog and the princess were very tired. The princess realised that she was happy to have a friend to talk to, and she regretted being so mean to the little frog. Just as they were both about to fall asleep, the princess leaned forwards and kissed the frog on the lips.\n\nInstantly there was a blinding flash of silver light. The princess closed her eyes in shock. When she opened them a handsome prince stood before her and the little frog had vanished altogether.\n\n‘You have set me free with your kindness, princess,’ said the handsome prince. ‘You kept your promise and you befriended me even though I was just a frog.’\n\nThe very next morning the prince asked the king for his daughter’s hand in marriage. The king agreed at once and the young couple were wed in the palace grounds next to the lake, beneath the shadows of the Nakla trees.\n\nFrom that day forwards the princess was a changed person. She knew how important it was to keep a promise, and she treated her people with kindness and respect no matter how rich or how poor they were.\n\n"

Together, they decided to come the next morning and catch those fishes.\n\nOne of the three fishes, who was also the wisest, heard the conversation between the fisherman and his fellows.\n\nIt immediately rushed to the other two and explained them the entire situation, and also suggested that they leave the pond immediately and move to another place.\n\nThe second fish agreed and decided to move out from the pond quickly.\n\nThe third fish, however, mocked at them. He felt that the pond was their home, and they must not leave their home.\n\nSince the other two fishes were unable to convince the third fish, they left the pond and decided to let him follow his own course of action.\n\nThe next day, the fisherman and his fellows cast their nets and caught plenty of fishes. They also managed to catch the third fish, who had refused to leave the pond, while the other two fishes, who left earlier, were saved.\n\nMoral: One of the most prominent lessons and morals one can learn from this three fish’s story is the importance of wisdom."

Thousands of cranes lived in this tree. In a deep hole in its trunk, there also lived a big black snake.\n\nThe snake used to climb up the tree to its branches and eat the baby cranes from their nests when their parents were away in search of food.\n\nThis had become a daily routine. And the unfortunate cranes were the soft targets. Every evening, on return to their nests, the hapless cranes would find their nestlings missing, and they were so helpless that they could not do anything to get rid of the big black snake.\n\nOne day, a crab saw some cranes standing by the side of the lake and weeping bitterly. He asked them the reason for their grief. The cranes said, \"There's a big black snake living in the banyan tree. Every day he eats up our babies. We don't know how to get rid of him.\"\n\nThe crab thought to himself that the cranes too were crabs' enemies. They ate crabs' babies. Why not give the cranes an idea which not only would kill the snake but finish the cranes also.\n\nSo, the crab said, \"Don't weep. I have an idea which will help kill the snake.\"\n\n\"Yes, please help us,\" requested the cranes.\n\n\"There is a big mongoose living a little distance from the banyan trees.

They acted according to the plan.\n\nThereafter, the mongoose ate up all the fish put all along the path leading up to his home and then reached the banyan tree. There he found the snake in the hole. Fierce fighting took place between them and the mongoose killed the snake.\n\nBut instead of going back to his hole after killing the serpent, the mongoose further climbed up the tree and started eating the baby cranes, one by one. Soon the mongoose ate up all the baby cranes living in the banyan tree.\n\nAfter eating a large number of baby cranes, the mongoose became very fat and lazy. One day, while he was sleeping on a branch of a tree, he slipped and fell on to the ground and died then and there.\n\nMoral: Never act hastily on your enemy's advice."

So the frog prince jumped on top of the snake and commanded, “Take me to my parents.\"\n\nThe king and the queen were amazed at the sight. “Father, look, I am riding a snake,\" shouted the prince. “Let us also ride the snake,\" the queen urged the frog king. So they all sat on the snake.\n\n“You are moving very slowly,\" complained the prince. “What can I do,\" answered the snake sadly. “I have not eaten for several days.\"\n\n“Why have you not eaten? The royal mount should be fast and strong,\" said the king.\n\n“I can eat only with your permission,\" answered the snake.\n\n“Your subjects are my food.\"\n\n“How can I permit you to eat us?\" asked the king.\n\n“Not the royal frogs,\" explained the snake. “I cannot permit you to eat my subjects,\" said the frog king.\n\nThe prince was upset and cried. “Father, please permit him. I don’t want to loose him.\"\n\nEven the queen spoke up. “Do permit the snake. How many frogs can he eat anyway? We have many subjects.\"\n\nAt last the king had to grant permission. The snake began to eat many frogs every day. Soon he was very strong and healthy. Now, he moved very quickly. The prince was thrilled to ride a snake that moved so fast.\n\nOne day the snake went to the frog king. “I am hungry O king. There are no more frogs left in the pond. So now I am going to cat you all.\"\n\nAnd the wicked snake pounced on all the three royal frogs and ate them up."

      "body": "The Owl and The Swan:\n\nOnce there were two friends, Kanakaksha the owl and Sumitra the swan. Sumitra was the king of the swans. But Kanakaksha was an ordinary owl. He was afraid to let Sumitra know that he was a poor owl. So he told Sumitra that he was also a king and also had subjects. Every day the owl would fly to the pond where the swan lived.\n\nOne day, as usual, Kanakaksha flew to the pond to meet his friend. \"Good morning Sumitra, how are you today?\" he asked.\n\n\"Good morning my friend, I am fine. Just caught up with the usual work of a king - solving disputes among my subjects,\" replied Sumitra.\n\nJust then, one of Sumitra's subjects came up to him and whispered something in his ear.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Sumitra. \"Kanakaksha, please give me a moment. I have to settle another dispute between two of my subjects.\"\n\n\"Very well Sumitra,\" answered the owl. \"I will wait right here.\" After Sumitra left to find his subjects, Kanakaksha thought to himself, \"If Sumitra comes to know that I am just an ordinary owl, he will stop being my friend. I have to impress him.\"\n\nAs Kanakaksha was flying through the woods in search of food, he saw a camp of soldiers and their commander. He suddenly got an idea. He flew back to the pond and called Sumitra. \"I want you to visit my kingdom,\" invited the owl.\n\n\"One day I will surely visit your kingdom Kanakaksha,\" answered Sumitra the swan.\n\n\"Not someday,\" urged Kanakaksha. \"You should come today. I come to meet you every day.\" Sumitra agreed and the owl took the swan to the place where the soldiers had camped.\n\n\"This is my kingdom and these are my subjects,\" said Kanakaksha to Sumitra proudly. Sumitra knew that Kanakaksha was no king. But he did not want to hurt his poor foolish friend's feelings.\n\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed Sumitra.\n\n\"Are your soldiers getting ready to move?\"\n\n\"No! How could they without my permission?\" The owl flew over the camp, hooting aloud \"Ho - ho!\" The commander heard the owl and said, \"An owl is hooting. It's a bad omen. We will have to postpone our march.\"\n\nThe next day Kanakaksha and Sumitra came to the same place. Just as the army got ready to move. Kanakaksha hooted again. The army stopped again. On the third day again, Kanakaksha hooted just as the commander mounted his horse.\n\n\"Oh, this omen maker! Will someone take care of him?\" shouted the commander angrily.\n\n\"This time my poor friend has gone too far,\" thought Sumitra the swan to himself.\n\nA soldier stepped forward and shot an arrow at the owl perched on a branch. But Kanakaksha spotted the arrow and swiftly flew away. Sumitra, who had been next to Kanakaksha, did not see the arrow coming. The arrow hit Sumitra and he died.\n\n\"Oh my foolishness has caused the death of my good friend,\" thought Kanakaksha bitterly to himself."

      "body": "The Bird Of Folklore:\n\nIt is wintertime, and the earth is covered with a layer of snow, as smooth as if it were marble cut from a mountain. The sky is high and clear, and the wind as sharp as an elfin-forged sword; the trees stand like white coral or resemble blooming almond branches, and the air is as fresh as it is in the high Alps. The night is beautiful with streaming northern lights and countless twinkling stars.\n\nStorms are coming; the clouds rise and scatter swan feathers; the snowflakes drift down, covering the hollow lane, the houses, the open fields, and the quiet streets. But we are sitting in a cozy room, before a glowing fire, and tales of olden days are being told. We hear a legend.\n\n\"By the open sea there lay a Viking's grave, and on it at midnight sat the ghost of that buried hero. He was a king, the golden crown encircling his brow. His hair fluttered in the wind, and he was clad in iron and steel. He bowed his head sorrowfully and sighed in deep grief, like an unblessed spirit.\n\n\"Then a ship came near. The men cast anchors and went on land. Among them was a scald, and he stepped forth toward the kingly form and asked, 'Why do you grieve and suffer?'\n\n\"Thereupon the dead man answered, 'No man has sung of my deeds; they are dead and gone. The song has never carried them over the land and into the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest, no peace.'\n\n\"And he told of his work and his mighty deeds; the men of his time had known them, but not sung of them, for then there were no scalds.\n\n\"Then the old scald plucked the strings of his harp and sang of the hero - of his daring as a youth, his strength in manhood, and his great and noble deeds. At that the dead one's face brightened, like the edge of a cloud touched with moonlight; happy and blessed, the form arose in beams of glory and vanished like a trail of the northern lights. Only the green mound of turf with the stone devoid of runes remained to be seen; but over it, at the last sound of the chords, and as if it had come from the harp itself, there flew a tiny bird. It was a most beautiful songbird, with the tuneful melodies of the thrush, the throbbing melodies of the human heart, songs of home, as the bird of passage hears them. The bird flew over the hill, over the valley, and over the forest and meadow. It was the Bird of Folklore, which never dies.\"\n\nWe hear the song; we hear it nowhere in our room, in the winter evening, while the white bees swarm outside and the tempest tightens its strong grip. The Bird sings not only heroic songs; it sings soft, sweet love songs, rich and many; it sings of faithfulness in the North; it gives us fairy tales in melodies and words; it has proverbs and a language in song, and thereby as if runes were laid on a dead man's tongue, it can speak to us of ancient times, and thus we know the homeland of the Bird of Folklore.\n\nIn ancient heathen days, in the times of the Vikings, its nest was in the harp of the bard. In the days of knighthood, when iron fists held the scales of justice, and only might was right, when the peasant and the dog were of equal value, where then did the Bird find shelter? Brutality and narrow-mindedness alike had no thought for it. But over the balcony of the castle, where the lady sat before her parchment and wrote down the old records in song and story; in the humble green-turf hut, where the wandering peddler sat on the bench beside the good woman, telling her tales - there, above them, fluttered and flew, twittered and sang, the Bird that never dies so long as the earth is green under the foot of man - the Bird of Folklore.\n\nNow it sings for us here. Outside are the snowstorm and the night. The Bird lays runs on our tongue; we know again our homeland, as God speaks to us in our mother tongue in the melodies of the Bird of Folklore, and the old memories arise within us; faded colors are bright again; song and tale give the joy of a blessed drink, lifting mind and soul until the evening seems like a Christmas festivity. The snow is drifting, and the ice is crackling; the storm reigns; it has great power; it is the lord, but not our Lord!\n\nIt is wintertime, the wind still as sharp as an elfin-forged sword; the snow is drifting - it has been drifting, it seems to us, for days and weeks - and it lies like a monstrous snow mountain over the big town; it is like a weighty dream in the winter night. All beneath it is hidden and seemingly nonexistent; only the golden cross on the church, the symbol of faith, rises above the snow grave and glitters against the blue sky in the clear sunshine.\n\nAnd away over the snow-covered town fly the birds of heaven, the large and the small; they chirp and they sing, each in its own tongue.\n\nFirst is the flock of sparrows; they chirp about all the little things in street and lane, in nest and house; they know tales of the kitchen and the parlor. \"We know that buried town,\" they say. \"Every living soul there has cheep, cheep, cheep!\"\n\nThen the black ravens and crows fly over the white snow. \"Dig! Dig!\" they scream. \"There's still something to get down there, something for the belly - that's the most important thing. That's the opinion of most people down below there, and that opinion is caw, caw, caw!\"\n\nThe wild swans come with whizzing wings and sing of the greatness and glory that still live in the thoughts and hearts of the men in the snow-covered slumber of the town. It is not the sleep of death, for evidence of life comes forth; we hear it in tones of music; they swell and sound as if they are coming from the church organ, they are gripping as a strain from an elfin mound, as Ossianic songs, as the winged rush of the Valkyries. What harmony! It speaks to our innermost heart, uplifts our thoughts; we hear the Bird of Folklore! And now the warm breath of God breathes down from above; the snow mountain breaks open, and the sun shines in through it. Spring is coming, and the birds are coming, a new generation, with the same familiar tones. Hearken to the drama of the year - the mighty snowstorm - the weighty dream of a winter night! All fetters shall be broken here, and everything shall rise again at the beautiful song of the Bird of Folklore - the Bird that never dies."

      "body": "The Foolish Crow:\n\nThe winter has been especially cold. The snow lay thick and heavy on the ground. The squirrels, the badgers, and the hedgehogs had vanished into their snug winter homes to sleep away the cold, dark months. The swifts and the swallows had left for warmer countries long ago. Even the slugs and snails had disappeared, hiding away in some dark, warm patch of woodland to wait for the spring. The woods and fields were silent and empty. Only a big, black Crow was hunting for her evening meal.\n\nThe crow had flown all day in search of food. But she had found nothing, not even a tiny mouse or a piece of someone's leftover lunch. Now she was tired and hungry. She cawed sadly.\n\n\"I will have to go without dinner tonight,' she thought as she flapped slowly across the sky in one last desperate search for something to eat.\n\nShe was on the point of turning back when she saw a thin column of smoke coming up into the sky, far away in the distance.\n\n\"Smoke means fire and fire means cooking and cooking means food!\" thought the Crow. She flew as fast as she could, towards the curling smoke. The smoke came from the chimney of a large farmhouse where the farmer's wife was cooking dinner for her family. A delicious-smelling stew was bubbling in a large pot over the fire and loaves of fresh-baked bread were on the table, ready to be cut into slices. A pat of butter and a chunk of cheese lay in their platters on the window sill. The farmer's wife had left the window open so the cold air would keep the butter from melting and the cheese from sweating.\n\nThe crow saw the cheese by the open window. Quick as a flash, she flew down to the window sill, picked cheese in her big black beak and flew off. The farmer's wife was stirring the stew, with her back to the window. She did not see the Crow. Crow was very pleased with herself. 'Nothing like a piece of cheese on a cold winter afternoon!' she thought.\n\nShe flew towards a clump of tall trees and perched comfortably on a bare branch high above the ground to enjoy her meal in comfort.\n\nA wily old Fox lay hidden among the bushes in the farmer's garden. He had roamed the woods and fields all day in search of food. But he had found nothing to eat, not a bird nor a mouse nor even the scraps from someone's picnic. Now he was tired and hungry.\n\n\"I'll have to go without dinner tonight.' he sighed.\n\nHe was on the point of turning back when he saw the Crow perch on the bare branch with the piece of cheese in her beak.\n\n\"What a lovely, smelly piece of cheese!' thought it was Fox. I must have that piece of cheese for my dinner. Now, if only I can take that cheese away from the Crow...\"\n\nFox watched Crow settle herself comfortably on the branch. He smiled slyly to himself. Strolling up to the foot of the tree, the Fox called out.\n\n\"Good evening. Mrs. Crow! You look well today!'\n\nThe Crow looked down at the fox in surprise. She had never heard him speak so politely before.\n\nFox continued. 'Oh Mrs. Crow, how beautiful you are! Your feathers are so black! So smooth and shining! Truly. I've never seen such feathers before!'\n\nCrow was even more surprised. No one had ever called her beautiful before! Of course, she had always known how pretty she was. But it was pleasant to be admired by someone else.\n\nFox looked up at her and sighed. 'How grateful you are. Mrs. Crow, how elegant! You fly so wonderfully well too and higher than an eagle!'\n\nCrow held herself taller. She had always known how graceful and elegant she was. Of course, she could fly most wonderfully high! How clever of the Foxes to know that. She flapped her wings just a little bit so he could admire them again. What a charming creature he was!\n\nFox took a deep breath and continued. 'Your claws, ahem, I mean your talons. Mrs. Crow! They're stronger than steel!'\n\nAh... her talons! She had always been proud of her talons. She hopped clumsily on the branch so that the Fox could take another look at her claws. Really, he did say the nicest things!\n\nThe Crow was by now quite sure that she was the prettiest, most graceful and the strongest bird of all.\n\nThe Fox smiled secretly to himself. He looked admiringly at the Crow and said. 'Dear Mrs. Crow, I have not heard your voice. It must be the sweetest voice in the world, as beautiful as you are. Dear Mrs. Crow, won't you sing for me?'\n\nThe Crow was flattered. All the other birds had told her that she had an awful voice. And here was the Fox begging her to sing for him! Of course, she had always known what a lovely voice she had...\n\nCrow took a deep breath and opened her beak in a loud and raucous caw!' Down dropped a piece of cheese! The Fox snapped it up as it fell and swallowed it before the Crow realized what had happened.\n\nFox walked off chuckling. 'Next time Mrs. Crow, be careful what you believe!' he cried as he vanished through the trees.\n\nThe Crows were left feeling foolish. How could she have been so vain and so silly, as to be taken in by Fox's clever words and to lose her lovely dinner!\n\nThe crow ruffled her feathers sadly and got ready for a hungry night."

      "body": "The Indigo Jackal:\n\nIn a jungle, there lived a pack of jackals. They would hunt together to eat from the left-overs of the lion's meal. One of the jackals was getting a little old. All the younger jackals bullied him and did not allow him to share the food.\n\n\"I have to do something to satisfy my hunger. Like this, I will not survive for very long,\" thought the jackal to himself.\n\nHe decided to leave his pack and go in search of food. He wandered around for many days but could not find any food. Everywhere he went, other animals chased him away.\n\nFinally, he decided to venture into the village in search of food. After nightfall, the jackal walked down the village streets in search of food. Suddenly a pack of dogs began to chase the jackal. Scared for his life, the jackal ran as fast as his weak legs could carry him. Finding no way to escape, the jackal jumped into the first open house he found.\n\nSuddenly he found himself in a vat of foul-smelling liquid. It was a vat of indigo dye. The house belonged to the village washerman. When the jackal climbed hurriedly out of the liquid and peered out fearfully, the dogs which were waiting for him outside, let out a howl and ran away with their tails tucked between their legs. The jackal was surprised. But finding the dogs gone, he carefully went back into the jungle.\n\nThe jackal went to the water hole in the jungle to quench his thirst. As the jackal went closer, all the other animals which had come there ran away in panic. The jackal looked around in surprise to see what had frightened them. But he saw nothing wrong. He was very thirsty and so went to the water hole to quench his thirst. As he bent down to drink, he was shocked to see a strange-looking creature in a brilliant and unearthly color looking up at him from the water. The jackal was at first frightened but soon realized that he was looking at his own reflection. He remembered the foul-smelling liquid into which he had fallen. \"So that is why all those dogs and all these animals in the forest were afraid!\" he reasoned to himself. His cunning mind thought of a plan quickly.\n\nHe called out to the frightened animals. \"Do not be afraid of me. I have been sent down by Brahma to protect you.\" The animals all believed him at once and made him king.\n\nAs the days went by, the jackal became prouder and lazier. He did not have to look for food any longer. His subjects would bring him food to the cat and take care of every need of his. The jackal was very happy with his life.\n\nOne full moon night, the pack of jackals to whom the jackal had belonged before began to howl at the moon. The indigo jackal had not heard his brothers howl for a long time. The urge to howl was too strong for him to control. He threw his head back and began to howl to hisheart's content.\n\nThe other animals were astonished to hear their heaven-sent king howl like a common jackal. And soon they realized their mistake.\n\n\"This is not an extraordinary animal sent by Brahma. He howls like a jackal,\" said the bear. \"Yes. He's calling out to the other jackals.\" \"He has fooled us.\" \"He has to be punished,\" said several other animals. \"Come let's teach him a lesson.\" The animals joined together and gave the indigo jackal a severe beating."

There, in the forest lived a king lion and his minister, a cunning fox. Once, the king lion was badly wounded in fierce fighting with an elephant. He became unable to hunt for his prey. So he asked his minister, the cunning fox, to bring some good meals for him. As the fox used to share the prey, which king lion hunted for his meals, he at once, set out to search for food.\n\nWhile wandering here and there, the fox met a donkey. The donkey looked foolish, nervous and hungry. The fox asked him, \"Hello! you seem to be new to this forest. Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"I come from the nearby town\", said the donkey. \"My master, the dhobi, makes me work all day but doesn't feed me properly. So I've left my home to find a better place to live in and eat properly.\"\n\n\"I see\", said the fox. \"Don't worry. I'm a senior minister in this forest kingdom. Come with me to the king's palace. Our king needs a bodyguard, who has the experience of town life. You will live in the palace and eat a lot of green grass growing around it ' \"\n\nThe donkey was very happy to hear all this from the minister fox of the forest kingdom. He proceeded with him to the royal palace.\n\nSeeing a donkey before him the king lion became highly impatient and pounced upon him immediately. But on account of constant hunger, the king lion had gone weak. He couldn't overpower the donkey. The donkey freed himself and ran for his life.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" said the fox to king lion, \"you shouldn't have acted in such a haste. You have scared your prey.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said king lion. \"Try to bring him here once again.\"\n\nThe hungry fox went again to the donkey and said to him, \"What a funny fellow you are. Why did you run away like that?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't IT?' asked the donkey.\n\n\"My dear,\" said the fox, \"you were being tested for your alertness as a royal bodyguard of the king. Thank god, you showed a quick reflex, otherwise, you would have been rejected for the job.\"\n\nThe donkey believed what the fox said and accompanied him once again to the palace. There at the palace, the king lion was hiding behind the thick bushes. As soon as the donkey passed by the bushes, the lion pounced upon him and killed him instantly.\n\nJust when the lion was about to begin eating the donkey, the fox said, \"Your Majesty, you're going to have your meals after quite a few days. It's better you first take a bath and offer prayers.\"\n\n\"Hmm!\" the king lion roared and said to the fox, \"Stay here. I'll be back right now.\"\n\nThe lion went to take a bath and offer his prayers. In the meantime, the fox ate the donkey's brain. When the king lion came back to eat his prey, he was surprised to see that the donkey's brain was missing.\n\n\"Where is this donkey's brain?\" The king lion roared in great anger.\n\n\"The donkey's brain!\" the fox expressed his surprise. \"Your Majesty, you're fully aware that donkeys don't have a brain. Had that donkey ever had a brain, he would never have come with me to this palace for the second time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed king lion, \"that's the point.\"\n\nAnd he started eating happily the rest of the flesh of the dead donkey.\n\nMoral: Sometimes a cunning argument outwits normal intelligence."

      "body": "The Goose And Springtime:\n\nThere once was winter so fierce and freezing that even the air was turning to ice.\n\nThe snow was so deep that it buried barns, farms and entire forests and the wind wailed as fierce as fire and burned the skin. And worst of all, April was almost over and there seemed to be no end to this blast of icy misery.\n\nDespite the pressure of tons of prayers for Spring to come and melt the snow, Winter persisted.\n\nThe animals in the woods were running out of food. Some had frozen to death when they had gone out and tried to find food for their young. The situation was so grim that there was nothing left to do but cry, but the tears froze as they left their eyes.\n\nThis was the way it was for a fairly long time; until the geese started to fly north again as they always do when it's springtime.\n\nBut when they arrived and saw that Winter had still not retired they became just as frightened as everyone else. If Winter continued much longer the whole world would surely come to an end.\n\nAll the animals put their differences aside and formed committees to deal with the crisis. Discussions were held, debates debated, vows made, speeches given and clever plans and lists were drawn up but when it came to doing, no one really knew what to do. All the animals sat staring across at one another as if begging with their eyes \"help me!\" But no one was willing to make a sacrifice. And this was no time to be selfish. Only one goose realized that in order to save her family and friends, she would have to act and so decided to set off in search of Spring. When all the other animals heard this they laughed, \"What! How can one insignificant goose bring an entire season to us! It comes when it sees fit. Don't be a silly goose!\"\n\n\"No, this is not the time to be selfish,\" she said and flew off in search of Spring leaving all the animals shivering and freezing in the frozen wilderness as they desperately studied how to build igloos.\n\nThe poor goose had no idea where to look for Spring and soon because of the wind and snow she became lost and tired and was forced to take refuge inside the hollow of a tree. There she hoped to get the rest and warmth she needed to continue on her journey. Little did she know though that she had flown into the home of a shivering family of squirrels. As soon as she entered, they started asking her questions about winter. She didn't want to tell them about her plan. She thought they would laugh at her and she was already discouraged enough as it was. But she took pity on them because they were shivering and she wanted to give them some hope.\n\n\"I'm going to find Spring. This is not a time to be selfish and stay locked up inside. Maybe she is sleeping or is in trouble, but I must find her before we all die.\"\n\nNot one squirrel laughed, quite the contrary, they all sat together for a long time in silence, thinking of ways to help the brave goose. Then the littlest squirrel who everyone made fun of because of it's far-fetched plans and ideas, spoke up, \"Maybe Springtime is being held prisoner by the evil Winter up at the North Pole. If we could go there and free her, we would save the world. I have a sword! I can climb onto your back and feed you nuts as we race off to fight the evil Winter monster! Let's hurry before he kills her!\" The young tot raced into his room to grab his sword and nuts. Everyone broke into laughter and started calling the little squirrel silly names. His mother put him to bed early. But since the goose had no other suggestions, she thought that the Arctic would be a good place to start.\n\n\"I see no other alternative. I must go to the Arctic and see what can be done there.\"\n\nThe family protested, \"But it is even colder there and the wind is stronger too. You will certainly have a most unpleasant death.\"\n\nThe goose understood well what they were saying but she had no choice. The squirrels bowed their heads in sad agreement. There was nothing to do but help the goose prepare for the great journey that lay ahead. Grandmother Squirrel had also travelled in her day and had a special coat from Russia that she gave the brave little goose.\n\n\"Take this coat. It will keep you warm.\"\n\n\"But what about you?\" the goose protested.\n\n\"Think of it as my sacrifice, for as you said, this is certainly not a time to be selfish.\"\n\nSo the next day the goose left with the coat, for her journey to the arctic: one of the coldest, snowiest places on earth. She flew as high in the air as she dared, as much above the raging snowstorm as she could. The coat kept her only slightly cold as opposed to freezing cold and after weeks of sometimes flying in circles she came to the ice castle, which belonged to the Winter King. With her beak she meekly knocked on the door. A knight made of ice with a snowy beard answered, \"We have no more ice cream—go away!\"\n\n\"I don't want any ice cream,\" the goose said, \"I'm here to see the Winter King. It's very important.\"\n\n\"Really?\" the knight exclaimed in surprise. \"You want to see the King? My goodness, that is so kind of you. All everybody ever wants is ice cream. I'm sure he would be more than pleased to see someone who wants to see him. Please, do come in!\"\n\nThe goose was led through a labyrinth of corridors whose walls were made of icy mirrors with icicle chimes dangling in the soft wind that brushed through. The entire palace confused her very much. Snow servants and ice knights were skating through the hallways, and on the walls and ceiling, because there, there was no up or down. The castle itself wasn't so cold and except for the mirrors, the goose found it to be quite a comfortable home.\n\nShe didn't have to wait to see the King and she was led to his throne straight away. \"What can I do for you?\" said the humongous Winter King, clearly pleased to have a guest. \"Can I offer you some ice-cream?\" He himself was eating a ton of ice cream with a spoon the size of a satellite dish.\n\n\"Sir, it's almost the end of May and Spring has not come. The animals are starving and the people are freezing. If you have Spring could you please release her or everything will die. If it pleases you, I will gladly take her place.\"\n\nThe Winter King was touched by the goose's willingness to sacrifice herself. \"You are a brave being, little, little one. But you are wrong in believing that I have her. I am not so evil as you think.\"\n\nThe goose blushed.\n\n\"Everyone believes I am evil but no one bothers to come and see for themselves. It is all a plot. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Yes, I know Spring has not come,\" the King answered, \"But what can I do? I'm tired and I need to rest too, so I wish she would come. But there is nothing I can do. I can't leave. We can't be without a season.\"\n\n\"Well Sir, do you know where she is or do you know anyone who might know where she is?\"\n\n\"Well you would think that I should know, after all I am her father. But it seems she doesn't want to do as she is told. Instead, what does she do? She runs off with the holidays for a little amusement. I've sent all my messengers out to find her, and I think she knows she is missing, but she still refuses to do her job. But don't worry, when she returns she will be punished.\"\n\n\"What if she doesn't return, can't we just have Summer now?\"\n\n\"What?\" The Winter King roared. \"Never! Him and I keep as far away from each other as possible. It's my daughter's job to deal with him. I would never call on him. All he wants to do is destroy me. It's he that is plotting against me. He is jealous of me. I'm bigger than he is and I'm more respected and feared than he is. Nevertheless people are fools enough to love him more than me. But what can I do about that?\"\n\n\"Well where is Summer? Maybe Spring is with him since it seems you have a nasty temper.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" the Winter King asked, leaning forward with a wicked smile. It was clearly his intention to frighten the goose.\n\nBut the goose had no time to entertain any fears, \"No offence Sir, just that maybe she went to live with him.\"\n\n\"I see. I never thought of that. Maybe they are both plotting against me. They have already managed to conquer certain parts of the Earth. But don't even think of visiting him, he doesn't even live on Earth and you would die trying to get to his palace. I'm the only season that lives on Earth, with my daughter of course. No, your only hope is to go and wake up Yeporok.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" the goose asked.\n\n\"He's the night guard for this planet. He sleeps most of the time. He really doesn't need to be awake if all the seasons do their jobs.\"\n\n\"How can he help, I don't understand?\" the goose asked.\n\n\"Well he can nudge the Earth in the direction of the sun, and then I can relax and get some rest. You see I can't leave my duty until the next season arrives and when Spring's late and she often is, the mindless little thing, I'm stuck working overtime and there's nothing I can do about it-and I'm the King! Imagine that. You know, it did happen once before that Spring was late. I think it was almost the beginning of June before she came. That woke Yeporok up and he tilted the Earth and as far as our seasons are concerned, that is the same as a good beating. It's not very pleasant. I myself have gotten one, but only one when I was very young.\"\n\n\"Sir, do you think that I can wake Yeporok up myself?\"\n\n\"Sure you can but there is a problem. You will have to die.\" This startled the goose, but then when she thought of all her friends suffering so far away, she decided that this was not the time to be selfish.\n\n\"Yes, I am ready to do whatever is necessary,\" and she listened closely to what the Winter King had to say.\n\n\"You have to climb up to the top of the North Pole and tickle his stomach, that will get his attention. But you can't tickle him with your fingers or in your case with your wings. You have to tickle him with your heart. Make your heart beat fast, thinking of someone you love may help. If that doesn't work then picture them dying. This will probably wake him up. But as I said he doesn't like to be woken up and he kills whoever so dares do it. I'm afraid that that is just the way it is.\"\n\nSo without further delay, the goose rushed off for the North Pole. When she reached it she wasted no time and flew to the top. She thought of all her friends and how she would never see them again and her tiny little heart sped up faster and faster until it broke. Then she heard a roar and saw a bright light and after that the tiny brave goose was no more. But it was enough to bring Spring, and after getting a good beating the snow quickly melted, it grew warm and all her friends and the whole world besides, were saved.\n\nI heard this story when I was a child. I asked why it was that we got goosebumps when we were cold. My great grandfather told me this story and explained that it was in tribute to the goose that died for everyone, that we say goosebumps when we are cold.\n\n\"But what about when we are afraid?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ugh, that is a different goose,\" was his response.\n\nWhether this story is true or not is anyone's guess as you see, my great grandfather heard the story while he was drunk, fighting over a woman in a bar. He added, \"Boy, never fight over a woman, always fight beside them, because there they can only see half of you. And of course, if you fight under them, you're a dead man.\""

      "body": "The Rabbits And The Elephants:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a herd of elephants in a deep jungle. Their king was a huge elephant by the name of Chaturdanta. In the middle of this jungle, there was a big lake where all the animals went to drink water. Once it so happened, that it didn't rain for the whole year and the lakes went dry. The elephants, after a great deal of discussion, decided to move to the other forest, where there was a lake named Chandrasar. This lake was full of water and never went dry even if there was no rain.\n\nAnd so, the elephants set out for the lake 'Chandrasar'. They felt very happy about reaching the new lake. They bathed in the freshwater of the lake and also enjoyed playing and spewing water on each other with their trunks. After having bathed satisfactorily and quenched their thirst with the sweet water of the lake they came out of it and entered the deep forest.\n\nBut, there lived many rabbits in their burrows around the lake area. When the herd of elephants walked around they stamped the burrows with their heavy feet. Thus, many rabbits were either killed or were left physically handicapped.\n\nSo, in order to salvage the grave situation, the rabbits held a meeting and discussed this new calamity. At one point, they decided to shift from that dangerous place and live somewhere else. But a rabbit named Lambkarna advised them to exercise patience. He offered his services for the sake of all the other rabbits and said, \"Don't worry friends. Just see, how I drive these~ elephants away from this forest\n\nThe next day, Lambkarna sat on a high rock. The rock lay in the main path of the elephants, leading to the lake. When the elephant passed by the rock, the rabbit addressed the king of the elephants in a tough voice, \"You're a cruel fellow. You've trampled many of my relatives and friends under your feet. I too am the king of rabbits. I stay in heaven with the God Moon. God Moon is very much annoyed with you.\"\n\nThe king elephant was frightened to hear this. He said in a trembling voice, \"Please take me to God Moon. I'll ask for his forgiveness.\"\n\n\"All right\", said the clever rabbit. \"See me tonight at the lake.\"\n\nThe king elephant, then, as told by the rabbit, reached the lake at night. The king rabbit and the king elephant both stood near the edge of the lake. It was a silent and moonlit night. A mild breeze was blowing. The rabbit asked the elephant to look carefully into the water of the lake.\n\nAs soon as the king elephant looked into the lake, he saw the reflection of a half-moon in the lake's water. Just then a mild breeze blew and the reflection of the moon in the water became wavy\n\nPointing to the wavy reflection of the moon, the king rabbit said,\n\n\"Look for yourself, how annoyed God Moon is with you. Better you ask for his mercy, otherwise, he might curse you to death ' \"\n\nThe king elephant became more and more frightened. He promised God Moon not to ever visit the lake with his friends.\n\nThe rabbits lived happily, thereafter.\n\nMoral: Clever move"

The relatives had an evil eye on his throne and often created problems for the king frog. In order to disrupt the smooth working of the kingdom, and with a view to causing impediments, they hatched a plan with the connivance of a minister of the kingdom and soon there was a revolt against the king frog. The king frog somehow managed to subdue the revolt, but he was very unhappy. He took a vow to take revenge and teach them the lesson of their life. One day, he came out of the well with the help of iron chains hanging on the walls of the well. He headed straight towards me. the hole of a big black serpent, which he had seen earlier.\n\nKeeping himself at a considerably safe distance, the king frog called out to the serpent. The serpent was surprised to hear a frog calling him. He came out of the hole.\n\n\"I wish to be your friend\", said the king frog.\n\n\"But we are born enemies,\" replied the serpent. \"How's it possible?\"\n\n\"I will make it possible. I have a proposal,\" said king frog. He spoke to the serpent about his plan and told him that he was bent upon teaching his relatives a lesson. \"I want to punish them. I will take you to the well and in the process, you can eat them all.\"\n\n\"Is it dry well?\" asked the serpent.\n\n\"There is not much water in it\", said the king frog. \"However, you needn't worry. There is a nice hole in the wall of the well, a little above the water level. You can eat my relative frogs and retire into it to take a rest.\"\n\n\"Okay, lead me to the well. I'll teach your relatives a lesson\", said the serpent hissing loudly.\n\nThe king frog took the serpent to his well and said, \"Here live my relatives and rebels. You can eat them all, but please spare my near and dear ones.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the serpent and entered the well followed by the king frog. There he started eating the frogs, one by one, as and when pointed out by the king frog. Soon all the enemies of the king frog were eaten up by the serpent.\n\nNow it was the turn of the king frog and his family. The serpent said to the king frog, \"As you see, I've finished all your relatives and rebels. I've eaten your disloyal minister. Now I've nothing to eat except you and your family.\"\n\nKing frog realized his folly. He had befriended his enemy to achieve his own selfish ends and settle his score with his enemies. The king frog felt as if the god of death was in his hot pursuit. He, somehow, managed to gather some courage and said to the serpent, \"No problem. I'll visit some other wells and ponds and persuade the frogs living there to resettle themselves in this empty well. Once they are here, you can feast on them with ease.\"\n\n\"That's, good\", the serpent became happy. \"Do it soon. I'm hungry.\"\n\nBoth the king frog and his wife came out of the well and took to their heels, never to return to the same well again.\n\nMoral: Never look to an enemy for help."

As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: \"You fool, what a Donkey for but to ride is upon?\"\n\nSo the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men. One of whom said: \"See that lazy youngster. He lets his father walk while he rides.\"\n\nSo the Man ordered his Boy to get off and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women. One of whom said to the other: \"Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.\"\n\nWell, the man did not know what to do. But at last, he took his Boy up before him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the town and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said :\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor Donkey of yours - you and your hulking son?\"\n\nThe man and Boy got off and tried to think of what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the Donkey's feet to it and raised the pole and the Donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the Donkey fell over the bridge and his fore-feet being tied together, he was drowned.\n\n\"That will teach you,\" said an old man who had followed them :\n\nMoral: You Can Not Please Everyone."

The Cub developed a unique mentality for Humans. The Cub stayed in illusion and wished to meet a human being once in its life. Due to its curiosity, the Cub went on to find a human being in the jungle.\n\nWhile wandering in the jungle, the Cub found a tall animal. It was a Horse. The Cub presumed the Horse as a Human Being. The Cub went to the Horse and asked him, “Are you a human being?” On this question of the Cub, the Horse replied, “No brother, I’m a horse. Humans are very intelligent. They ride on me!”\n\nThe Cub was left appalled on listening to the reply of the Horse. It asked the Horse in a surprising manner, “What? Human Beings ride on you?” “Yes, indeed!” the Horse replied.

To this, the Camel replied, “Yes! They are extremely intelligent. They use me for work purpose and put weight on me for traveling from one place to another.” The Cub thought, “This Camel was so tall. Yet a human uses it for his own good. He must be big and strong.”\n\nAfter traveling for a while, the Cub found a humongous animal with two long teeth. It was an Elephant. On seeing the Elephant, the Cub felt confident that it was a human being. The Cub went to the Elephant and said, “Are you a human being?”\n\nOn this statement of the Cub, the Elephant laughed a lot.

Humans force you to dance by threatening to beat you with a rod?” asked the Cub. On hearing the Elephant, the Cub felt assured that human beings were dangerous.\n\nThe Cub reached the edge of the jungle. There, the Cub noticed a man. The man was cutting woods through hammer and sickle. The Cub didn’t understand who was it. It went to the man and asked, “Have you ever seen a human being?” “Why do I need to see? I’m myself a human,” replied the man.\n\nThe Cub was shocked to see the man as it never thought a human being would be so different than its image. The Cub laughingly replied to the man, “You are human? I thought human beings are small and dangerous. I can hunt you at this very moment.” On seeing the Cub approaching towards him, the man used his intellect, “Stop! If you think you are stronger than me then try to remove this sickle from wood,” said the man.\n\nThe Cub put one of his hands in the gap and removed the sickle from the other. As soon as the Cub removed the sickle, the gap got closed and its hand got stuck. The Cub screamed out loud, “Oh, lord! It’s so painful! Save me!” The Cub realized its mistake and it said to the man, “Please, forgive me! I have understood that human beings are very intelligent. I promise that I will never confront a human being ever again!” On listening to this, the man removed the Cub’s hand and the Cub ran away into the jungle.\n\nMORAL OF ANIMAL MORAL STORIES FOR KIDS: WE MUST ALWAYS FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF OUR PARENTS."

There on its outskirts, he ate some food, but the quantity was not sufficient and he was still very hungry. Then he entered another village with the hope of getting some more food.\n\nAs soon as the jackal entered the village, a few dogs roaming there charged at him barking loudly. The jackal was terribly frightened. He began running through lanes in order to save himself from the dogs. Soon he saw a house. The door of the house was open. It was a washerman's house.' This is the right place for me to hide', the jackal thought to himself and ran into the open door.\n\nWhile trying to hide, the jackal slipped and fell into a tank full of blue color, which the washerman had kept ready to dye the clothes.\n\nSoon the barking of the dogs ceased. The jackal saw them going away. He came out of the tub. There was a big mirror fixed on the wall of a room. There was no one around. The jackal entered the room and saw his image in the mirror.

Those jackals had come from some other jungle and were howling, singing and dancing. The blue jackal forgot that he was a king and not an ordinary jackal any more. Instinctively, he too began howling, singing and dancing. All the animals were surprised to see their king howling like a jackal. Soon the word spread around that their king was simply a jackal and not a representative of Lord Brahma. He had fooled the animals.

But they, the birds themselves, could not agree on an impartial critic.\n\n\"It must be a bird, though,\" said the owl, who had been elected president by the assembly, for he is the bird of wisdom. \"We ought not to elect anyone from another branch of animals, except perhaps from the sea. There fish fly, like birds in the sky, but that, of course, is our only relationship. However, there are quite enough animals to select from between fish and birds.\"\n\nThen the stork took the floor and rattled from his beak, \"There are indeed beings between fish and birds. The children of the marsh, the Frogs - I am voting for them. They are extremely musical, and their choir singing is like church bells in a lonely wood. I get an urge to travel,\" said Stork, \"a tickling under my wings, when they begin to sing.\"\n\n\"I am also voting for the Frogs,\" said Heron. \"They are neither bird nor fish, but still they live with the fishes and sing like the birds.\"\n\n\"Now that's the musical part,\" said the owl. \"But the paper must speak of all the beauties of the forest. We must have coworkers. Let each of us consider everyone in his family.\"\n\nThen the little Lark sang out cheerfully and prettily, \"The Frog should not be the editor of the paper - no, it should be the Nightingale!\"\n\n\"Stop your chirping!\" said the owl. \"I am hooting to order! I know the Nightingale. We are both night birds. Each bird sings with his own beak. Neither he nor I ought to be elected because the paper would become an aristocratic or philosophic newspaper, a beau monde paper, run by high society. It must also be an organ for the common man.\"\n\nThey agreed that the paper should be called Morning Croak or Evening Croak - or just Croak. They unanimously voted for the latter.\n\nIt would fill a long-felt need in the forest. The Bee, the Ant, and the Gopher promised to write about industrial and engineering activities, in which they had great insight. The Cuckoo was nature's poet. Not counted among the songbirds, he was, however, of the greatest importance to the common man. \"He always praises himself; he is the vainest of all birds, and yet not much to look at,\" said Peacock.\n\nThen the Flesh Flies paid a visit to the editor in the forest. \"We offer our services. We know people, editors, and human criticism. We lay our larva in the fresh flesh - and then it decays within twenty-four hours. We can destroy a great talent, if necessary, in the editor's service. If a paper is a spokesman for a party, it dares to be rude; and if one loses a subscriber, one will get sixteen in return. Be cruel, give nicknames, put them in a pillory, whistle through your fingers like a gang of young radicals, and you become a power in the state.\"\n\n\"Such an air rover!\" said the Frog about the Stork. \"I looked up to him when I was little and felt a trembling admiration. And when he walked in the marsh and spoke of Egypt, my imagination carried me to wonderful foreign lands. Now he doesn't impress me anymore - that is all just an echo in my memory.\n\n\"I have become wiser, rational, important - I write critical articles in Croak. I am what, in the most correct and proper writing and speech of our language is called a Croaker!\n\nIn the human world, there is also that sort. I have written a piece about it on the back page of our paper.\""

But the Eagle pounced upon her prey, the sweep of her great wings tumbling the Beetle a dozen feet away. Furious at the disrespect shown her, the Beetle flew to the Eagle's nest and rolled out the eggs. Not one did she spare. The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know.\n\nNext year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the eggs rolled from his lap.\n\nNow the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground. For so Jupiter commanded.\n\nMoral: Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong."

Frustrated, the farmer sighed, “Look Dobbin, you’ve been with me for many years and you served me well, but I can’t afford to feed horses who can’t work anymore!” The old horse did not move and hung his head.\n\n“Okay, I’ll make you a deal. Prove your worth to me by bringing a lion and I will keep and feed you for the rest of your days. Now, hurry along! You have some lion hunting to do,” said the farmer patting the horse on its back. Dobbin moved slowly out of the field and into the forest. He wandered around until it grew dark, looking for a place to rest for the night. \n\nThe next morning, Dobbin stood by a huge oak tree. A fox passed by. “Hey there,” he said to the horse, “why so glum? You look like you’ve lost your best friend!” “I did!” neighed Dobbin. “He said I was too old to be of worth, so I no longer have a home.” “That’s terrible,” the fox said. “Simply awful! Is there nothing you can do?” Dobbin looked up at him and said, “The farmer said I could come back to stay if I brought him a lion!”\n\n“A lion? Did he say that? I can arrange that,” the fox said. “You can? How is that possible?” Dobbin asked. The fox told the old horse his plan and ran off to find a lion. “Hey there,” the fox called to the first lion he spotted. “I just saw a fine feast. Do you want me to take you to the carcass of a horse that just died?”\n\nThe lion roared with delight and quickly followed the red fox. They went a short distance and went by a still body of Dobbin who was lying on the ground pretending to be dead. “It would be better if you can drag this fine meal into your den where you could enjoy it in peace,” the fox advised. The lion agreed.\n\n“I’ll tie the horse’s tail to you and you can drag him to your den,” said the fox. The lion stretched out on the ground and waited as the fox secured the horse to him. Before he knew it, his legs were tied tightly together as well. “Hey! What’s going on?” the lion roared. He struggled to free himself from the ropes.\n\nJust then, Dobbin rose to his feet. “Now, hurry off!” the fox said and he wished his friend well. The old horse trotted towards home dragging the angry lion behind him. “Well, look at that!” the farmer said as he watched Dobbin trotting down the lane. It was then that he remembered what a faithful servant the horse had always been. The farmer hung his head in shame.\n\nPatting the old horse on the neck, he said, “A promise is a promise! Let me cut this lion loose and you’ll be free to live in the pasture where you’ll have plenty to eat for the rest of your days!” And so, the farmer had another mouth to feed. Old Dobbin had a forever home. The lion disappeared into the forest never to be seen again."

We can come back together whenever we need the money and take out as much as we need.\"\n\n\"That is an excellent idea,\" agreed Dharmabuddhi.

But, when the summer arrived in all its vigor and the lake really went dry in due course, the owl thought of returning home. He thanked the swan for the nice company given by him and said with a heavy heart, \"Dear friend, I am leaving this place now, since the lake has gone dry and there is no water available here. I would like you too to come along with me; because you too can't live without water.\" \"Thanks,\" said the sawn, \"in fact, there is a small river that flows half a mile away from here; I shall go and stay there.

The owl perched itself on the same branch, a little away from where the swan slept.\n\nJust then a few travelers came to rest under the tree. The sun had set. It was nearly dark all around.

The peddler sold all sorts of goods....sturdy shoes for the farmers and pretty trinkets for their sweethearts, warm, woolly shawls to keep the women warm and sweet, sticky toffees for the children to munch on their way back from school.\n\nSome days he sold fruits and on other days, kettles. To carry all his wares, the peddler had a donkey. Every morning, the peddler loaded the donkey with his wares. The two would set out and walk from farmhouse to farmhouse, from village to village and from market to market.\n\nThe peddler always walked ahead, whistling merrily as he went. The poor donkey followed, trying as hard as he could to keep up with his master and groaning under the weight of his load.\n\nEvery evening, their wares sold, the peddler and his donkey would wend their way home. The peddler, pleased with the day's takings, would walk ahead, jingling the pennies in his pocket. The poor old donkey would follow, footsore and weary from carrying the heavy sacks all day long.\n\n\"Ah! My poor feet! Oooh! My aching back!\" the donkey moaned every night as he collapsed wearily onto the hay in his stable.\n\nThe old grey cat, who shared the stable with the donkey, would shake her head and sigh. 'Poor old donkey,' she would say to herself and slink off into the night.\n\nOne morning, the peddler loaded the poor donkey with a dozen sacks. The sacks were full of salt and much heavier than the donkey's usual load. The donkey groaned under the weight, but bore it patiently, as he had always done.\n\n\"I shall make a tidy profit today on this salt.' said the peddler to the donkey as they set off. 'There is not a woman who does not need to buy salt for her cooking and they will pay me well for this. I shall be a rich man tonight!'\n\nAnd the peddler danced a little jig in the middle of the road. The donkey could only think of the heavy load on his back and the long day ahead.\n\nThe donkey plodded along behind the peddler. The sun was now high in the sky. The donkey was hot and tired and longing for a drink of water. Up ahead, he knew, a stream of cool, sweet water. The donkey hurried towards the stream as fast as his tired legs and the heavy load on his back would allow and leaned over for a drink. The edge of the stream was slippery with mud and slush. The donkey, with the heavy sacks of salt on his back, slipped and fell into the water.\n\n\"Oooh, help! Help!' brayed the donkey in terror, his legs flailing madly in the water. 'I will surely drown with this terrible load on my back!'\n\nBut suddenly, the donkey felt himself floating, the load on his back gone as if by magic. He clambered out on to the bank and shook himself. Yes! The weight on his back had vanished!\n\nOf course, the sacks were lighter, for the salt had dissolved in the water. But the donkey did not know that. 'At last! A way to rid myself of my burdens,' he thought and brayed with joy at his great discovery.\n\nThat night he told the grey cat all about how he had slipped and fallen into the stream and how, when he had climbed out, his load had become so much lighter.\n\n\"No more heavy loads for me,' declared the donkey, feeling very pleased.\n\n'Every time it gets too much for me, all I have to do is pretend to fall into a stream and my load will lessen by magic!'\n\nThe grey cat shook her head and sighed. 'Poor old donkey.' she said and slunk off into the night.\n\nThe next morning the peddler loaded the monkey again, this time with bales of cloth that he wanted to sell at the next village. Be careful today, old donkey,' he said as they set off. 'I did not earn a penny yesterday. I must earn double today or we'll go to bed hungry tonight.'\n\nThe donkey plodded along behind the peddler and groaned under the weight of the cloth. His back ached more than ever and his feet were killing him. He resolved to find a stream as quickly as he could. As luck would have it, the peddler took the same path he had taken the previous day and very soon they came to the same stream. The donkey hurried ahead as though very thirsty and pretending to slip, fell in. He kicked his legs about, making sure the bundle on his back was properly soaked.\n\nIn a moment my burden will vanish.\" he told himself and kicked about some more.\n\nBut what was happening? Something was wrong! His load, instead of becoming lighter, had become much heavier and was slowly pulling him deeper into the stream.

Help!' he cried.\n\nMeanwhile, the peddler rushed to the stream, bracing himself on the bank, helping the frightened donkey out of the water.\n\nThat night, the donkey was a sad and subdued creature.

The vessel of holy water fell down? Now, how will I carry water?” The students replied, “But Sir, you only asked us to watch the things falling off the cart, not pick them up.” The Sage said, “Oh, fools! What I meant by watch was that you should take care that nothing falls off the cart. Next time onwards, pick up everything that falls out and put it back into the cart. Is that understood?” The students agreed.\n\nThe bullock cart moved on. The sage dozed. A little while later, the bullocks dropped some dung on the ground.

Why can’t you understand simple things?” asked the sage.\n\nThe Sage was silent and thought for a while. He then came up with a very good idea. He listed out all the things in the cart and gave the list to the students saying, “Look, children, if any of the articles given in the list slips down, you must pick them up.” They moved on and the sage once again fell asleep.

      "body": "The Golden Goats:\n\nThere lived a golden goat in a deep forest. He was as big as a pony and as strong as a bull. He had two pointed horns. His golden hair shone like burning flames in the bright sunlight. Even lions and tigers were afraid of facing this goat.\n\nOnce a lion saw the goat on the outskirts of a village, eating vegetable leaves in the garden of a farmer. The farmer seeing the goat in his garden beat him with sticks. The lion thought to himself, \"How can a grass-eating animal be stronger than I.\"\n\nWhen the goat came out of the vegetable garden bleating after being beaten by the farmer, the lion pounced upon him. He killed the goat and ate it.\n\nMoral: Keep your eating habits and personal traits a secret."

He was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it.\n\nOne night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fine fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fine appearance.\n\n\"You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to,\" replied the Dog. \"Leave the woods; there you live miserably. Why, you have to fight hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will get along beautifully.\"\n\n\"What must I do?\" asked the Wolf.\n\n\"Hardly anything,\" answered the House Dog. \"Chase people who carry canes, bark at beggars, and fawn on the people of the house. In return you will get tidbits of every kind, chicken bones, choice bits of meat, sugar, cake, and much more beside, not to speak of kind words and caresses.\"\n\nThe Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost wept. But just then he noticed that the hair on the Dog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed.\n\n\"What is that on your neck?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" replied the Dog.\n\n\"What! nothing!\"\n\n\"Oh, just a trifle!\"\n\n\"But please tell me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened.\"\n\n\"What! A chain!\" cried the Wolf. \"Don't you go wherever you please?\"\n\n\"Not always! But what's the difference?\" replied the Dog.\n\n\"All the difference in the world! I don't care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price.\" And away ran the Wolf to the woods.\n\nMoral: There is nothing worth so much as liberty."

On the floor was a huge black snake with its ugly head bitten off.\n\n\"Oh, what have I done,\" cried Brahmin's wife. \"I killed that faithful little mongoose who saved the life of my precious son.\""

The forest creatures have gotten some brains into themselves so they are becoming professionals in hiding them!” the fox said to himself.\n\nOn his way back home, he saw a strong, wild boar sharpening his tusks with the help of the bark of a tree. “Whoa! I wonder why this boar is sharpening his tusks when there are no hunters around!” This fox was a bit nosy and was absolutely anxious to know why the wild boar was sharpening his tusks.\n\nThe fox thought for a while but could not get to a conclusion.

But the lion was not being entirely truthful. He was very afraid of rats, and he did not want any of the other animals to know this in case they made fun of him. There was also a little sheep who was very meek and quiet.\n\nThe sheep did not boast or brag because the sheep did not consider himself to be brave or strong or cunning. Because the sheep were so quiet, the lion often picked on him and called him names. ‘You are a frightened little animal,’ goaded the lion. ‘You are too quiet and too timid. You should be more like me.’ The gentle sheep never answered this name-calling, he simply went about his business in his usual manner.\n\n‘I may be quiet,’ thought the sheep, ‘but at least I have friends and do not spend my time boasting about myself or judging others.’ One day, when the sheep were walking through the jungle, he heard the lion screaming at the top of his voice. ‘Help me! Help me!’ The little sheep ran in the direction of the lion’s desperate cries for help until he found the mighty beast clinging to the lowest branch of a tree in a small clearing. ‘Help me, little sheep!’ pleaded the lion. ‘What is wrong?’ asked the sheep as he looked about on the ground to see what had frightened the lion in such away.\n\n‘Rats!’ exclaimed the lion, and with his tail, he pointed towards the ground where there was a family of rats searching for food at the base of the tree. The little sheep trotted up to the rats and gently pushed them away from the base of the tree. ‘Run along now,’ said the sheep, 'You are scaring the lion.' And with that, the rats all scurried off into the jungle in search of more food. When the lion was sure that the rats had gone, he dropped to the ground and tried his best to puff out his chest as if he had not been frightened at all. But the little sheep was not convinced by the lion’s bravado.\n\n‘Why is it that you are so scared of rats?’ asked the little sheep. ‘They are slithery and slimy and dirty,’ said the lion. ‘That is not true,’ protested the sheep. ‘How can you know what they are like if you have never spoken to them?' The lion thought about this for a while and eventually admitted that he had never spoken to the rats at all but had always been afraid of them. ‘You are right, little sheep,’ said the lion, ‘I decided that the rats were slithery and slimy and dirty, just as I had decided that you were timid and frightened, but it is not true.\n\nYou are brave and strong, perhaps the bravest and strongest animal in the jungle!’ The sheep thanked the lion for his kind words but admitted that this was probably not true. The two of them laughed together and the sheep had to admit that it was very funny to see the mighty lion hanging from the tree looking so scared. From that day on, the sheep and the lion became very good friends, and the lion learned from the sheep that it was best never to judge another animal by the way they looked."
