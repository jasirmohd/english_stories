      "title": "The Little Girl And Mushrooms",
      "body": "It was a fine summer morning, perfect to be outdoors. Two sisters had been out mushroom picking, and were on their home with heavy baskets full of mushrooms. They sang songs on the way, and played with each other.\n\nSoon they reached a point where they had to cross a railway track. They did not think twice about crossing it since there was no train coming, and they could not hear any whistle. They slowly climbed the embankment to cross the track, taking care not to drop the baskets. They were very near the track and the little sister was about the cross it, when they heard the distinct horn of a train.\n\nThe older sister got frightened and ran back. She thought that the young one was following her. She turned back and was shocked to see her little sister still crossing the track. \"Come back here, run back fast,\" she screamed.\n\nIt seemed that the little girl could not hear her sister. She was still concentrating on stepping over the track with her little feet, and holding on to the basket. Then she tripped and fell on the track, scattering her mushrooms around. She sat down and began picking them up and putting in her basket.\n\nIn the meanwhile the elder sister had become hysteric. She cried and screamed, calling her little sister to leave the mushrooms and run back, but it seemed as though the little one could not hear her.\n\nThe engine driver panicked on seeing the girl and blew his whistle with all his might, but she appeared not to hear the whistle. Her sister was now crying loudly, overcome by panic, as the little sister crawled between the tracks on her hands and knees, to pick the rest of the mushrooms.\n\nThe engine driver was helpless as it was not possible for him to stop the engine suddenly. He blew the whistle as hard as he could, but the engine rolled over the little girl. The older sister clasped her face with her trembling hands and cried bitterly. The passengers too panicked at the thought of the sight they would have to witness. The guard ran down to the end of the train to see what happened to the little girl. When the train passed, everybody saw her lying very still between the tracks with her face down.\n\nThen she raised her head, sprang to her knees and began gathering the remaining mushrooms.\n\nThe big sister ran towards her, tears streaming down her face. They hugged and kissed each other, crying out of happiness, tears of joy flowing down their little cheeks. Never were two souls so happily united as at that moment. She promised her little sister that thereafter she would hold her hand tightly while crossing the railway line.\n\nThe two sisters then picked all the remaining mushrooms, and hand in hand, solemnly walked back home. They were indeed two souls who had become wiser than their years, in the span of a few minutes.\n\n"

      "title": "The Day Walk Made a Friend",
      "body": "Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful and extremely amiable girl named, Walk. She was a good girl, but she never liked her name as all the kids around her made fun of her name. She ran away from everybody who teased her name and hence, Walk never really had friends. She would play alone all the time.\n\nOn a regular day, when Walk returned home from school, she finished her homework as soon as possible and asked her mother, if she could go out and play. Her mother said yes, but warned her to not wander and go far away from home.\n\nWalk was happy that day; she went to her favorite spot near the river running just behind her house. Walk had this theory that wherever the river was splashing and moving, it meant that the river water was taking to her. Walk spoke back to the river in her own little weird way.\n\nToday, when talking to the river, she said, \"You are so fortunate river, as you get to travel different places and always be with your friends- ducks, turtles, fishes, and plants. I wish I had more friends and wouldn't be alone anymore.\"\n\nWhen she was bored talking to the river, she would pick up stones from nearby and try to skip them across the river like her dad. However, she would fail most of the times.\n\nShe would then say to the river, \"I am getting better each day. I am more of a thrower than a skipper.\" After many attempts at skipping rock, she finally finds a perfect rock, almost round, flat, and protruding at one end where she could hold and skip it in water.\n\nShe held the stone tight in her fingers, and innocently said to the river, \"Oh dear river, If only I could skip this rock and make a wish, I would wish for a dear friend just like you, and if the rock skips all the way across you while wishing, I wouldn't be as lonely as I am now.\" Saying this, Walk whipped her arm back just like her dad had taught her and skipped the rock across the river with full force and dedication.\n\nShe watched the rock skip once, twice, thrice, and she kept wishing for a friend while counting. To her amazement, the rock went on skipping for the fourth, fifth and sixth time, and eventually on the seventh skip, it finally made it across the river on to the shore of the opposite side. Walk was totally taken aback. She had been holding her breath so hard and wishing so desperately that when the stone skipped the river and landed across she could not just believe her eyes.\n\nHer deep thoughts and sheer happiness were disturbed when she heard footsteps coming her way. Walk immediately came to senses and started looking around. A little girl was tumbling down towards her. Walk panicked and started to run but she lost her balance and she fell off too. Rolling down towards the river, the unknown little girl and Walk fell almost on the same spot beside each other.\n\nThe tumbling girl was crying profusely and endlessly holding on to her knee. Walk pulled herself together and went close to the girl to help her. Walk saw that the girl's knee was bleeding. She said the calmest words to her, \"It will be alright, I will help you clean the wound.\" Walk took some water from the river, washed away the blood from the wound, tore a piece of cloth from her skirt, and tied it around the wound on the knee to cover the cut. She politely said to the girl, \"My house is nearby, let me help you, my mother will take care of the wound.\"\n\nWalk helped the girl walk until her house. Once they both had reached Walk's house, Walk called out to her mother, \"Mother, there is a girl with me and she fell down by the river. Her knee is cut and there is blood all over her dress.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Walk's mother came running out of the kitchen with the first-aid box. She made the little girl sit on a couch and started cleaning the wound. She cleaned her knee with an antiseptic and applied colorful bandages to lighten up the girl's face. She then enquired the girl asking her where she lived. The girl promptly told Walk and her mother that she had just moved in a house probably next door. All the houses looked so similar that she mixed up the one she lived in. Walk gasped and felt a hint of joy think about her wish.\n\nThe little girl looked at Walk and asked, \"What is your name?\" Walk was stunned and scared to tell her name because she did not want the girl to make fun of her name like other kids. However, Walk's mother replied, \"Her name is Walk and I am glad she could help you.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the little girl began to laugh and almost happen to fall on the ground. Walk felt the pinch and she was on the verge of breaking into tears. Walk closed her eyes, and said to herself, \"Is this the friend I get in return for my wish?\" Just then, the girl stopped laughing and voluntarily said, \"I am sorry for my manners, but it is absolutely funny as my name happens to be Run.\"\n\nWalk gave a surprised look to her new friend and almost broke into laughter herself. Just to make sure she asked Run whether her name was seriously \"Run,\" and she was not trying to make fun of her. Run reassuringly said to Walk, \"You helped me and wiped my wound, why would I ever lie to you or even make fun of you.\"\n\nListening to these words, Walk felt tremendous happiness and was filled with joy. Her wish to the river had come true, and now she had a very good friend named Run.\n\nWalk would never forget that day. It was the day Walk and Run became the best of friends forever.\n\n"

      "title": "The Friendship of a Lion and a Mouse",
      "body": "There lived a tiny mouse in a big dense forest that was always in search of food. While searching in the forest, one day, it came near a lion's den. The good smell coming from the lion's den drew the little mouse inside it. The mouse found several pieces of animal meat on the floor. Those were all the leftovers of the animal the lion had eaten. Therefore, the mouse ate few pieces.\n\nLater, it decided to eat the other pieces at night, so it stayed back in the den. Due to over eating, the mouse fell asleep inside the den. The lion returned to its den at dark but could not see the sleeping mouse as it was dark inside the den. The lion ate the entire piece of lamb it had brought and left the bones lying on the floor. After a sumptuous filling meal, the lion slept off and started snoring aloud.\n\nThe loud snoring sounds woke the mouse up with a sudden jerk. When the mouse saw the lion sleeping in the den, he got scared and puzzled, and accidentally bumped in to the lion's leg.\n\nThe mouse felt the smooth fur of the lion's body. While exploring it, the mouse reached the lion's ear and this led to waking up the lion. The disturbed lion, agitated, snorted loudly. \"Who is it?\"\n\nThe frightened mouse declared his identity with a feeble voice. The lion was furious as it got disturbed during his sleep. So he said, \"How dare you disturb my sleep and where are you?\"\n\nWhen the mouse responded, the lion had to light up a lamp as it was very dark inside the den and he could not possible see a tiny creature like a mouse.\n\nWith the light, the lion looked at his clean den. It was devoid of any bones or leftover meat. Moreover, there was no usual stink in the den due to the animal leftover meat and other stuff. He was quite amazed.\n\nIn one corner, the lion looked at the petty little mouse. The mouse was shivering with fear. So the lion pondered for a while about how the mouse had managed to keep the den clean. Therefore, he decided that he would keep the mouse in his den so that it can have the leftover meat and bones. That much food will be more than sufficient for the mouse and this will also keep his den stink-free and tidy.\n\nThen the lion in a grumpy and angry voice asked the mouse, \"Why have you entered my den?\" Petrified, the mouse retorted with folded hands and honestly told the lion that he had reached the den in search of food. He could not resist the good smell of the meat and was extremely sorry for his action. Hence, the mouse apologized and asked the lion to let him go.\n\nThe lion told the mouse that he could stay in the den only if he allowed the lion to sleep properly. The mouse was too scared and did not understand what the lion meant. He kept begging the lion to leave him.\n\nLooking at the terrified mouse, the lion lowered his voice and said in soft tone, \"Oh tiny mouse do not be scared and frightened. Just listen to me carefully. I go hunting every day and bring the carcass of some animal as part of my daily meal. I do not eat it completely. You are a small and tiny animal and hence you can easily eat the leftovers and make yourself happy. If you like eating the leftovers without searching for food, you can stay here and help me keep this place clean.\"\n\nThis revealed the soft and humble side of the lion's gigantic character.\n\nThe mouse was taken aback with unlimited joy. To this he said, \"Yes Mr. Lion, I shall stay in the den.\"\n\nHowever, the lion put forth one simple condition for the mouse. The lion said that he would have to keep the den clean. The mouse can eat the leftover meat and bones. If the mouse failed to complete the leftovers, he must throw the remaining away from the den. So the task of cleanliness of the den was given to the mouse in exchange of his stay and food. The mouse was more than happy to accept the offer.\n\nAfter this short but sweet conversation, the lion asked the mouse to sleep in the corner of the den and he himself slept in the middle of the den. So as the mouse and the lion lay fast asleep in the den, the mouse suddenly started rolling freely on the floor of the den. Rolling on the floor while asleep happened to be a sleeping disorder the mouse had and he was completely unaware about this habit. So he kept rolling and by midnight, he came closer to the lion's body. As soon as the mouse came closer to the lion's body, he felt the warmth of the lion's fur and this helped him sleep deep and in a more comfortable manner. So, in his sleep the mouse wanted to feel more cozy and comfortable. So, the mouse unknowingly adjusted himself in the fold of the lion's huge leg.\n\nOwing to his humble nature, the lion felt fine with this and he even adjusted his leg so that the mouse can sleep peacefully. When the sunrays of the early morning fell on the lion's eyes, he woke up. The lion saw that the mouse was fast asleep on his leg. After watching the mouse sleep so calm and peacefully, the lion gently woke the mouse up, as he had to get up. While the lion pushed his paw, the mouse woke up. Seeing the lion's nose so close up, the little creature was extremely terrified and tried to jump off.\n\nHowever, the lion helped the mouse get down and prevented the mouse from hurting himself. After this kind gesture, the mighty lion asked the mouse to be not frightened and told him the reason why the mouse had to wake up; it was because he was sleeping on the lion's leg. After hearing this, the frightened mouse started laughing vigorously. Seeing his friend laugh, the lion broke into pangs of laughter too.\n\nThis was the onset of a beautiful bond of friendship between the tiny mouse and the mighty lion.\n\n"

      "title": "The Jackal and the Foolish Tiger",
      "body": "One night, the jackal, decided to leave the forest and visit the neighboring village. There he happened to meet a bitch and fell in love with her. Soon, the bitch became pregnant. Her delivery date was fast approaching, and the jackal grew increasingly nervous. So, they left to the forest which he felt, was safer. He warned the human beings in the village could take away the pups.\n\nThe bitch thought this was good advice, and they decided to leave for the forest. The couple reached the forest and the jackal went searching for a safe place. He found an abandoned den of a tiger, and felt the cave was a perfect shelter for the pups.\n\nThe jackal told the bitch, \"This cave is the best place to stay and that nobody would disturb us here\".\n\nBut his wife said, \"This is the tiger's cave and he will kill us if he finds out.\"\n\nThe jackal assured her and told her that he will attend to the tiger.\n\nThey began organizing and the jackal brought some hay, so they could sleep comfortably. Suddenly, they heard a tiger's roar. The jackal looked outside, and noticed a tiger at the cave's entrance. The bitch became scared, and began to weep.\n\nThe jackal consoled her, and said in a loud voice, \"Don't worry my dear, I know that you are hungry and tired. The tiger will soon come in to his den, and we can then kill it and, satisfy your hunger.\" He intentionally spoke loudly, so the tiger could overhear their conversation.\n\nNo sooner the foolish tiger heard the jackal's plans, he ran away. He thought there were two wild animals in his den, waiting to kill and eat him. The fleeing tiger, came across another jackal, who was aware of the first jackal's state of affairs. He also knew the first jackal had brought his wife from town, and taken over the tiger's cave.\n\nThe second jackal was jealous of the first jackal, and his wife, and started laughing at the foolish tiger. The scheming second jackal, told the tiger of the first jackal's plans.\n\nHe advised the tiger, \"Don't be afraid; just follow me.\"\n\nThe foolish tiger thought for a while and decided to follow the second jackal. The second jackal, reassured the tiger, and praised his size and strength. He asked the tiger to go to his den and see for himself.\n\nBy this time, the tiger had regained his confidence and was seething in anger.\n\nHe remarked \"How can they stay in my den without permission? I am going to kick them out and kill them.\"\n\nHearing this, the second jackal became happy.\n\nSoon, they reached the tiger's den. The first jackal, noticing the tiger had returned to the den with his foe, the second jackal.\n\nThe first jackal was shrewder than both the tiger and second jackal.\n\nHe spoke in a loud voice, \"Don't worry my dear, one of my comrades have brought back the tiger. My comrades are hiding in the forest. They will surely catch him this time. He has fallen into our trap, and his flesh would last us some time. This would give you the energy for your delivery.\"\n\nOn hearing the conversation, the foolish tiger, who had returned only because of the second jackal's persuasion, turned and ran. His retreat was so hasty, that he fell down a couple of times and injured himself. He also cursed himself for trusting the second jackal.\n\nThe second jackal had followed the tiger and he too was a bit stressed.\n\nWhile the tiger was resting, the second jackal cautiously approached him and said, \"I am sorry that you had to run\". He is a rogue and I never thought, you were such a coward. You, the mightiest animal in the jungle is afraid of one silly jackal!\".\n\nThe tiger said, \"I am fed up and I won't go there again. You jackals are all one group. Your aim is to destroy all the tigers, so you can move freely in the jungle\".\n\nThe jackal meekly replied, \"I am your humble servant, and I don't like the way, one of my comrades behaved with you. I know he and his wife need a place, but not at the cost of your den. You know that a jackal is no match for a tiger. You can kill him with one stroke. This should be an example for others. Be bold, and come with me. You can also tie my tail with yours, so if you need to flee, I will hold you back.\"\n\nThe foolish tiger agreed and approached the den again.\n\nThe bitch hearing their footsteps began to howl with fear. Her husband peeped out and noticed the tiger and the second jackal approaching. He consoled his wife, and spoke in a loud voice; \"I know you are hungry and that is why you are howling. Please wait for a moment. My faithful brother is bringing back the foolish tiger. He has also tied his tail with his, so the tiger cannot escape. Soon, you can have the entire tiger.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the tiger lost his confidence and bolted. He believed the second jackal was out to trick him.\n\nSo he ran and turned for his life. The tiger ran so fast and was injured in many places. Finally, a rock fell on his head and he died. The jackal also died because he too was tied to the tiger's tail.\n\nA wise and clever person can do through wisdom, which a physically strong person may not be able to do through his physical strength.\n\n"

      "title": "The Tale of the Foolish Gardener",
      "body": "At the border of a forest, a landlord had a big garden, which he liked very much. As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\n\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\n\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\n\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\n\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\n\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\n\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\n\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\n\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\n\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\n\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\n\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\n\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\n\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them. Because of this, most of the plants lost their roots in this process and started drying up.\n\nThe next day, the landlord came out for a stroll in his favorite garden, and noticed that all his plants had been uprooted, and that they were drying up. He immediately summoned for the gardener. The frightened gardener told the landlord what had happened, and this made the landlord very angry and he immediately dismissed the gardener from his job.\n\nAs a result of his foolish act, the gardener lost his job!\n\n"

      "title": "The Tale of the Magic Box",
      "body": "Once upon a time, in a faraway land there lived a farmer with his two sons. He worked hard and looked after his farm, his cattle, and orchard regularly. He did not take a break and toiled with his laborers throughout the year. It was little wonder that he had fields finest in the village. His cattle and sheep were the best in the village. Choicest fruits and vegetables grew in his garden and orchard.\n\nDuring the monthly fair, where all village folks met to sell their wares, his was the best of the lot. His neighbors envied and said, \"There goes Manohar, his sons are fortunate to have him as a father. They are going to inherit all this when he dies\".\n\nManohar had two sons. The elder one was Ravi and the younger Hari. However, Manohar what could do with his farm, his land and his cattle, he could not do with his sons. They were not interested in following their father's footsteps. Ravi was a warrior and was more interested in arms and fighting, while Hari liked music and the fiddle.\n\nManohar secretly wished, \"I wish I had a son who loved farms more than arms and one who liked cattle better than fiddle\". He worried about what will happen to his lands, but decided he had to go with what he had, and hoped for the best.\n\nOne day, he asked his sons, \"What is it that you want to do in life?\"\n\nRavi was quick to reply, \"I want to join the army. I want to serve the country and make you proud\".\n\nHari seemed not so sure about what he wanted to do. \"Well, I like music, and I may become a musician, but think I will have to practice harder\".\n\nOkay\" the farmer said. \"Ravi, you go and join the army, and fulfill your wish\".\n\nThen he turned to Hari. \"You too can work towards your dream but meantime, help me with my work as well\".\n\nSo Ravi left and Hari stayed back with his father, occasionally helping him in his daily chores but mostly dreaming about his musical future.\n\nLife went on but one day Manohar fell ill and there was nothing that anybody could do to help him. On his deathbed, he called Hari and told him, \"Take good care of everything son, remember you are looking after your brothers share too, give it back to him intact, when he return from his duty\".\n\nThose were his last words, and Manohar died leaving everything he had in Hari's care.\n\nHari kept his father's words close to his heart, and started on his life as a farmer. Nevertheless, as time went on, he began falling back to his old, carefree ways. He thought, \"The lands have given good crops till now, the cattle and sheep has grown and prospered well, and trees have never stopped giving sweetest fruits, so why worry? There are laborers to look after them who have been doing this for long so they will continue to do so\". He began enjoying his newfound status as master and followed his wishes more vigorously.\n\nHowever, hoping for things to take care of themselves was too much to ask. Once left by themselves, laborers stopped giving their best, which meant crops weren't looked after, cattle was unattended, fruits ripened and fell down from the tree, but never reached markets on time. Thieves stole his cattle while pests and small birds made merry on the unmanned farms. The guards themselves turned to stealing as they found the opportunity too tempting.\n\nHari was oblivious to everything, lost in his world and music. The money his father left was getting him through the days and there was no shortage of friends and well-wishers while that lasted. But all things if not growing, have to come to an end. One night, it finally dawned upon Hari, when his father came to him in a dream.\n\n\"Remember my last words, son, remember to give your brother his share, or more if possible\" was all he said. Hari was relieved his father did not scold him for being careless, but once out of bed; he went to take stock of his brother's share. That soon turned to panic, as he learned about the real situation. The farm was nowhere near what it was, when his brother left, and he had nothing, no money or accounts to show him. He thought, \"What will he think? He may even send me to jail. And no one can blame him for that also\". Panic turning to fear, he approached his friends and well-wishers from the village. But they laughed him off, and said \"He hasn't come back till now, maybe he won't ever, why worry, enjoy\".\n\nBut Hari wasn't sure of that. He did not want his brother dead and he wanted him to come back. The thought of showing him the real situation made him panic, and he was running around in the village. His neighbours and others were having a good laugh at him, \"We warned you so many times. You did not look after your farm, and you always dismissed us, so now suffer!\" Nobody came forward to help him and they were all happy at his misery, and he couldn't blame them also for his own wrong doings.\n\nThere was one shepherd boy in the crowd, who was considered a simpleton by everybody. But only he gave something which seemed like a solution to Hari. The boy said, \"Master, why don't you go to the old lady on the mountains, who can do magic. Who knows she may bring your lost fortunes back through magic\".\n\nFor once, Hari took serious notice of the shepherd boy and climbed up the mountain. The old woman lived in a cave like house, too old to even move around, but her ears seem alright, she listened to his whole story. \"Please help me, old woman, bring my fortunes back, I will ever be grateful\" Hari pleaded.\n\nThe old woman took time to think, then went inside, and when she came back she had a small box in her hand, with a tiny hole on top. The box was locked and welded with brass strips. She handed the box to Hari and said, \"Everyday, before sunrise, shake one grain of magic dust on all corners of your land, and watch the magic happening\".\n\nHari's relief was beyond words. He took the magic box, thanked the old woman and quickly left for home. Next day he woke up, earlier than he had ever done and went with the box to the fields and started the routine as the lady said. But while doing it, he noticed the crops were half uncut in the fields. He also noticed the cut ones had not been taken inside or properly dried, and his laborers were sleeping comfortably.\n\nBeginning to get angry, Hari woke them up and sent them off to fields, with instructions to do their job properly. He repeated the same routine in the cattle sheds and orchards, Hari had to shout them off the beds, and chase them to start on their duties. Laborers were shocked and whispered to each other, \"The Master in the field? Now God saves us!\"\n\nThis routine was repeated every day. Hari went on shaking his magic dust in fields, and his laborers had to keep up with him. Every day, he found items that were left unattended and made sure it was taken care of. He was waiting for the magic to happen, but unknowingly he was making it happen. Within time, his farm, orchards and cattle began to prosper and seemed well on the way to the state when his father was alive.\n\nUnfortunately, his brother never came returned. He may have been killed in the war, but the good times came back for Hari. He got married to a good girl and had two sons. Time passed and while on his deathbed, he asked his sons to open the magic box he believed in so much which brought his good days back.

      "title": "The Clever Jackal Who Was Too Wily",
      "body": "One day a clever jackal was wandering about in the forest in search of food. He had not eaten for three days and was extremely hungry. He knew, if this went on for another day, he may die. Therefore, he sat and thought of an idea on how to get some food.\n\nHe was aware that a farmer named Joseph, had a sugarcane field on the border of the forest. Joseph's sugarcane fields had grown and he was planning to harvest them. He had fenced the boundaries of the farm so wild animals would not invade and destroy the sugarcane. Joseph had built a small tree house, so he could stay up there and watch the farm at night.\n\nOne night as he was sitting on his tree house, the clever jackal approached him. He told the farmer, \"Dear Sir, your farm is soon going to be invaded by a huge elephant. There was shortage of food in the forest, so the big elephant living in the forest had decided to invade his farm. So be ready with your weapons.\"\n\nJoseph got worried hearing the Jackal's advise. He had put so much effort in the farm and it would be a pity if the sugarcane fields were destroyed. He was left with no choice, but to take his bow and arrows and lay in wait for any intruders.\n\nAfter visiting Joseph, the clever jackal went to the elephant. The elephant was grazing near a pond. The jackal went up to him and asked, \"Dear Sir, it appears that you are not getting enough food to feed yourself. The problem is that you are a vegetarian and that you eat only a select lot of plants.\"\n\nThe elephant replied, \"You are right. I cannot eat all plants and am forced to travel from forest to forest, in search of food. It is a tedious task and there are days I even go without food. However, this forest is a bit better than the rest.\"\n\nThe clever jackal smiled to himself and said, \"I have some good news for you. There is a place where you can feast for at least one week.\"\n\n\"That's interesting. Please tell me more about it,\" said the elephant.\n\nThe jackal told the elephant all about Joseph's sugarcane fields. He added the harvest was to take place tomorrow or the day after. The sugarcane fields are ripe and will be a real feast for you.\n\nThe Jackal added, \"He has fenced it, but the fence is no match for your might. You can go there tonight and feast until you are full. So don't miss this opportunity.\"\n\nThank you for providing me with this information. \"I shall go there in the evening and creep in at midnight, when the farmer is asleep,\" said the elephant. \"That is a great idea, as Joseph sleeps like a log.\"\n\nThe Jackal then visited the boundary of the field, where a huge and ancient oak tree stood, and was home to many animals. Joseph was standing close to the next tree and it appeared he was making plans for the night. \"What are you doing here\", asked the Jackal.\n\nJoseph replied, \"I am searching for a place where I can have a clear shot at the elephant.\"\n\nThe jackal then advised Joseph to stand under the nearby old oak tree as it had a great view. He added that he could also stand behind the oak tree and the elephant will not be able to see him.\n\nJoseph was happy at the jackal's advise, as he too had thought the same. Therefore, he decided to go to his hut, have an early supper and return.\n\nThe wily jackal then went to the oak tree. He was aware that a snake was staying on the base of the tree. He called out to the snake and told him, \"Dear Sir, you are in great danger. The farmer, who owns the sugarcane field, plans to kill you tonight. Have you ever seen him?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! Isn't his name Joseph?\"\n\n\"Well, he has decided to destroy you and your family because you are a nuisance to his livestock\", said the jackal.\n\n\"What shall I do my dear jackal? He is big and always carries weapons.\"\n\nThe jackal said, \"Don't worry, he plans to come here tonight and will be hiding behind the tree. Before he can react, go and bite him twice or thrice and that will be the end of Joseph\".\n\nThe jackal wished him success and bade good-bye. He was sure that his plan would work and if all goes well, he would have a dead elephant, man, and snake by the next day. That should be enough meat for a month and a half.\n\nThe elephant as planned slowly entered the sugarcane fields at midnight. The farmer noticing the elephants took out his bow and arrow, and shot three arrows at the elephant. The elephant cried in pain and fell. Joseph got down from the tree and no sooner he stepped down, he felt a sharp pain on his ankles. He felt as if an insect had bitten him a couple of times. Looking down, he saw a snake slithering away. Quickly, he raced after it and trampled it, and the snake was dead. Shortly, Joseph too fell down and died. The elephant also had died by now.\n\nThe jackal slowly ventured close to the hunter. He noticed the bow lying next to the hunter. He bit it to remove it from the way and in the process cut the bowstring. The tension in the string was so much that the sharp end of the bow entered the jackal's throat and that was the end of the wily jackal.\n\nMoral: Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.\n\n"

      "title": "The Tale Of The Rabbit And The Thief",
      "body": "Long time ago, the rabbit was regarded as a big hunter. He lived with his grandma in a cabin somewhere in the woods. It was winter and just like other hunters, the rabbit set traps and snares to catch other animals for food. He got number of such small animals and birds through his well-laid snares.\n\nHowever, one day he realized that someone was stealing the animals from his traps. Every morning at the crack of dawn, he went to check his traps, and he found them empty. Soon the rabbit and his grandma became ravenous due to lack of food.\n\nAt first, the rabbit was under the impression that the thief might be a clever wolf. However, this thought soon changed, when he discovered one morning, long, narrow footprints beside his traps. The first thought that came into the mind of the rabbit was that of the thief. However, when examined closely, the tracks appeared to be moonbeams. Since then, the rabbit woke up an hour earlier hoping to catch the thief. However, the thief was always a few minutes ahead of him, and had taken all the trapped animals.\n\nThe rabbit then laid a cunning trap with a bowstring, and he was sure that he would catch the thief. He kept one end of the string and hid behind the bushes, so that he could watch if any animal was caught in his traps. There was a full moon when he set the trap up. Suddenly, the moon disappeared and everything became dark. There were a couple of stars that were sparkling and there was no mist in the sky. The rabbit began to ponder what had happened to the moon.\n\nThe rabbit then saw something move stealthily through the trees, and was suddenly blinded by a flash of brilliant white light. The light went straight to the trap that he had set. At once, the rabbit tugged on the end of the bowstring and tried to tighten the noose. There was a struggle and the rabbit immediately knew that he had caught the thief.\n\nThe rabbit quickly fastened the bowstring to a nearby tree and rushed home. He wanted to tell his grandma what had happened.\n\nThe grandma, a wise old rabbit, told him, \"Rush back immediately, and find out who you have captured.\"\n\nThe rabbit said, \"Now that I have caught the thief, I shall wait till daylight before returning.\"\n\nHowever, his grandma cautioned him and said, \"It might be too late by then, so return now.\"\n\nSo the rabbit returned to his trap to find out who the thief was.\n\nHowever, when he reached his trap, the rabbit saw that the bright light was still present. The light was so bright that it hurt his eyes. Therefore, he went to the nearby brook to wash his eyes and cool them. The he made huge snowballs and threw it at the light to put it out. However, no sooner, it hit the light, they fizzled out. Next, the rabbit took some dirt from the stream and made some mud balls. Then he threw these mud balls with all his strength at the bright light. He was a decent shot and as soon as it hit the light, his prisoner yelled.\n\nAt that point, a strange and unusual voice inquired, \"Why am I trapped and subjected to this humiliation. I demand that I be set free at once. I am the man from the moon and must be home before daylight.\"\n\nThe rabbit went closer and noticed that his prisoner's face had been dirtied with all the mud balls that the rabbit threw at him.\n\n\"I shall kill you and the entire rabbit tribe, if I am not set free,\" threatened the moon.\n\nThe rabbit was terrified to the point that he rushed back to inform his grandma about his strange and interesting prisoner. Although a wise, old rabbit, she too got afraid when she heard her grandson's tale.\n\nShe advised her grandson, \"Go quickly to the spot and release your prisoner at once, or all the rabbits will be in danger.\"\n\nThe rabbit returned, and told the moon man, \"I will set you free, but there is one condition.\"\n\nThe moon man was angry, yet asked the rabbit, \"Tell me what you want, you silly animal.\"\n\nThe rabbit told the moon-man, \"Promise me that you shall never return and steal from my traps.\"\n\n\"There is one more precondition,\" said the rabbit.\n\n\"Be quick with it, you stupid animal,\" said the moon-man.\n\n\"Promise me that you will never return to earth,\" asked the rabbit.\n\nThe moon-man agreed to both the conditions.\n\nThe rabbit could scarcely see in the amazing light, in spite of which he somehow chewed through the bowstring and set the moon-man free. The moon soon disappeared, leaving a flash of light behind him.\n\nThe bright light had almost blinded the rabbit and his shoulders were severely singed. Even today, rabbit's eyes flicker as if the light is too strong for their eyes. Their eyelids are pink, and their eyes water if they stare at a bright light for some time. Their lips and nose jerk, recounting the rabbit's dread.\n\nSince that day, the man from the moon has always stayed away from the earth. Whenever he lights the world, one can see the signs of the mud that the rabbit threw on his face. At times, he vanishes for a couple of nights, when he is attempting to rub the signs of the mud balls from his face. At that point, the world is dark.\n\nHowever, when the moon man returns, one can see that he has never possessed the capacity to clean the mud marks from his sparkling face.\n\n"

Although, they had a lot of cultural differences in life, Dolly managed everything to perfection.\n\nThe latest worry about Dolly was that she was losing her hearing. Sammy was worried that due to aging, Dolly was gradually losing her hearing capacity.\n\nIt happened one day, when Sammy was in the living room and asked for a cup of tea from Dolly.

      "body": "Bernardo Visconti, the despot of Milan was in his day more feared than any other ruler was. Although he was pitiless, there was always a shade of justice in his cruelty.\n\nThis is the story of a wealthy man and owner of one of the castles given to him by Bernardo. He was well known for his miserliness. One instance he was summoned to the court for having failed to feed his bullmastiffs (dogs), which had become vicious and attacked cattle. Therefore, he was condemned by Bernardo to pay a fine of four florins (gold coins). Upon hearing the amount, the miser begged for forgiveness.\n\nBernardo patiently listened to his story, until he had ended his plea. He then said, \"If you can answer the four questions, that I will ask you, I shall remit the four florins.\n\nSo saying, Bernardo listed out the four questions.\n\n1. What is the distance between here and the heavens?\n\n2. How much water is in the sea?\n\n3. What is the situation in hell at his very moment?\n\n4. And last of all, how much is my person worth?\n\nBernardo then looked sternly into the eyes of the miser and said that he had time until tomorrow morning, to answer these questions. So be careful, before answering them.\n\nThe miser became depressed, as he had absolutely no clue to any of these questions. Deep in thought, he returned to his castle, sighing deeply at his plight. He found his butler waiting for him, to whom he narrated his plight. Even the great Socrates or Aristotle will not be able to answer these questions.\n\nThe butler, who was blessed with sufficient intelligence, told him, \"Don't worry. Have your supper and get an early sleep.\"\n\nThe butler further added, \"I will have something for you by tomorrow morning. I relish such challenges. I will just shave off my beard, put on your clothes, and present myself before Bernardo, tomorrow morning. I am sure that he will not notice the difference.\"\n\nThe following day, the butler dressed up as the miser and presented himself at the court. Bernardo was in a good mood and had asked all the courtiers to be present. He was eager to find out how the miser would respond to his four questions.\n\nThe butler pulled his cape round his read and covered the bottom half of his face with a scarf, as it was cold. The room was also not well lit and this further helped the butler, as he was not recognized.\n\nBernardo thundered, \"Do you have the answers to the four questions?\n\nThe butler in guise of the miser calmly replied, \"Yes, my lord, I do have answers to all the questions. Bernardo was a bit taken aback.\n\nThe butler carried on, \"You first asked me to calculate the distance between here and the heavens. Having studied all distances, I have found out that the distance is 35,765,875.50 miles and 19 feet.\n\nBernardo, looked at him and said, \"Your conclusion seems to be very accurate. But can you prove it?\"\n\nThe butler in the guise of the miser said, \"I would appreciate if you could have the distance measured by your esteemed scientists, and if this figure is wrong, you can very well hang me.\"\n\n\"Okay, please proceed to the next question\", said the pleased Bernardo.\n\nThe butler in the guise of the miser said, \"The next question was how much water was in the sea?\"\n\nHe went on to add, \"I must confess that this is a rather difficult question. Because water is never stagnant, as there are rivers constantly flowing into the sea. However, on an average, I have managed to establish that there are 26,298,000,000 casks, 8 barrels, 12 pitchers, and 3 glasses of water in the sea.\"\n\nBernardo, could not conceal his smile and he asked, \"Are you certain about this?\"\n\nThe butler replier, \"I have computed this to the best of my ability. If you feel there is an error in my judgment, have it measured by your team of scientists and mathematicians. If I am wrong, please feel free to have me quartered.\"\n\nBernardo, although a little taken aback, was extremely surprised at the man's presence of mind. He decided to keep a careful eye for the third question.\n\nThe butler as the miser continued, \"Your lord, may I proceed to the third question? \"Of course, please do,\" said Bernardo.\n\nThe butler said, \"You wanted to know what is being done in hell at this very moment. Well, the devil and his associates are torturing, cutting, quartering, and hanging people just as you are doing in this city of Milan. You may wonder how I know this. Because, I know a man who has been there and returned and revealed this to Dante, the Florentine. The man is now dead, but if you don't believe me, please send for him.\"\n\nBernardo was truly amazed, but more amused at the man.\n\nBefore Bernardo could regain his composure, the butler went on to the last question. He said, \"As to the value of you person, I would say that you are worth 29 pieces of silver. Hearing this, Bernardo, flew into a rage.\n\nFor a moment, the butler was scared. However, he quickly regained composure and said, \"My lord, please listen to my reasoning. You know that our lord was sold for thirty pieces of silver. Therefore, I reason that you are one less than our lord and hence the twenty nine pieces of silver.\"\n\nThe answers were so ingenious and clever that it dawned on Bernardo, that this could not be the wealthy and ignorant miser. He rose and shouted, \"You are not the real offender.\"\n\nThe butler was scared to bits. He threw himself at the feet of Bernardo and confessed the whole truth. The tyrant, listened to the whole story and said, \"You are worth much more than your master. Since he made you wear his clothes, and asked you to behave like a lord and nobleman, henceforth, you will be the lord of the castle. He shall be your butler. You will receive all the income from the castle.\"\n\nAnd so, despite the protests of the butler, the decree was passed. The will of Bernardo was the law in Milan and woe to anyone who disobeyed him.\n\n"

      "title": "The Tale Of The Clever Peasant",
      "body": "Once upon a time in a village in Ukraine, there lived a rich landlord. He owned many farms, fields and forests. He owned so much land, that the peasants of the village treated him as their chief.\n\nThe chief however was an arrogant and petty minded man, with very little regard for the peasants and poor men who depended on him. He was greedy, very proud of his wealth and considered the peasants, poor and filthy, who smelt like dung. He would never entertain any peasant in his mansion, nor let any poor farmer come near him.\n\nThe poor farmers and peasants considered themselves fortunate, if they got a glimpse of him or had to visit the granary at his mansion to deliver goods.\n\nOne night, after a hard days' work, three poor peasants were sitting around the fire and discussing their day's work.\n\nThe first peasants proudly said, \"I saw the chief today. He rode by as I was working in the field.\"\n\nWhile the second one said, \"Well, that's nothing. I went to his granary to drop two sacks of potatoes and onions, and he was standing at the door of the mansion.\"\n\nA third peasant, who was drinking and listening to all this incessant chatter, laughed and said, \"So, what's so great about this? Anyone can see him, if he passes by.\" Then he boasted and said, \"If I want, I can go and have a meal with him at his table.\"\n\nThe other peasants laughed at him and thought he was crazy as he was the poorest among them. \"You must be drunk,\" they said in unison.\n\n\"His servants and security guards will kick you out,\" said the first peasant.\n\nThey then called the poor peasant a liar and started making fun of him.\n\nThe poor peasant got up and said, \"I am not a liar and if you want, I can prove it to you.\"\n\n\"Well, alright,\" they said. \"If you can prove what you have just claimed, we will give you four sacks of wheat and four oxen,\" said the other peasants.\n\n\"Consider the challenge as accepted,\" said the poor farmer.\n\n\"Wait, there is a catch,\" they said. \"If you don't, you will have to work for us, free, for one whole year,\" they added.\n\n\"Well, well, get the items ready, for tomorrow, I shall dine with the chief,\" said the poor peasant.\n\nThe next day, the poor peasant walked up to the chief's mansion. The security stopped him at the gate, and threatened him, if he did not leave immediately.\n\nThe poor peasant said, \"Please wait, I have some important and good news for your master, that I have to personally convey to him.\"\n\n\"That is impossible. Tell us and we shall tell the chief,\" said the guards.\n\n\"I am sorry, it's for the chief's ears only,\" said the peasant.\n\nAfter some time, one of the guards went and reported the incident to his master, the chief.\n\nThe chief was sitting at his dining table and was about to have lunch. Hearing the incident, the chief became very curious. He thought that the poor peasant was bringing him some information that would make him even richer. So he asked the guards to let the poor peasant in.\n\nThe poor peasant was let in and the chief looked at him as if he was dirt. He then asked, \"what is it the good and important news that you have for me?\"\n\nThe peasant looked around and said, \"I am sorry, it is for your ears only, so we must talk in private.\"\n\nThe chief got more curious. He dismissed his servants and asked them to lock the door behind them.\n\nOnce he was alone, the poor peasant asked the chief, \"What would be the price of a slab of gold as large as a horse's head?\"\n\nThe chief became more curious. He assumed that the peasant must have found some buried treasure, and did not want to disclose it to anybody. Since he was the chief, the poor chap must have come for protection. Otherwise, why would this stinking peasant come all this way to ask about this.\n\nThe poor farmer then said, \"If you cannot tell me, I shall go elsewhere. Besides, my wife is waiting with my lunch.\"\n\nHearing this, the chief politely asked him to stay on for lunch, and saw to that the poor farmer was treated to an excellent six-course meal, with his most expensive vodka.\n\nAfter a fine meal, the peasant relaxed for a while, while the chief asked him, \"Now go home and bring me that piece of gold and I shall give you a horse for it.\"\n\nThe peasant feigned surprise and asked, \"Which gold, my lord?\"\n\n\"The one you spoke about,\" said the chief.\n\n\"Well, I don't have it. We were talking about it at home, and my friends felt that you would be the best person to ask. And hence, I came to you,\" said the poor peasant.\n\nThe chief flew into a rage and thundered, \"Get out of my house, you blithering idiot.\"\n\nAnd the poor peasant walked out of the chief's mansion with a smile on his face, for he knew that he had won the bet with his friends.\n\n"

      "body": "A dog and a cock, who were the best of friends, decided to leave their farm as they wanted to travel and see the world.\n\nThey were curious and wanted to see what was there beyond their farm. So, they decided to leave the farmyard, and set out along the road that led to the woods, that would lead them on their path to see the world. The two friends were extremely happy about their decision to travel to see the world, and were hoping for many adventures on their way.\n\nAs night approached, the cock, searched for a place to roost as was his usual custom. He spotted a tall, hollow tree, on the border of the forest, and felt that the tree would be an excellent place for spending the night. The cock also thought that his friend, the dog could sleep inside the hollow base of the tree. And as per plan, the dog slept below, and the cock flew to one of the branches, and spent the night there. Both having found a safe and nice place to rest, they slept comfortably.\n\nAs the first glimmer of dawn approached, the cock forgot for a moment where he was. He woke up thinking that he was still at the farmyard. As it was his duty to arouse and wake the rest of the animals at the farm at daybreak, he stood tip-toes on the branch, flapped his wings, and crowed proudly. Having crowed two or three times, he suddenly realized that he was not at the farm anymore, and stopped crowing.\n\nHowever, the damage had been done, and instead of waking the farm animals and the farmer, he had awakened a fox, who was not too far in the woods.\n\nThe fox was hungry as he had not eaten anything the previous day, and was on the lookout for a prey. He saw the rooster perched high on the tree, and had rosy visions of a delicious breakfast. However, the fox noticed how high the cock was positioned, and was thinking of a plan to bring down the rooster, so as to kill him for his breakfast...\n\nHe immediately hurried to where the rooster was, and said very politely\" a humble welcome to our forest, dear sir! I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you in our forest. I am sure that we can become the best of friends.\"\n\nThe cock realizing that something was afoot, asked the fox, \"why, how can that be possible?\"\n\nThe fox very calmly told the rooster, \"Have you not heard about the new decree of peace and harmony that was recently issued by the lion, the king of the jungle.\"\n\nThe rooster replied \"no, I haven't, but what is this decree all about?\"\n\nThe fox added that the new treaty issued by the king lion, emphasizes that, all beasts, birds and every other creature in our forest, shall not hurt each other, but instead, should live in peace and universal brotherhood\".\n\nHence, we are not supposed to hunt, hurt or prey upon one another, but instead live in peace and harmony. So, please do come down and we can discuss this matter of such great importance.\n\nBy now, the rooster had realized that the cunning fox was up to something and did not say anything, but kept looking at the bottom of the tree, as if he was searching for someone.\n\nNoticing this, the fox asked the rooster, whether he had lost something or searching for someone.\n\nThe rooster replied that he was flattered to hear the new decree and requested the fox to go to the bottom of the tree and wake his friend, and convey this news to him.\n\nThe hungry and unsuspecting fox, thinking that there were other roosters down below, rushed to the tree's hollow, as advised by the rooster, and was a bit taken aback to see the sleeping dog.\n\nNoticing the dog, the fox immediately started running to the forest.\n\nThe rooster called out to the fox and said, \"Please don't go... the dog was his master's pet, and that he was also a good friend of the rooster's.\"\n\nThe rooster continued, \"I was just on my way down. We shall wait for my friend the dog, to wake up, and we shall discuss about this new treaty that the king lion has issued, and celebrate the new reign of universal peace.\"\n\nThe fox who, was already on the run said, \"I would be happy to meet and greet your friend, but I am afraid, that he may not have heard about the king lion's new treaty of peace.\"\n\nMoral: It is obvious that cunning often outfoxes itself, and that those who try to cheat others, would likely be paid in their own coin.\n\n"

One day while walking along the road, he found a broken branch lying under a tree. The rat put it in his bag to use it for his furnace in winter.\n\nHe continued his journey and came across a poor old man trying to light a fire. Around the man, were three little girls who were crying. The shrewd rat immediately offered his help to the old man.\n\nThe old man who mistook the rat's intents replied, \"Of course you can help. My children are hungry and the wood is wet. I cannot build a fire to cook their meager breakfast.\"\n\nThe rat said, \"I have some dry branches, which you can use it to make a fine blaze.\"\n\nThe thankful old man offered the rat some dough in return. The shrewd rat was happy that he got a week's supply of dough for a dry branch.\n\nHe carried on his journey and entered a pottery maker's yard. There he found two boys crying.\n\nThe rat comforted them and asked, \"What is your problem? Perhaps, I can help you.\"\n\nThe elder boy stopped crying and said, \"Our parents have gone to the village. They went to get some food and haven't returned, and we are hungry.\"\n\nThe rat said, \"Well, take this dough, and bake it. Soon you will have bread to eat.\"\n\nThe children thanked the rat and offered a pot made by their father. They said, \"We will not forget your kindness.\"\n\nThe proud rat tottered off with the pot. It was heavy, but the rat was happy at his shrewdness. He thought the exchange for the flour was a good deal.\n\nHe continued his journey and came across a farmer, milking a cow. Since he did not have pale, he was draining the milk into his shoes.\n\nThe rat said, \"You are making your milk dirty, by draining it in to your shoes. It would be better if you had a pale or a pot.\" Saying so, he offered the farmer his pot.\n\nThe farmer offered the rat some milk to drink in return. However, the rat refused it and said, \"I need a better bargain. Perhaps, you ought to give me a cow.\"\n\nThe farmed laughed at the rat's suggestion and said, \"You are a little animal. What will you do with this cow?\"\n\nThe rat said, \"Well, that's my problem. I will learn to handle the cow.\" Therefore, the farmer tied the cow's rein around the rat's neck.\n\nThe rat walked a few yards in a cocky manner and soon realized the rope was choking him. As the cow had stopped to graze, the rat had no choice but to wait. He thought, as the cow was his property; he ought to take good care of the cow. Therefore, he thought that he should follow the cow.\n\nThe whole day went by. The cow moved from one spot to another and the rat struggled to catch up. Finally, at dusk, the cow stopped by the river and rested. The weary rat gratefully sat beside him.\n\nVery soon, a wedding procession passed by and stopped to rest beside the stream. Four men were carrying the bride in a palanquin. They stopped by, and began cooking some rice, as that was all they had.\n\nThe rat seeing the predicament of the hungry bearers thought of another plan. He offered his cow to the four palanquin bearers as their supper. They laughed at the suggestion, but eventually agreed, as they were hungry. Soon, they had a huge steak, and offered a tiny piece to the rat.\n\nThe rat became angry at their offer. He explained to them about how he got the cow. He then added, \"Therefore, I will take nothing less than the bride herself.\"\n\nThe bearers realized their mistake and fled. The rat went up to the palanquin and lifted the curtain. He then told the lovely bride, \"My dear, you are mine and I shall look after you.\"\n\nThe girl giggled and followed the rat, as she was alone and frightened. They reached the rat's hole and the rat invited her to his home. Obviously, she could not get in, as the hole was tiny. Therefore, the rat said, \"Tomorrow, I shall make the hole larger. Until then, you can sleep under that plum tree.\"\n\nThe bride complained, \"I cannot sleep as I am hungry.\" The rat grumbling that all brides were a pain, went into his hole and came with a plum.\n\nThe girl looked in awe at the plum. She then said, \"You expect me to daily cook, clean the house and do other jobs for just a plum?\"\n\nThe rat shook his head in disbelief. He had not expected this from his new wife. He said, \"Tomorrow, I shall get you some delicacies from the market.\"\n\nThe next day, the mouse and the girl went to the market. They reached the palace, and there was the bride's mother, the queen waiting for at the gates. Thrilled, the queen and daughter embraced each other. The rat was fuming all this time. He told the queen, \"She is my wife now. I traded a cow for her, so she belongs to me.\"\n\nThe wise queen could scarcely hold back her laughter. She said, \"My dear son-in-law, we have been waiting for you. We have prepared a special room for you.\"\n\nDelighted, the rat followed the queen. The queen took him to the oven and asked him to go in. The rat leaped inside and \"bang,\" the oven door shut. He sat there fuming, while the queen and daughter were laughing uncontrollably.\n\nSoon the temperature became hotter and the rat's tail caught fire. He cried out loud, \"Please let me out; I shall never make a bargain again.\"\n\nOn hearing this, they let him out. He ran, his head hung in shame. The rat had learned his lesson. He never, never made another bargain.\n\nMessage: The rat thought that it was a clever rat indeed, but all his clever bargaining was only greed.\n\nMoral: Never try to push your good chances too far, or you may lose what you have.\n\n"

      "title": "The Clever Jackal And The Foolish Donkey",
      "body": "This is a short bedtime story of an aged lion who had a clever jackal for a servant. The jackal was also a bit old and he was only happy to be the lion's servant. Whenever the lion killed an animal, he would first have his fill and leave the rest for the wily jackal.\n\nIt so happened that one day the lion was very hungry and attacked a huge king elephant. The tusker got angry and injured the lion so bad that he could barely walk. Since the lion could not hunt, both, the jackal were starving. The lion asked the jackal to use his wile to try and trap some animal.\n\nThe lion told the jackal, \"Use your wile and bring me an unsuspecting animal that I could kill without much effort. Otherwise we would die starving.\"\n\nThe clever jackal thought for a while and came up with an idea. He slowly got up to search for an unsuspecting animal. He came across many animals, but it was obvious that his master, the lion, would be unable to kill them. They were either too fast and some of them were even stronger than his master, in his present condition.\n\nFinally, he saw a donkey grazing by the side of the river. The river was almost arid and the grass was mostly dry. It was evident the donkey was hungry.\n\nThe wily jackal was thrilled. He thought, \"This jack is precisely the animal that I need.\"\n\nHe quietly walked toward the donkey and greeted him. He said, \"Dear Sir, you look tired and worried. Is there anything wrong? Can I help you in any way?\"\n\nThe donkey replied, \"I am hungry and have not eaten for a few days.\"\n\nThe wily jackal quickly sympathized with him and said, \"Oh, that's terrible. Why don't you come with me to the forest? The grass is green and there is a river next to my cave. You also don't have to worry about any wild animals, because my cave is far from where the wild animals live. Besides, the smaller animals that live besides the river are very friendly.\"\n\nThe foolish donkey thought for a while and looked a bit apprehensive.\n\nThe wily jackal cautiously said, \"Your master will not find our place. There are also many animals of your kind living there. There are she-donkeys (jenny's) there, who haven't seen a male donkey (jack).\"\n\nThe lovesick jack immediately said, \"Come on, I have heard enough. Lead me to your place and let me meet my new friends.\"\n\nTogether they left for the hungry lion's den. The lion saw them approaching and was happy that he had a clever jackal for a servant. As a result, the moment they reached close to the den, the hungry lion leaped at the donkey. The lion, out of haste missed his target, landed on some rocks, and further hurt himself. The terrified donkey took to his heels.\n\nThe jackal was angry and swore at the lion, \"Impatient fool, couldn't he have waited a bit longer?\"\n\nHowever, the lion replied regretfully, \"I was so hungry that I got desperate. I did not expect that you would return so quickly. I apologize.\"\n\nThe jackal shouted at the lion, \"You couldn't kill a foolish donkey. How did you ever think of attacking a king elephant?\"\n\n\"Not to worry, I will bring him back, but be prepared this time\", said the wily jackal.\n\nThe lion was shocked, and said, \"How are you going to bring him back? He would have reached his home by now.\"\n\nThe jackal said, \"Leave that to me and don't act hasty.\" He then left in search of the donkey.\n\nHe found him, next to the river drinking. He was still breathing hard as he left the place so fast.\n\nHe said, \"You are nothing but a scheming, wily jackal. If I had not bent down, I would have been dead by now.\"\n\nThe clever jackal; started laughing so hard.\n\n\"What are you laughing at? Asked the donkey.\n\nThe jackal curbed his laughter and said, \"My dear sir, that was a she-donkey. She has been lovesick for some time now. She could not believe, when she saw you walking up the hill, and wanted you for herself. She sprang to hug you, but you fled.\"\n\nI told her that you were a shy person and she should not have acted in haste. The foolish donkey could not believe what he just heard.\n\n\"Come on, let's not waste any time. They are all waiting for you,\" said the wily jackal.\n\n\"Alright, if you say so. Lead the way, brother jackal\", said the donkey.\n\nThe lion was shocked to see the clever jackal and the foolish donkey return. However, this time, the lion did not make any mistake. He waited until the donkey reached his cave and quickly finished him.\n\nThe lion then went to freshen up before his meal and asked the jackal to keep watch. The clever jackal was ravenous and had other plans. He quickly ate the heart and ears of the donkey, before the lion returned.\n\nThe lion returned and was furious to note that the best parts were missing. He shouted at the jackal, \"Where are the other parts. Who ate them, while I was away?\"\n\nThe jackal remained calm and said, \"Do you thing that this foolish donkey had these parts. If he had them, do you think he would have ever returned?\"\n\nThe lion did not bother to further question the clever jackal, as he was ravenous, and quickly began eating.\n\nMoral: If you can hold your head in the face of disasters, then you would be able to defeat them.\n\n"

      "body": "A middle-aged man was wandering in the forest and lost his way back to his group. He was on a tour with his friends. After lunch, he decided to have a small walk. His friends had warned him not to go deep into the jungle as he might lose his way. However, he never cared to hear the advice of his friends.\n\nThe forest was so beautiful and dense. In spite of warnings, he got lost in the forest. When he turned back after a few minutes, he could see nothing but dense trees without showing the way. He was tensed and tried to walk back.\n\nHe couldn't find the way back. Suddenly he heard a mild roaring voice. Frightened by the voice, he walked back. The roar now sounded closer to him. He realized that it was a lion and could see traces of the lion.\n\nHe rushed and ran faster to save his life from the lion. He saw the lion approaching him. He swiftly climbed a huge and positioned himself comfortably on a high branch. He wasn't very sure how he climbed the tree. Parallel to the branch that he was seated, he saw a bear sleeping in another branch.\n\nLion saw the tree, the man, and the bear. He asked the bear to push the man down, as he was hungry.\n\nThe bear humbly replied, 'Dear Lion, I am sorry I cannot do that. This is my tree, my shelter. He came to me to rescue his life. I cannot let him die and never let him fall!' Hearing this, the man felt happy.\n\nThe Lion remained silent for a while. He then asked the man, 'Hey, push the bear down. I will leave you.'\n\nThe man without even thinking for a minute, tried to push the bear. However, the bear was so clever that he hanged to another branched and seated comfortably.\n\nThe Lion laughed at them and left the place.\n\nHow wicked was the man? Shame on him. The bear in fact saved his life from the ferocious lion and yet he tried to push him down...\n\nBe the bear and help someone who needs you. Don't be like the man who betrayed the bear.\n\n"

      "title": "The Tale Of How The Tiger Got His Stripes",
      "body": "Long time ago, ages ago, it was said that the tiger was like a lion without any stripes on his back, and the rabbit had a long tail.\n\nThe tiger had a big farm that need attending to, as it was overgrown with brush. Therefore, the tiger was searching for workers to clear the undergrowth.\n\nThe tiger called the animals and said, \"I am in need of a good worker to clean this place. I shall offer a buffalo in payment for whoever does this work the quickest.\"\n\nThe monkey called in first and said that he would like to do the job. So, the tiger assigned the job to him. However, the tiger, to his dismay, found out that the monkey was very slow. Therefore, the tiger fired him as quickly as he hired him.\n\nThe goat was the next on the list. Although the goat was a good worker, he could never concentrate nor focus. He would work on one part of the field and then move away to another part, without finishing the area that he was working on. As expected, the tiger fired him without any pay.\n\nThe armadillo was the next to be tried. It was the same story with the armadillo as well. He was a good worker, but the moment he saw any ants, he would stop and finish of the lot. As a result, work suffered. Therefore, he too was fired without pay.\n\nFinally, a rabbit came forward. The tiger was a bit surprised and laughed at him and said,\" how are you going to complete the work, where these animals had failed?\"\n\nAnyway, the tiger decided to try him.\n\nThe tiger was surprised to note that the rabbit was a hard worker. He quickly cleared most of the farm. Seeing his hard work, the tiger decided to take a break, and asked his son to watch over the rabbit.\n\nThe rabbit noted that the tiger had left. Therefore, he asked the tiger's son, \"Where is the buffalo that your father is going to give me? Is it kept by the side of the river?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the son.\n\nThe rabbit decided to take the buffalo, without completing the work. Just as he was leaving, the tiger entered and noticed that the rabbit was about to leave. He then ensured that he stayed until the work was complete. The work was complete and the tiger gave the buffalo to the rabbit, as promised.\n\nThe tiger then said, \"If you plan to eat this buffalo, eat it in a place where there are no mosquitoes.\"\n\nThe rabbit went away with the buffalo. After going some distance, he felt hungry and thought of butchering the buffalo. He looked around and saw there was a farm close by and mosquitoes as well. So, he decided not to kill the buffalo and went ahead a little more. Finally, he came close to a river, and there was strong breeze. He looked around and did not see any mosquitoes.\n\nAs he was about to butcher the buffalo, the tiger came along and said, \"I am very hungry, and will you share the buffalo with me.\"\n\nThe rabbit, out of fear, gave a piece of meat to the tiger, which the tiger gulped it in a moment. He then asked the rabbit, \"Is that all what you are going to give me? I am such a good friend of yours and I am sure you will give me more.\"\n\nThe rabbit, out of fear, gave more to the tiger. Soon, he had finished most of the buffalo's meat. The rabbit had managed to get only a small piece and was furious. He decided to teach the tiger a lesson.\n\nFew days passed. One day, the tiger was returning from hunting and he saw the rabbit cutting big blocks of wood. He asked the rabbit what he was doing?\n\nThe rabbit said that there were orders that every animal in the jungle has to build an enclosure or fence around themselves for protection. The tiger was surprised and said, \"This is news to me.\"\n\n\"Well, everyone is doing it,\" said the rabbit.\n\nThe tiger got a bit apprehensive and said, \"Please my good friend, won't you help in building me an enclosure?\"\n\nThe rabbit although initially hesitant, but after seeing the tiger's pleas, the rabbit eventually consented.\n\nTherefore, he quickly build a solid, wooden enclosure for the tiger and went away. It was strong and could not easily be penetrated.\n\nThe tiger was inside the barricade and after sometime felt hungry.\n\nSoon a monkey passed that away and he asked the monkey, \"Has the danger passed?\".\n\nAlthough the monkey had the faintest idea what the tiger was asking, he still replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nTherefore, the tiger asked the monkey to let him out of the enclosure.\n\n\"I cannot, as the ropes are tied securely. Ask the one who put you inside to come and let you out,\" said the monkey.\n\nSoon the goat came along, and then the armadillo and other animals and all of them had the same answer.\n\nSoon, the tiger realized that he had been tricked. He tried with all his might to jump over the enclosure, but was unsuccessful. He kept on trying until he was tired. Then, he tried to break down the fence, but that too proved futile. He became very thirsty and hungry. He decided to rest a while.\n\nHe became desperate and thought that he might never get out of there alive.\n\nHe starts hallucinating about food and good spring water. Once more, he decided to give it a try with all his might. He kept on hammering the enclosure, until there was a little gap. He pushed and shoved through the gap and finally broke through. However, he was injured very badly in the process, and got deep gashes and cuts on either side of the body. As a result, to this day, he carries those stripes.\n\n"

      "body": "The Tale of Mr.Tod:\n\nNobody could call Mr. Tod “nice.” The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.\n\nOne day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.\n\nIn winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.\n\nHe had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.\n\nThe houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved out; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved in; (without asking leave).\n\nTommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.\n\nHis clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was generally Mr. Tod’s.\n\nNow Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.\n\nOld Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.\n\nHe lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.\n\nThe little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth—old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.\n\nHe sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants’ eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter—”I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living on pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!” said Tommy Brock.\n\nIt was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.\n\nSo old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed-cake and “a glass of my daughter Flopsy’s cowslip wine.” Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.\n\nThen old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.\n\nAnd Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke . .\n\nWhen Flopsy and Benjamin came back—old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!\n\nMr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.\n\nBenjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.\n\nThere was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger’s heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.\n\nThe path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths—but the smell that made Benjamin stop, was not the smell of flowers!\n\n Mr. Tod’s stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home. There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it—there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.\n\nBenjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted.\n\nHe never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.\n\nBenjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.—”Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!” shouted Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThe blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears\n\n“Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?”\n\n“No, no, no! He’s bagged my family—Tommy Brock—in a sack—have you seen him?”\n\n“Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?”\n\n“Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way? Please tell me quick!”\n\n“Yes, yes; not ten minutes since … he said they were caterpillars; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.”\n\n“Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?”\n\n“He had a sack with something ‘live in it; I watched him set a mole trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning.”\n\nBenjamin did so.\n\n“My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;” said Peter reflectively, “but there are two hopeful circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had refreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.” “Which way?” “Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr. Tod’s other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail’s; he said he would be passing.” (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill).\n\nPeter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.\n\n“He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a nasty person!” said Peter.\n\nThe sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.\n\nCottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him.\n\nHe had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.—”Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!” said Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThey climbed up and up;—”He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole.” “They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!”\n\nWhen they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag—Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.\n\nThis house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.\n\nThe setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.\n\nBenjamin sighed with relief.\n\nBut there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.\n\nAt the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair—in short, preparations for one person’s supper.\n\nNo person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.\n\nThen they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It was damp and smelly, and overgrown with thorns and briars.\n\nThe rabbits shivered in their shoes.\n\n“Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!” sighed Benjamin.\n\nThey crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open; the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the window-sill.\n\nThe room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise—a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod’s bed, curled up under the blanket.—”He has gone to bed in his boots,” whispered Peter.\n\nBenjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.\n\nTommy Brock’s snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod’s bed. Nothing could be seen of the young family.\n\nThe sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many unpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens’ legs and other horrors. It was a shocking place, and very dark.\n\nThey went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light.\n\nThey sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.\n\nIn half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window. But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!\n\nThe moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor.\n\nThe light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace—a little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.\n\nAnd presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window—the little door opposite shook in answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!\n\nBenjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod’s bed.\n\nBut there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could not open the window; and although the young family was alive—the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl.\n\nAfter much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.\n\nThey dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor. Benjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter’s claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that it was morning—sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.\n\nBenjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.\n\nAgain from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay—followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!\n\nThen those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod’s kitchen floor.\n\nMr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.\n\nAs usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody’s leavings but his own.\n\nHe made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.\n\n Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head—Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.\n\nHe approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.\n\nThe sight that met Mr. Tod’s eyes in Mr. Tod’s kitchen made Mr. Tod furious. There was Mr. Tod’s chair, and Mr. Tod’s pie dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table-cloth that he had left folded up in the dresser—all set out for supper (or breakfast)—without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.\n\nThere was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.\n\nBut what absorbed Mr. Tod’s attention was a noise—a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.\n\nHe peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.\n\nFor the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured further in—right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside—he did not like the look of Tommy Brock’s teeth.\n\nHe was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear. He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.\n\nMr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought better of it, and took them away.\n\nWhen he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.\n\nMr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.\n\nMr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye—shut it hastily. The snores continued.\n\nMr. Tod’s proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy, (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.\n\nTommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute; then he left the room again.\n\nTommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.\n\nMr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any idea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly.\n\nHis foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock’s work.\n\nHe took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree.\n\nTommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was puzzled.\n\nMr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.\n\nTommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.\n\nMr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook—hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.\n\nMr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock’s teeth.\n\nHe reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.\n\n(Mr. Tod’s curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!\n\nIt seemed as though nothing would waken him—not even the flapping rope across the bed.\n\nMr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.\n\n But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)—he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.\n\nThe snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock’s hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.\n\nMr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug. The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.\n\nSurely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.\n\nAs he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,—except one eye.\n\nAt last Mr. Tod’s preparations were complete. The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the window sill to the tree outside.\n\n“It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,” said Mr. Tod.\n\nMr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.\n\nHe ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock—\n\n“I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,” said Mr. Tod.\n\nThe moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod’s dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also—grinning immensely.\n\nHe went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.\n\nWhen Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.\n\nInside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.\n\nBut no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.\n\nIn the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened something—much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was not snoring any longer.\n\nThere was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop drip of water trickling from the mattress.\n\nMr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.\n\nThen he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.\n\nYes—there was no doubt about it—it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!\n\n“I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,” said Mr. Tod.\n\n“I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot-water bottle.”\n\n“I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.”\n\nHe hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen—”First I will arrange the hole—then I will drag out that person in the blanket….”\n\nHe opened the door….\n\nTommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod’s kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod’s tea-pot into Mr. Tod’s tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.\n\nThen Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.\n\nThey crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.\n\nInside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.\n\nEverything was upset except the kitchen table.\n\nAnd everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.\n\nThe chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod’s sandy whiskers.\n\nThe vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam.\n\nAnd the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.\n\nWhen the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.\n\nThen the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.\n\nAs soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes—\n\n“Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them! while I watch at the door.”\n\nBut Benjamin was frightened—\n\n“Oh; oh! they are coming back!”\n\n“No they are not.”\n\n“Yes they are!”\n\n“What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry.”\n\nStill Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him—\n\n“Be quick, it’s all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won’t miss them.”\n\nDecidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod’s kitchen!\n\nAt home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.\n\nAfter quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The day passed heavily.\n\nOld Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.\n\nIn Mr. Tod’s kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.\n\n“I’ve got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?”\n\nPeter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.\n\nFive minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole.\n\nGreat was old Mr. Bouncer’s relief and Flopsy’s joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They soon recovered.\n\nA long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.\n\nOld Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and Benjamin told their story—but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod."

      "body": "The Juniper Tree:\n\nLong ago, at least two thousand years, there was a rich man who had a beautiful and pious wife, and they loved each other dearly. However, they had no children, though they wished very much to have some, and the woman prayed for them day and night, but they didn't get any, and they didn't get any.\n\nIn front of their house there was a courtyard where there stood a juniper tree. One day in winter the woman was standing beneath it, peeling herself an apple, and while she was thus peeling the apple, she cut her finger, and the blood fell into the snow.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the woman. She sighed heavily, looked at the blood before her, and was most unhappy. \"If only I had a child as red as blood and as white as snow.\" And as she said that, she became quite contented, and felt sure that it was going to happen.\n\nThen she went into the house, and a month went by, and the snow was gone. And two months, and everything was green. And three months, and all the flowers came out of the earth. And four months, and all the trees in the woods grew thicker, and the green branches were all entwined in one another, and the birds sang until the woods resounded and the blossoms fell from the trees. Then the fifth month passed, and she stood beneath the juniper tree, which smelled so sweet that her heart jumped for joy, and she fell on her knees and was beside herself. And when the sixth month was over, the fruit was thick and large, and then she was quite still. And after the seventh month she picked the juniper berries and ate them greedily. Then she grew sick and sorrowful. Then the eighth month passed, and she called her husband to her, and cried, and said, \"If I die, then bury me beneath the juniper tree.\" Then she was quite comforted and happy until the next month was over, and then she had a child as white as snow and as red as blood, and when she saw it, she was so happy that she died.\n\nHer husband buried her beneath the juniper tree, and he began to cry bitterly. After some time he was more at ease, and although he still cried, he could bear it. And some time later he took another wife.\n\nHe had a daughter by the second wife, but the first wife's child was a little son, and he was as red as blood and as white as snow. When the woman looked at her daughter, she loved her very much, but then she looked at the little boy, and it pierced her heart, for she thought that he would always stand in her way, and she was always thinking how she could get the entire inheritance for her daughter. And the Evil One filled her mind with this until she grew very angry with the little boy, and she pushed him from one corner to the other and slapped him here and cuffed him there, until the poor child was always afraid, for when he came home from school there was nowhere he could find any peace.\n\nOne day the woman had gone upstairs to her room, when her little daughter came up too, and said, \"Mother, give me an apple.\"\n\n\"Yes, my child,\" said the woman, and gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest. The chest had a large heavy lid with a large sharp iron lock.\n\n\"Mother,\" said the little daughter, \"is brother not to have one too?\"\n\nThis made the woman angry, but she said, \"Yes, when he comes home from school.\"\n\nWhen from the window she saw him coming, it was as though the Evil One came over her, and she grabbed the apple and took it away from her daughter, saying, \"You shall not have one before your brother.\"\n\nShe threw the apple into the chest, and shut it. Then the little boy came in the door, and the Evil One made her say to him kindly, \"My son, do you want an apple?\" And she looked at him fiercely.\n\n\"Mother,\" said the little boy, \"how angry you look. Yes, give me an apple.\"\n\nThen it seemed to her as if she had to persuade him. \"Come with me,\" she said, opening the lid of the chest. \"Take out an apple for yourself.\" And while the little boy was leaning over, the Evil One prompted her, and crash! she slammed down the lid, and his head flew off, falling among the red apples.\n\nThen fear overcame her, and she thought, \"Maybe I can get out of this.\" So she went upstairs to her room to her chest of drawers, and took a white scarf out of the top drawer, and set the head on the neck again, tying the scarf around it so that nothing could be seen. Then she set him on a chair in front of the door and put the apple in his hand.\n\nAfter this Marlene came into the kitchen to her mother, who was standing by the fire with a pot of hot water before her which she was stirring around and around.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Marlene, \"brother is sitting at the door, and he looks totally white and has an apple in his hand. I asked him to give me the apple, but he did not answer me, and I was very frightened.\"\n\n\"Go back to him,\" said her mother, \"and if he will not answer you, then box his ears.\"\n\nSo Marlene went to him and said, \"Brother, give me the apple.\" But he was silent, so she gave him one on the ear, and his head fell off. Marlene was terrified, and began crying and screaming, and ran to her mother, and said, \"Oh, mother, I have knocked my brother's head off,\" and she cried and cried and could not be comforted.\n\n\"Marlene,\" said the mother, \"what have you done? Be quiet and don't let anyone know about it. It cannot be helped now. We will cook him into stew.\"\n\nThen the mother took the little boy and chopped him in pieces, put him into the pot, and cooked him into stew. But Marlene stood by crying and crying, and all her tears fell into the pot, and they did not need any salt.\n\nThen the father came home, and sat down at the table and said, \"Where is my son?\" And the mother served up a large, large dish of stew, and Marlene cried and could not stop.\n\nThen the father said again, \"Where is my son?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the mother, \"he has gone across the country to his mother's great uncle. He will stay there awhile.\"\n\n\"What is he doing there? He did not even say good-bye to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, he wanted to go, and asked me if he could stay six weeks. He will be well taken care of there.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the man, \"I am unhappy. It isn't right. He should have said good-bye to me.\" With that he began to eat, saying, \"Marlene, why are you crying? Your brother will certainly come back.\"\n\nThen he said, \"Wife, this food is delicious. Give me some more.\" And the more he ate the more he wanted, and he said, \"Give me some more. You two shall have none of it. It seems to me as if it were all mine.\" And he ate and ate, throwing all the bones under the table, until he had finished it all.\n\nMarlene went to her chest of drawers, took her best silk scarf from the bottom drawer, and gathered all the bones from beneath the table and tied them up in her silk scarf, then carried them outside the door, crying tears of blood.\n\nShe laid them down beneath the juniper tree on the green grass, and after she had put them there, she suddenly felt better and did not cry anymore.\n\nThen the juniper tree began to move. The branches moved apart, then moved together again, just as if someone were rejoicing and clapping his hands. At the same time a mist seemed to rise from the tree, and in the center of this mist it burned like a fire, and a beautiful bird flew out of the fire singing magnificently, and it flew high into the air, and when it was gone, the juniper tree was just as it had been before, and the cloth with the bones was no longer there. Marlene, however, was as happy and contented as if her brother were still alive. And she went merrily into the house, sat down at the table, and ate.\n\nThen the bird flew away and lit on a goldsmith's house, and began to sing:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nMy father, he ate me,\nMy sister Marlene,\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nThe goldsmith was sitting in his workshop making a golden chain, when he heard the bird sitting on his roof and singing. The song seemed very beautiful to him. He stood up, but as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers. However, he went right up the middle of the street with only one slipper and one sock on. He had his leather apron on, and in one hand he had a golden chain and in the other his tongs. The sun was shining brightly on the street.\n\nHe walked onward, then stood still and said to the bird, \"Bird,\" he said, \"how beautifully you can sing. Sing that piece again for me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the bird, \"I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the golden chain, and then I will sing it again for you.\"\n\nThe goldsmith said, \"Here is the golden chain for you. Now sing that song again for me.\" Then the bird came and took the golden chain in his right claw, and went and sat in front of the goldsmith, and sang:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nMy father, he ate me,\nMy sister Marlene,\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nThen the bird flew away to a shoemaker, and lit on his roof and sang:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nMy father, he ate me,\nMy sister Marlene,\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nHearing this, the shoemaker ran out of doors in his shirtsleeves, and looked up at his roof, and had to hold his hand in front of his eyes to keep the sun from blinding him. \"Bird,\" said he, \"how beautifully you can sing.\"\n\nThen he called in at his door, \"Wife, come outside. There is a bird here. Look at this bird. He certainly can sing.\" Then he called his daughter and her children, and the journeyman, and the apprentice, and the maid, and they all came out into the street and looked at the bird and saw how beautiful he was, and what fine red and green feathers he had, and how his neck was like pure gold, and how his eyes shone like stars in his head.\n\n\"Bird,\" said the shoemaker, \"now sing that song again for me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the bird, \"I do not sing twice for nothing. You must give me something.\"\n\n\"Wife,\" said the man, \"go into the shop. There is a pair of red shoes on the top shelf. Bring them down.\" Then the wife went and brought the shoes.\n\n\"There, bird,\" said the man, \"now sing that piece again for me.\" Then the bird came and took the shoes in his left claw, and flew back to the roof, and sang:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nMy father, he ate me,\nMy sister Marlene,\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nWhen he had finished his song he flew away. In his right claw he had the chain and in his left one the shoes. He flew far away to a mill, and the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. In the mill sat twenty miller's apprentices cutting a stone, and chiseling chip-chop, chip-chop, chip-chop. And the mill went clickety-clack, clickety-clack, clickety-clack.\n\nThen the bird went and sat on a linden tree which stood in front of the mill, and sang:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nThen one of them stopped working.\n\nMy father, he ate me,\nThen two more stopped working and listened,\n\nMy sister Marlene,\nThen four more stopped,\n\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nNow only eight only were chiseling,\n\nLaid them beneath\nNow only five,\n\nthe juniper tree,\nNow only one,\n\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nThen the last one stopped also, and heard the last words. \"Bird,\" said he, \"how beautifully you sing. Let me hear that too. Sing it once more for me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the bird, \"I do not sing twice for nothing. Give me the millstone, and then I will sing it again.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"if it belonged only to me, you should have it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the others, \"if he sings again he can have it.\"\n\nThen the bird came down, and the twenty millers took a beam and lifted the stone up. Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho! Yo-heave-ho!\n\nThe bird stuck his neck through the hole and put the stone on as if it were a collar, then flew to the tree again, and sang:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nMy father, he ate me,\nMy sister Marlene,\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nWhen he was finished singing, he spread his wings, and in his right claw he had the chain, and in his left one the shoes, and around his neck the millstone. He flew far away to his father's house.\n\nIn the room the father, the mother, and Marlene were sitting at the table.\n\nThe father said, \"I feel so contented. I am so happy.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said the mother, \"I feel uneasy, just as if a bad storm were coming.\"\n\nBut Marlene just sat and cried and cried.\n\nThen the bird flew up, and as it seated itself on the roof, the father said, \"Oh, I feel so truly happy, and the sun is shining so beautifully outside. I feel as if I were about to see some old acquaintance again.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said the woman, \"I am so afraid that my teeth are chattering, and I feel like I have fire in my veins.\" And she tore open her bodice even more. Marlene sat in a corner crying. She held a handkerchief before her eyes and cried until it was wet clear through.\n\nThen the bird seated itself on the juniper tree, and sang:\n\nMy mother, she killed me,\nThe mother stopped her ears and shut her eyes, not wanting to see or hear, but there was a roaring in her ears like the fiercest storm, and her eyes burned and flashed like lightning.\n\nMy father, he ate me,\n\"Oh, mother,\" said the man, \"that is a beautiful bird. He is singing so splendidly, and the sun is shining so warmly, and it smells like pure cinnamon.\"\n\nMy sister Marlene,\nThen Marlene laid her head on her knees and cried and cried, but the man said, \"I am going out. I must see the bird up close.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't go,\" said the woman, \"I feel as if the whole house were shaking and on fire.\"\n\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\n\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nWith this the bird dropped the golden chain, and it fell right around the man's neck, so exactly around it that it fit beautifully. Then the man went in and said, \"Just look what a beautiful bird that is, and what a beautiful golden chain he has given me, and how nice it looks.\"\n\nBut the woman was terrified. She fell down on the floor in the room, and her cap fell off her head. Then the bird sang once more:\n\nMy mother killed me.\n\"I wish I were a thousand fathoms beneath the earth, so I would not have to hear that!\"\n\nMy father, he ate me,\nThen the woman fell down as if she were dead.\n\nMy sister Marlene,\n\"Oh,\" said Marlene, \"I too will go out and see if the bird will give me something.\" Then she went out.\n\nGathered all my bones,\nTied them in a silken scarf,\nHe threw the shoes down to her.\n\nLaid them beneath the juniper tree,\nTweet, tweet, what a beautiful bird am I.\nThen she was contented and happy. She put on the new red shoes and danced and leaped into the house. \"Oh,\" she said, \"I was so sad when I went out and now I am so contented. That is a splendid bird, he has given me a pair of red shoes.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the woman, jumping to her feet and with her hair standing up like flames of fire, \"I feel as if the world were coming to an end. I too, will go out and see if it makes me feel better.\"\n\nAnd as she went out the door, crash! the bird threw the millstone on her head, and it crushed her to death.\n\nThe father and Marlene heard it and went out. Smoke, flames, and fire were rising from the place, and when that was over, the little brother was standing there, and he took his father and Marlene by the hand, and all three were very happy, and they went into the house, sat down at the table, and ate."

      "body": "The Miser In The Bush:\n\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming over hill and valley.\n\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man. ‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes—one for every penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way.\n\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’ said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’ ‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse, and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain.\n\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried.\n\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\n\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.\n\nThen the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together—judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties, till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him the hundred florins.\n\nThen he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows."

      "body": "Seeking The Violets:\n\nALL the wood had been blue with violets, but now they were nearly gone. The birds sang louder and louder to keep them and to call them back, but soon there was not a violet left in all the wood from end to end. The snowdrops died, and the primrose faded, the cowslips and blue-bells vanished, the thorn grew white with blossom, the wild honeysuckle filled the wood with its fragrance, and soon the fruit began to ripen.\n\nThe blackbirds and the swallows and the chaffinches, and all the birds they knew, gathered round the garden trees and bushes and forgot the woods until suddenly one day they espied a little child. She was sitting on a chair under a tree; she had a little table before her and a pink ribbon around her hat; she was eating fruit with a large silver spoon.\n\nThe birds were afraid and held aloof until a sparrow chirped and the child looked up, and when they saw how blue her eyes were, they sang out bravely and fluttered around her, thinking that she had brought them news from the violets. But she never looked up again, though the birds crowded on to the branch above her, and perched upon the table, and rubbed their little beaks against her plate. She just held on her hat with one hand, and with the other went on taking up the fruit with a silver spoon.\n\n“Ah, dear child, “ a swallow twittered, “perhaps you do not know what is written in your eyes; so many of us carry secrets that we ourselves know last of all “"

      "body": "The Little Peasant:\n\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her: ‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head hanging down as if it were eating.\n\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there, but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself, just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together, but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\n\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\n\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\n\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with the three hundred talers.\n\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all these skins?’\n\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the major. The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about? What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’ The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in, and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\n\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished, and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down, until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he, ‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man."

      "body": "The Twelve Dancing Princesses:\n\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept intwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been.\n\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\n\nA king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes.The same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner.\n\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman, who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves you pretend to be fast asleep.’\n\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said he was willing to undertake the task.\n\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes,and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain? And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’\n\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully. The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loudnoise from the tree. Then the youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right—did not you hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’\n\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy. So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them, who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\n\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’\n\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off. The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night.\n\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been.\n\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle underground.’ And then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’—And they were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s heir."

      "body": "The Golden Goose:\n\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was considered very silly, and everybody used to mock him and make fun of him. The eldest son wanted to go and cut wood in the forest, and before he left home his mother prepared beautiful pancakes and a bottle of wine for him to take with him, so that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\n\nAs he entered the forest he met a gray old man, who bade him “Good-morning,” and said: “Give me a little piece of cake out of your basket and a drop of wine out of your bottle, for I am very hungry and thirsty.”\n\nBut the clever son replied: “What, give you my cake and my wine! Why, if I did, I should have none for myself. Not I, indeed, so take yourself off!” and he left the man standing and went on.\n\nThe young man began cutting down a tree, but it was not long before he made a false stroke: the axe slipped and cut his arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up. Now, this false stroke was caused by the little gray old man.\n\nNext day the second son went into the forest to cut wood, and his mother gave him a cake and a bottle of wine. As he entered the wood the same little old man met him, and begged for a piece of cake and a drop of wine. But the second son answered rudely: “What I might give to you I shall want myself, so be off.”\n\nThen he left the little old man standing in the road, and walked on. His punishment soon came; he had scarcely given two strokes on a tree with his axe, when he hit his leg such a terrible blow that he was obliged to limp home in great pain.\n\nThen the stupid son said to his father, “Let me go for once and cut wood in the forest.”\n\nBut his father said: “No, your brothers have been hurt already, and it would be worse for you, who don’t understand wood-cutting.”\n\nThe boy, however, begged so hard to be allowed to go that his father said: “There, get along with you; you will buy your experience very dearly, I expect.”\n\nHis mother, however, gave him a cake which had been made with water and baked in the ashes, and a bottle of sour beer.\n\nWhen he reached the wood the very same little old man met him, and after greeting him kindly, said: “Give me a little of your cake and a drop from your bottle, for I am very hungry and thirsty.”\n\n“Oh,” replied the simple youth, “I have only a cake, which has been baked in the ashes, and some sour beer; but you are welcome to a share of it. Let us sit down, and eat and drink together.”\n\nSo they seated themselves, and, lo and behold, when the youth opened his basket, the cake had been turned into a beautiful cake, and the sour beer into wine. After they had eaten and drank enough, the little old man said: “Because you have been kind-hearted, and shared your dinner with me, I will make you in future lucky in all you undertake. There stands an old tree; cut it down, and you will find something good at the root.”\n\nThen the old man said “Farewell,” and left him.\n\nThe youth set to work, and very soon succeeded in felling the tree, when he found sitting at the roots a goose, whose feathers were of pure gold. He took it up, and, instead of going home, carried it with him to an inn at a little distance, where he intended to pass the night.\nThe landlord had three daughters, who looked at the goose with envious eyes. They had never seen such a wonderful bird, and longed to have at least one of its feathers. “Ah,” thought the eldest, “I shall soon have an opportunity to pluck one of them;” and so it happened, for not long after the young man left the room. She instantly went up to the bird and took hold of its wing, but as she did so, the finger and thumb remained and stuck fast. In a short time after the second sister came in with the full expectation of gaining a golden feather, but as she touched her sister to move her from the bird, her hand stuck fast to her sister’s dress, and neither of them could free herself. At last, in came the third sister with the same intention. “Keep away, keep away!” screamed the other two; “in heaven’s name keep away!”\n\nBut she could not imagine why she should keep away. If they were near the golden bird, why should not she be there? So she made a spring forward and touched her second sister, and immediately she also was made a prisoner, and in this position they were obliged to remain by the goose all night.\n\nIn the morning the young man came in, took the goose on his arm, and went away without troubling himself about the three girls, who were following close behind him. And as he walked quickly, they were obliged to run one behind the other, left or right of him, just as he was inclined to go.\n\nIn the middle of a field they were met by the parson of the parish, who looked with wonder at the procession as it came near him. “Shame on you!” he cried out. “What are you about, you bold-faced hussies, running after a young man in that way through the fields? Go home, all of you.”\n\nHe placed his hand on the youngest to pull her back, but the moment he touched her he also became fixed, and was obliged to follow and run like the rest. In a few minutes the clerk met them, and when he saw the parson running after the girls, he wondered greatly, and cried out, “Halloa, master parson, where are you running in such haste? Have you forgotten that there is a christening to-day?” And as the procession did not stop, he ran after it, and seized the parson’s gown.\n\nIn a moment he found that his hand was fixed, and he also had to run like the rest. And now there were five trotting along, one behind the other. Presently two peasants came by with their sickles from the field. The parson called out to them, and begged them to come and release him and the clerk. Hardly had they touched the clerk when they also stuck fast as the others, and the simpleton with his golden goose travelled with the seven.\n\nAfter awhile they came to a city in which reigned a king who had a daughter of such a melancholy disposition that no one could make her laugh; therefore he issued a decree that whoever would make the princess laugh should have her in marriage.\n\nNow, when the simple youth heard this, he ran before her, and the whole seven trotted after him. The sight was so ridiculous that the moment the princess saw it she burst into a violent fit of laughter and they thought she would never leave off.\n\nAfter this, the youth went to the king, and demanded his daughter in marriage, according to the king’s decree; but his majesty did not quite like to have the young man for a son-in-law, so he said that, before he could consent to the marriage, the youth must bring him a man who could drink all the wine in the king’s cellar.\n\nThe simpleton went into the forest, for he thought, “If anyone can help me, it is the little gray man.” When he arrived at the spot where he had cut down the tree, there stood a man with a very miserable face.\n\nThe youth asked him why he looked so sorrowful.\n\n“Oh,” he exclaimed, “I suffer such dreadful thirst that nothing seems able to quench it; and cold water I cannot endure. I have emptied a cask of wine already, but it was just like a drop of water on a hot stone.”\n\n“I can help you,” cried the young man; “come with me, and you shall have your fill, I promise you.”\n\nUpon this he led the man into the king’s cellar, where he opened the casks one after another, and drank and drank till his back ached; and before the day closed he had quite emptied the king’s cellar.\n\nAgain the young man asked for his bride, but the king was annoyed at the thought of giving his daughter to such a common fellow, and to get rid of him he made another condition. He said that no man should have his daughter who could not find someone able to eat up a whole mountain of bread.\n\nAway went the simpleton to the forest as before, and there in the same place sat a man binding himself round tightly with a belt, and making the most horrible faces. As the youth approached, he cried, “I have eaten a whole ovenfull of rolls, but it has not satisfied me a bit; I am as hungry as ever, and my stomach feels so empty that I am obliged to bind it round tightly, or I should die of hunger.”\n\nThe simpleton could hardly contain himself for joy when he heard this. “Get up,” he exclaimed, “and come with me, and I will give you plenty to eat, I’ll warrant.”\n\nSo he led him to the king’s court, where his majesty had ordered all the flour in the kingdom to be made into bread, and piled up in a huge mountain. The hungry man placed himself before the bread, and began to eat, and before evening the whole pile had disappeared.\n\nThen the simpleton went a third time to the king, and asked for his bride, but the king made several excuses, and at last said that if he could bring him a ship that would travel as well by land as by water, then he should, without any further conditions, marry his daughter.\n\nThe youth went at once straight to the forest, and saw the same old gray man to whom he had given his cake. “Ah,” he said, as the youth approached, “it was I who sent the men to eat and drink, and I will also give you a ship that can travel by land or by sea, because when you thought I was poor you were kind-hearted, and gave me food and drink.”\n\nThe youth took the ship, and when the king saw it he was quite surprised; but he could not any longer refuse to give him his daughter in marriage. The wedding was celebrated with great pomp, and after the king’s death the simple wood-cutter inherited the whole kingdom, and lived happily with his wife."

      "body": "How The Camel Got His Hump:\n\nOW this is the next tale, and it tells how the Camel got his big hump.\n\nIn the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work; and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most 'scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said 'Humph!' Just 'Humph!' and no more.\n\nPresently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come out and trot like the rest of us.'\n\n'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.\n\nPresently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.'\n\n'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.\n\nPresently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said, 'Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.'\n\n'Humph!' said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.\n\nAt the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox together, and said, 'Three, O Three, I'm very sorry for you (with the world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can't work, or he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and you must work double-time to make up for it.'\n\nThat made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they held a palaver, and an indaba, and a punchayet, and a pow-wow on the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed most 'scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said 'Humph!' and went away again.\n\nPresently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic), and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.\n\n'Djinn of All Deserts,' said the Horse, 'is it right for any one to be idle, with the world so new-and-all?'\n\n'Certainly not,' said the Djinn.\n\n'Well,' said the Horse, 'there's a thing in the middle of your Howling Desert (and he's a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and he hasn't done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won't trot.'\n\n'Whew!' said the Djinn, whistling, 'that's my Camel, for all the gold in Arabia! What does he say about it?'\n\n'He says \"Humph!\"' said the Dog; 'and he won't fetch and carry.'\n\n'Does he say anything else?'\n\n'Only \"Humph!\"; and he won't plough,' said the Ox.\n\n'Very good,' said the Djinn. 'I'll humph him if you will kindly wait a minute.'\n\nThe Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across the desert, and found the Camel most 'scruciatingly idle, looking at his own reflection in a pool of water.\n\n'My long and bubbling friend,' said the Djinn, 'what's this I hear of your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?'\n\n'Humph!' said the Camel.\n\nThe Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of water.\n\n'You've given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on account of your 'scruciating idleness,' said the Djinn; and he went on thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.\n\n'Humph!' said the Camel.\n\n'I shouldn't say that again if I were you,' said the Djinn; 'you might say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.'\n\nAnd the Camel said 'Humph!' again; but no sooner had he said it than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a great big lolloping humph.\n\n'Do you see that?' said the Djinn. 'That's your very own humph that you've brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is Thursday, and you've done no work since Monday, when the work began. Now you are going to work.'\n\n'How can I,' said the Camel, 'with this humph on my back?'\n\n'That's made a-purpose,' said the Djinn, 'all because you missed those three days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don't you ever say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!'\n\nAnd the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call it 'hump' now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he has never yet learned how to behave.\n\n----\n\nThe Camel's hump is an ugly lump\nWhich well you may see at the Zoo;\nBut uglier yet is the hump we get\nFrom having too little to do.\n\nKiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,\nIf we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,\nWe get the hump\nCameelious hump\n\nThe hump that is black and blue!\nWe climb out of bed with a frouzly head\nAnd a snarly-yarly voice.\nWe shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl\n\nAt our bath and our boots and our toys;\nAnd there ought to be a corner for me\n(And I know there is one for you)\nWhen we get the hump\n\nCameelious hump\nThe hump that is black and blue!\nThe cure for this ill is not to sit still,\nOr frowst with a book by the fire;\n\nBut to take a large hoe and a shovel also,\nAnd dig till you gently perspire;\nAnd then you will find that the sun and the wind,\nAnd the Djinn of the Garden too,\n\nHave lifted the hump\nThe horrible hump\nThe hump that is black and blue!\nI get it as well as you-oo-oo\n\nIf I haven't enough to do-oo-oo\nWe all get hump\nCameelious hump\nKiddies and grown-ups too!"

      "body": "The Pink Parasol:\n\nTHE pink parasol had tender whalebone ribs and a slender stick of cherry-wood. It lived with the willful child in the white-house, just beyond the third milestone. All about the trees were green, and the flowers grew tall; in the pond behind the willows, the ducks swam round and round and dipped their heads beneath the water.\n\nEvery bird and bee, every leaf and flower, loved the child and the pink parasol as they wandered in the garden together, listening to the birds and seeking the shady spots to rest in, or walking up and down the long trim pathway in the sunshine. Yet the child tired of it all, and before the summer was over, was always standing by the gate, watching the straight white road that stretched across the plain.\n\n“If I might but see the city, with the busy streets, and the eager crowds, “ he was always saying to himself.\n\nThen all that lived in the garden knew that the child would not be with them long. At last, the day came when he flung down the pink parasol, and, without even one last look at the garden, ran out at the gate.\n\nThe flowers died, and the swallows journeyed south; the trees stretched higher and higher, to see the child come back across the plain, but he never came.\n\n“Ah, dear child! “ they sighed many a time, “why are you staying? And are your eyes as blue as ever; or have the sad tears dimmed them? And is your hair golden still? And your voice, is it like the singing of the birds? And your heart oh! My dear, my dear, what is in your heart now, that once was so full of summer and the sun? “\n\nThe pink parasol lay on the pathway, where the child left it, spoilt by the rain, and splashed by the gravel, faded and forgotten. At last, a gipsy lad, with dark eyes, a freckled face, and little gold rings in his ears, came by; he picked up the pink parasol, hid it under his coat, and carried it to the gipsy tent. There it stayed till one day the cherry-wood stick was broken into three pieces, and the pink parasol was put on the fire to make the water boil for the gipsy‘s tea."

      "body": "The Old House:\n\nSomewhere in the street stood an old old house; it was almost three hundred years old, as you could tell from the date cut into the great beam. Tulips and hopbines and also whole verses of poetry were carved into the wood as people used to do in those days, and over every window a mocking face was cut into the beam. The second story hung way out over the ground floor, and right under the eaves was a leaden spout with a dragon's head. Rain water was supposed to run out of the dragon's mouth, but it came from his belly instead, for there was a hole in it.\n\nAll of the other houses in the street were so neat and modern, with large windowpanes and smooth walls, that you could easily tell they would have nothing to do with the old house. They evidently thought, \"How long do you suppose that decrepit old thing is going to stand there, making an eyesore of our street? And that bay window stands so far out we can't see from our windows what's happening in that direction. Those front steps are as broad as those of a palace, and as high as those which go up to a church tower! The iron railings-they look like the door to an old family vault! And those dreadful brass rails on them! It makes one feel ashamed!\"\n\nAcross the street were other neat and modern houses, and they thought the same way. But at the window in the house directly opposite sat a little boy with bright shining eyes and fresh rosy cheeks. And he liked the old house best of all those on the street, whether by sunshine or by moonlight.\n\nWhen he looked across at the wall where the mortar had fallen out, he could imagine the strangest pictures. He could see the street as it was in the old days; he could see soldiers with halberds, and the houses with their steps and projecting windows and pointed gables, and rainspouts in the shapes of dragons and serpents. Yes, to him that was indeed a house worth looking at!\n\nAn old man lived over there-an old man who wore old-fashioned plush breeches and a coat with big brass buttons, and a wig that you could plainly tell was a real one. Every morning an old male servant came, to put the rooms in order and do the marketing, but aside from that, the old man in the plush breeches lived all alone in his old house. Sometimes he came to the window and looked out, and the little boy waved to him, and the old man waved back, and so they became acquaintances and then friends. Of course, they had never spoken to each other, but that really made no difference.\n\nOne day the little boy heard his parents say, \"The old man over there is very well to do, but he's terribly lonely!\"\n\nNext Sunday the little boy wrapped a small object in a piece of paper, went downstairs to his doorway, and, when the old servant who did the marketing came by, said to him, \"Look, sir, will you please give this to the old gentleman across the way? I have two tin soldiers; this is one of them, and I want him to have it 'cause I know he's terribly lonely.\"\n\nThe old servant looked very pleased as he nodded, and took the tin soldier across to the house. And later he brought back a message inviting the little boy to come over and pay a visit. Happily the little boy asked his parents' permission, then went across to the old house.\n\nThe brass knobs on the railings shone brighter than ever - one would think they had been especially polished in honor of his visit. And the little trumpeters carved in tulips on the doorway seemed to puff out their cheeks and blow with all their might, \"Tratteratra! The boy approaches! Tratteratra!\" Then the door opened.\n\nThe whole hallway was hung with old portraits of knights in armor and ladies in silken gowns, and the armor seemed to rattle and the silken gowns rustle! Then there was a flight of stairs that went a long way up and a little way down, and then the little boy came out on a balcony. It was very dilapidated, with grass and leaves growing out of holes and long crevices, for the whole balcony outside, the yard, and the walls were so overgrown that it looked like a garden. But still it was just a balcony. There were old flowerpots with faces and donkey's ears, and flowers growing out of them just as they pleased. One of the pots was almost brimming over with carnations-that is, with the green part; shoot grew by shoot, and each seemed to say quite distinctly, \"The air has blessed me, and the sun has kissed me and promised me a little flower on Sunday! A little flower on Sunday!\"\n\nNow the little boy entered a room where the walls were covered with pigskin and printed with golden flowers.\n\nGilding fades fast;\nBut pigskin will last,\nsaid the walls.\n\nThere were heavily carved easy chairs there, with high backs and arms on both sides. \"Sit down! Sit down!\" they cried. \"Oh, how I creak! I know I'll get the gout, like the old cupboard! Oh!\"\n\nAnd at last the little boy came into the room where the bay window was, and there sat the old man.\n\n\"I thank you for the tin soldier, my young friend,\" he said. \"And I thank you again because you came over to see me.\"\n\n\"Thanks! Thanks!\" or perhaps \"Creak! Creak!\" sounded from all the furniture. And there was so much of it in the room that the pieces seemed to crowd in each other's way, trying to get a look at the little boy.\n\nIn the middle of the wall hung a painting of a beautiful lady, young and happy, but dressed as in olden times, with clothes that stood out stiffly, and with powdered hair. She neither said, \"Thanks!\" nor \"Creak!\" but just looked with mild eyes at the little boy. He promptly asked, \"Where did she come from?\"\n\n\"From the secondhand dealer down the street,\" said the old man, \"where there are so many pictures. No one knows or cares anything about them, for all the people are buried. That lady has been dead and gone these fifty years, but I knew her in the old days.\"\n\nIn a glass frame beneath the portrait there hung a bouquet of withered flowers; they, too, must have been fifty years old-at least they looked it.\n\nThe pendulum of the great clock slowly swung to and fro, and the hands slowly turned, and everything in the room slowly became still older, but they didn't notice it.\n\n\"My mother and daddy say,\" said the little boy, \"that you're terribly lonely.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he answered, \"the old thoughts, with what they may bring with them, come to see me, and now you come, too! I'm really very happy.\"\n\nThen he took a picture book down from the shelf. There were long processions and strange coaches such as one never sees nowadays, soldiers who looked like the knave of clubs, and tradesmen with waving banners. The tailors had a banner that showed a pair of shears held by two lions; and the shoemakers had on theirs not a boot, but an eagle with two heads, for shoemakers must have everything in pairs. What a wonderful picture book that was!\n\nAnd the old man went into the next room to fetch jam, apples, and nuts. Yes, the old house was a wonderful place. \"I can't bear this any longer,\" cried the tin soldier, who was sitting on a chest of drawers. \"It's so lonely and sad here! Anyone who has been in a family circle as I have can't get used to this sort of life. I can't bear it any longer! The days are so long, and the evenings are still longer! Things here aren't the way they were over at your house, where your father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and you and the other nice children made such delightful, happy noises. How lonely this old man is! Do you think he ever gets a kiss? Do you think he ever gets a kindly look or a Christmas tree? He'll get nothing but a funeral-I simply can't stand it any longer!\"\n\n\"You mustn't let it make you so sad,\" said the little boy. \"I think it's fun here, and then all the old memories, with what they may bring with them, come to visit here.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the tin soldier, \"but I can't see them, because I don't know them. I tell you I can't stand it!\"\n\n\"But you must!\" replied the little boy firmly.\n\nThen the old man came back with his face all smiling, and with the most delicious jam and apples and nuts! So the little boy forgot about the tin soldier.\n\nHe went home, happy and pleased, and days and weeks passed, while nods and waves were exchanged to the old house and from the old house. Then he went over to call again.\n\nAgain the carved trumpeters seemed to blow, \"Tratteratra! The little boy approaches! Tratteratra!\" And the swords and armor on the knight paintings rattled, and the silken gowns rustled; the pigskin spoke, and the old chairs had rheumatism in their backs-\"Ouch!\" It was just like the first time, for in that house one day or hour was just like another.\n\n\"I can't bear it!\" wailed the tin soldier. \"I've been shedding tin tears - it's too sad here! I'd rather go to the wars, and lose arms and legs; at least that would be a change! I just can't stand it! Now I know what it's like to have a visit from one's old memories and what they may bring with them. One of mine came to see me, and let me tell you that isn't a very pleasant experience! I nearly jumped down from this chest!\n\n\"Because I saw you all over there so clearly, as if you really were right here! It was again that Sunday morning which you surely remember; all you children stood before the table and sang your hymns, just as you do every Sunday. You looked so devout, with your hands folded together; and your father and mother were just as pious. Then the door was opened, and little Sister Mary was put in the room. She really shouldn't have been there because she's less than two years old, and always tries to dance when she hears any kind of music or singing. She began to dance then, but she couldn't keep time-the music was too slow. First she stood on one leg and bent her head forward, and then she stood on the other leg and bent her head again-but it wouldn't do. You all stood together, and looked very serious, although it was difficult to keep from laughing, but I did laugh to myself so hard I fell off the table and got a bump that I still have! It was very wrong of me to laugh. But it all comes back to me now in thought, and everything that I've seen all my life; these are the old memories and what they may bring with them!\n\n\"Tell me, do you still sing on Sundays? Tell me about little Mary! And how is my comrade, the other tin soldier, doing? I imagine he's happy enough! Oh, I can't stand it any more!\"\n\n\"You were given away as a present,\" said the little boy firmly. \"And you must stay here! Can't you understand that?\"\n\nNow the old man brought in a drawer in which there were many treasures-balm boxes and coin boxes and large, gilded, old playing cards, such as one never sees any more. Several drawers were opened, and then the piano was opened; landscapes were painted on the inside of its lid, and it was so squeaky when the old man played it! Then he hummed a little song.\n\n\"She used to sing that,\" he said softly as he nodded up at the portrait he had bought from the secondhand dealer. And the old man's eyes shone brightly.\n\n\"I'm going to the wars! I tell you I'm going to the wars!\" the tin soldier shouted as loudly as he could, then he threw himself off the chest right down to the floor.\n\nWhat had become of him? The old man searched, and the little boy searched, but he was gone; they couldn't find him.\n\n\"I'll find him,\" said the old man, but he never did; the flooring was open and full of holes, and the tin soldier had fallen into one of the many cracks in the floor and lay there as if in an open grave.\n\nAnd that day passed, and the little boy went home. A week passed, and several more weeks passed.\n\nThe windows of his home were frosted over, and the little boy had to breathe hard on one to make a peephole over to the old house. Then he saw that the snow had drifted into all the carving and inscriptions and up over the steps, just as if there were no one there. And there wasn't, really. For the old man was dead!\n\nThat evening a hearse drove up before the door, and the old man's coffin was borne into it; he was going out into the country now, to lie in his grave. And so he was driven away, but there was no one to follow him, for all the old man's friends were dead. There was only the little boy who blew a kiss to the coffin as it was driven away.\n\nA few days later the old house was sold at auction, and from his window the little boy watched them carry away the old knights and their ladies, and the long-eared flowerpots, the old chairs, and the old cupboards; some pieces landed here and others landed there; the portrait that had come from the secondhand dealer went back to the secondhand dealer again, and there it hung, for no one knew the lady any more, and no one cared about the old picture.\n\nIn the spring the house was torn down, for everybody said it was nothing but a ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with the pigskin hangings, which were slashed and torn; and the green foliage about the balcony hung wild among the falling beams. The site was cleared.\n\n\"Good riddance,\" said the neighboring houses.\n\nThen a fine house was built there, with large windows and smooth white walls; but in front of it, where the old house used to stand, a little garden was laid out, with a wild grapevine running up the wall of the neighboring house. Before the garden was a large railing with an iron gate; it looked quite splendid, and many people stopped to peer in. Scores of sparrows fluttered in the vines and chattered away to each other as fast as they could, but they didn't talk about the old house, for they couldn't remember it. So many years had passed.\n\nYes, many years had passed, and the little boy had grown up now to be a fine man; yes, an able man, and a great joy to his old parents. He had just been married and, with his pretty little wife, came to live in the new house where the garden was.\n\nHe was standing beside her in the garden while she planted a wild flower she was so fond of. She bedded it in the ground with her little hand and pressed the earth around it with her fingers. Ouch, what was that! She had pricked herself. There was something there, pointed straight up in the soft dirt.\n\nYes, it was - just imagine, the little tin soldier! The same one that had been lost in the old man's room. He had tumbled and tossed about among the gravel and the timber and at last had lain for years in the ground.\n\nThe young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green leaf and then with her delicate handkerchief, which had such a delightful scent that it woke the soldier up from his trance.\n\n\"Let me see him,\" said the young man. Then he laughed and shook his head. \"No, it couldn't be he, but he certainly reminds me of a tin soldier I had when I was a little boy.\" Then he told her all about the old house and the old man and the tin soldier that had been sent over to keep him company because he was so terribly lonely. He told it just as it had happened, and the tears came into the eyes of his young wife-tears of pity for the old house and the old man.\n\n\"It might just possibly be the same tin soldier,\" she said gently. \"I'll keep it, and remember everything you've told me. But you must show me the old man's grave.\"\n\n\"But I don't know where it is,\" he replied. \"Nobody knows. All his friends were dead, and there was no one to take care of it. I was then just a little boy.\"\n\n\"How terribly lonely he must have been!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Terribly lonely!\" repeated the tin soldier. \"But it's wonderful not to be forgotten!\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" cried something else close by, but only the tin soldier saw that it was a scrap of the pigskin hanging. It had lost all of its gilding and looked like a piece of wet clay, but it still had its opinion, and gave it:\n\nGilding fades fast;\nBut pigskin will last!\nBut the tin soldier didn't really believe it."

      "body": "The White Snake:\n\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\n\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\n\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no better answer.\n\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened. They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: ’Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: ’Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’ ’Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ’she has spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.\n\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ’We will remember you and repay you for saving us!’\n\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ’Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to him: ’We will remember you–one good turn deserves another!’\n\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ’Out with you, you idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ’we cannot find food for you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’ But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying: ’Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: ’We will remember you–one good turn deserves another!’\n\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ’The king’s daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\n\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea, and added: ’If you come up again without it you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea.\n\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.\n\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ’Tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be wanting.’\n\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\n\nPresently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ’Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever, as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and said: ’We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age."

      "body": "The Sparrow And The Peacock:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a jungle lived a sparrow. Now, every day this sparrow would go and see the king of the birds.\n\nEvery day, without fail this sparrow would be the first to go and the last to come out. Then one day, a small group of birds assembled together on a certain mountain. One of the birds in the assembly suggested that they needed a new king. “There are many of us. And all of us are different, only a king can put an end to our differences,” said one of the birds. So, the sparrow went to provide his counsel. \n\nThe sparrow suggested that peacock shall be the king. Now, the peacock was the king, that sparrow used to visit every day. After the other birds agreed and the peacock was chosen as the king, the sparrow was made the secretary and the wazir by the peacock.\n\nFrom that day onwards, the sparrow started looking after all the important matters. He also brought food and water for the peacock. Then one day, the sparrow did not arrive at the usual time. This had the peacock worried. When the sparrow arrived, the peacock asked what had kept the sparrow.\n\nThe sparrow told the peacock that the sparrow had been scared. “Today, when I was leaving my home, I saw a man near my house. He was setting up nets and spilling grains. So, I stood and watched. Then, after a while, the crane and his wife began to pick up the grains. Then, suddenly they got caught in the net. When they began to cry, the hunter took them away to his home. I am scared. I won’t stay there anymore,” the sparrow said.\n\nBut the peacock told the sparrow that everything was up to fate and the sparrow should not leave his home for such a small matter. The sparrow believed the peacock and continued his work. But ever since that day, the sparrow exercised excessive care whenever he went out.  One day, when the sparrow was headed towards the peacock’s house, he saw two sparrows quarrelling.\n\nThe sparrow could not stand to see them quarrel, so he went to reconcile the other two sparrows. But the moment the sparrow stepped between the other two, a net came flying onto them. And they were trapped.\n\nWhen the hunter picked them up, he told his helper to take special care of the sparrow that had been peacock’s wazir. “He is the fattest I have ever seen!” The poor sparrow knew it was the end for him. “I was such a fool to believe the peacock. The peacock gave me false security and now look what kind of a mess I am in. I should have been more cautious and left my house. I cannot blame the peacock. Afterall, precautions don’t necessarily mean safety. No one can run from fate.”\n\nMORAL OF ARABIAN TALES: YOU CAN TAKE ALL THE PRECAUTIONS, BUT YOU CANNOT RUN FROM YOUR DESTINY."

      "body": "The Queen Bee:\n\nTwo kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant- hill. \n\nThe two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not suffer you to trouble them.’\n\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey. But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’\n\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then he rose and came out to them.\n\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\n\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table, where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun, he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’\n\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day: but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\n\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\n\nAt last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!—so he sat down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants (whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a heap.\n\nThe second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it, he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\n\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\n\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters."

Two sisters had been out mushroom picking, and were on their home with heavy baskets full of mushrooms. They sang songs on the way, and played with each other.\n\nSoon they reached a point where they had to cross a railway track. They did not think twice about crossing it since there was no train coming, and they could not hear any whistle. They slowly climbed the embankment to cross the track, taking care not to drop the baskets. They were very near the track and the little sister was about the cross it, when they heard the distinct horn of a train.\n\nThe older sister got frightened and ran back. She thought that the young one was following her. She turned back and was shocked to see her little sister still crossing the track. \"Come back here, run back fast,\" she screamed.\n\nIt seemed that the little girl could not hear her sister. She was still concentrating on stepping over the track with her little feet, and holding on to the basket. Then she tripped and fell on the track, scattering her mushrooms around. She sat down and began picking them up and putting in her basket.\n\nIn the meanwhile the elder sister had become hysteric. She cried and screamed, calling her little sister to leave the mushrooms and run back, but it seemed as though the little one could not hear her.\n\nThe engine driver panicked on seeing the girl and blew his whistle with all his might, but she appeared not to hear the whistle. Her sister was now crying loudly, overcome by panic, as the little sister crawled between the tracks on her hands and knees, to pick the rest of the mushrooms.\n\nThe engine driver was helpless as it was not possible for him to stop the engine suddenly. He blew the whistle as hard as he could, but the engine rolled over the little girl. The older sister clasped her face with her trembling hands and cried bitterly. The passengers too panicked at the thought of the sight they would have to witness. The guard ran down to the end of the train to see what happened to the little girl. When the train passed, everybody saw her lying very still between the tracks with her face down.\n\nThen she raised her head, sprang to her knees and began gathering the remaining mushrooms.\n\nThe big sister ran towards her, tears streaming down her face. They hugged and kissed each other, crying out of happiness, tears of joy flowing down their little cheeks. Never were two souls so happily united as at that moment. She promised her little sister that thereafter she would hold her hand tightly while crossing the railway line.\n\nThe two sisters then picked all the remaining mushrooms, and hand in hand, solemnly walked back home. They were indeed two souls who had become wiser than their years, in the span of a few minutes."

      "body": "The Legend Of Ylang-Ylang:\n\nAt the beginning when the Sky and the Earth had just parted, most of the plants only had leaves without any flowers. The Jade Emperor ordered the God of Beauty to embellish the Earth.\n\nObeying the order, the God of Beauty took with her the magic brush and the decanter of scents, heading to the Earth. She painted with all her love for every creature on Earth. Soon after, the grounds and gardens were covered with the beautiful, lovely flowers. The brush had accomplished its tasks, but there were not enough fragnances for all the flowers.\n\nThinking for a while, the God decided that she would only give the kindest flowers the precious scents. She asked the Rose, “What would you do if you were to be blessed with a beautiful scent?” “I would ask sister Wind to give it to everybody,” answered the Rose. Satisfied with the answer, the God of Beauty gave the Rose a strong sweet fragnance.\nShe went to Lotus and asked, “What would you do if you were to be blessed with a beautiful scent?” The Lotus inclined her head and replied modestly, “I would use it to spread the seed of kindness into every soul.” The God with pleasure gave the Lotus a delicate fragnance.\n\nNext, she went to Milk Flower and asked, “What would you do if you were to be blessed with a beautiful scent?” “I would fill up the air with my scent, so that I could be recognized even in the dark.” Though the God was not totally satisfied, she still decided to give her an immensely strong fragnance.\n\nSoon, she approached Hibiscus and asked, “What would you do if you were to be blessed with a beautiful scent?” “I already had such a radiant red. With the fragnance, I would be the best of all!” The God sighed and walked away.\n\nAs time went by, she bestowed the fragnances upon different flowers. Finally, there was only one scent left, the Goddess of the Scents. Still the God of Beauty had not found the flower that deserved to have it.\n\nSuddenly, she saw the pure white petals hiding behind the leaves. She hastily asked her, “Ylang-Ylang! What would you do if you were to be blessed with a beautiful scent?” The Ylang-Ylang hesitated a little bit and then replied, “I would be very much grateful but I would rather you gave it to the grass!” “You dare to refuse my favor?” asked the God of Beauty. The flower burst into tears, “At least I grow up high, I’m equal to other flowers.”\n\nYlang-Ylang continued, “Flowers of the grass are stepped on. They are not respected by others, they need to be compensated.” Moved by what Ylang-Ylang said, she told the flower, “Little Ylang-Ylang, you truly deserve your beautiful pure white and this magical fragnance, I’m going to give you. Keep this pure scent and use it well to spread the love among all the creatures on Earth.”\n\nBefore going back to Heaven, the God even gave grass his holy breath that brought about strength and flexibility which kept the grass stand strong before any violent trample. Even, until now, the Ylang-Ylang still cherishes the blessed fragnance. When the summer comes, its little petals timidly open up to spread the beautiful fresh scent.The scent that can even soften the blazing sunlight. And despite being small, the Ylang-Ylang is sometimes considered the Goddess of the Flowers."

      "body": "Fairy Tales - Bonne-biche:\n\nBEAU-MINON had entered by a little passage, which seemed made expressly for him and had probably given notice to someone at the castle, as the gate opened without Blondine having called.\n\nShe entered the court-yard but saw no one.\n\nThe door of the castle opened of itself. Blondine entered the vestibule which was of rare white marble. All the doors of the castle now opened like the first and the princess passed through a suite of beautiful rooms.\n\nAt last, in the back part of a charming salon, furnished with blue and gold, she perceived a white hind, lying upon a bed of fine and fragrant grasses. Beau-Minon stood near her. The pretty hind saw Blondine, arose, and approached her.\n\n“You are most welcome, Blondine, “ said she. “My son Beau-Minon and I have expected you for a long time. “\n\nAt these words, Blondine was very frightened.\n\n“Take courage, princess; you are with friends. I know the king is your father and I love him and I love you also. “\n\n“Oh, madam, “ said Blondine, “if you know the king my father, I pray you to take me to him. My absence must have made him very wretched. “\n\n“My dear Blondine, “ said the hind, whose name was Bonne-Biche, sighing, “it is not in my power to conduct you to your father. You are in the hands of the magician of the Forest of Lilacs. I myself am subject to his power which is superior to mine but I can send soft dreams to your father, which will reassure him as to your fate and let him know that you are safe with me. “\n\n“Oh, madam! “ said Blondine, in an agony of grief, “shall I never again see my father whom I love so tenderly? My poor father! “\n\n“Dear Blondine, do not distress yourself as to the future. Wisdom and prudence are always recompensed. You will see your father again but not now. In the meantime be good and docile. Beau-Minon and 1 will do all in our power to make you happy. “\n\nBlondine sighed heavily and shed a few tears. She then reflected that to manifest such grief was a poor recompense for all the goodness of Bonne-Biche. She resolved, therefore, to control herself and to be cheerful.\n\nBonne-Biche took her to see the apartment they had prepared for her. The bedroom was hung with rose-colored silk embroidered with gold. The furniture was covered with white velvet worked with silks of the most brilliant hues. Every species of animal, bird, and butterfly were represented in rare embroidery.\n\nAdjoining Blondine‘s chamber was a small study. It was hung with sky-blue damask, embroidered with fine pearls. The furniture was covered with silver moire, adorned with nails of turquoise. Two magnificent portraits, representing a young and superbly handsome woman and a strikingly attractive young man, hung on the walls. Their costumes indicated that they were of the royal race.\n\n“Whose portraits are these, madam? “ said Blondine to Bonne-Biche.\n\n“I am forbidden to answer that question, dear Blondine. You will know later, but this is the hour for dinner. Come, Blondine, I am sure you are hungry. “\n\nBlondine was in fact almost dying of hunger. She followed Bonne-Biche and they entered the dining-room where she saw a table strangely served.\n\nAn enormous cushion of black satin was placed on the floor for Bonne-Biche. On the table, before she was a vase filled with the choicest herbs, fresh and nutritious and near this vase was a golden bucket, filled with fresh and limpid water.\n\nOpposite Bonne-Biche was a little stool for Beau-Minon while before he was a little porringer in gold, filled with little fried fish and thighs of snipes. On one side was a bowl of rich crystal full of fresh milk.\n\nBetween Beau-Minon and Bonne-Biche a plate was placed for Blondine. Her chair was of carved ivpry covered with crimson velvet attached with nails of diamonds. Before she was a gold plate richly chased, filled with delicious soup made of a young pullet and fig-birds, her glass and water-bottle were of carved rock-crystal, a muffin was placed by her side, her fork and spoon were of gold and her napkin was of linen, finer than anything she had ever seen.\n\nThe table was served by gazelles who were marvelously adroit. They waited, carved and even divined the wishes of Blondine, Bonne-Biche, and Beau-Minon. The dinner was exquisite, the chicken was splendid, the game and fish most delicate, the pastry and bonbons superlative. Blondine was hungry so she ate of all and found it excellent.\n\nAfter dinner, Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon conducted the princess into the garden.

      "body": "Frederick And Catherine:\n\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said. ‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’ ‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. \n\nThe steak soon began to look brown, and to crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it: then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her head, ‘The dog is not shut up—he may be running away with the steak; that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it.\n\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself.\n\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair, and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! \n\nwe have now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah! well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’\n\nAt noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he, ‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’\n\nThe husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. ‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ \n\n‘Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show: and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me.’\n\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband, ‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’ ‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’\n\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than I have.’ \n\nThen she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them.\n\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’ said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure you never told me not.’\n\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’ said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’\n\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, ‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for I have often seen him take some.’\n\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please.’ \n\n‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so that everybody may go in and out as they please—however, as you have brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’ ‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also—that would be too much of a load; so if you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’\n\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there. Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired; so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’\n\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired; but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well, then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me, it is hailing.’\n\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy: so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’\n\nAt last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound."

Here I caused the death of my friends and here I wish to die. “\n\n“Are you very certain of their death, Blondine? “\n\n“What do you mean? Is it possible I may be deceived?

      "body": "The Clever Jackal Who Was Too Wily:\n\nOne day a clever jackal was wandering about in the forest in search of food. He had not eaten for three days and was extremely hungry. He knew, if this went on for another day, he may die. Therefore, he sat and thought of an idea on how to get some food.\n\nHe was aware that a farmer named Joseph, had a sugarcane field on the border of the forest. Joseph's sugarcane fields had grown and he was planning to harvest them. He had fenced the boundaries of the farm so wild animals would not invade and destroy the sugarcane. Joseph had built a small tree house, so he could stay up there and watch the farm at night.\n\nOne night as he was sitting on his tree house, the clever jackal approached him. He told the farmer, \"Dear Sir, your farm is soon going to be invaded by a huge elephant. There was shortage of food in the forest, so the big elephant living in the forest had decided to invade his farm. So be ready with your weapons.\"\n\nJoseph got worried hearing the Jackal's advise. He had put so much effort in the farm and it would be a pity if the sugarcane fields were destroyed. He was left with no choice, but to take his bow and arrows and lay in wait for any intruders.\n\nAfter visiting Joseph, the clever jackal went to the elephant. The elephant was grazing near a pond. The jackal went up to him and asked, \"Dear Sir, it appears that you are not getting enough food to feed yourself. The problem is that you are a vegetarian and that you eat only a select lot of plants.\"\n\nThe elephant replied, \"You are right. I cannot eat all plants and am forced to travel from forest to forest, in search of food. It is a tedious task and there are days I even go without food. However, this forest is a bit better than the rest.\"\n\nThe clever jackal smiled to himself and said, \"I have some good news for you. There is a place where you can feast for at least one week.\"\n\n\"That's interesting. Please tell me more about it,\" said the elephant.\n\nThe jackal told the elephant all about Joseph's sugarcane fields. He added the harvest was to take place tomorrow or the day after. The sugarcane fields are ripe and will be a real feast for you.\n\nThe Jackal added, \"He has fenced it, but the fence is no match for your might. You can go there tonight and feast until you are full. So don't miss this opportunity.\"\n\nThank you for providing me with this information. \"I shall go there in the evening and creep in at midnight, when the farmer is asleep,\" said the elephant. \"That is a great idea, as Joseph sleeps like a log.\"\n\nThe Jackal then visited the boundary of the field, where a huge and ancient oak tree stood, and was home to many animals. Joseph was standing close to the next tree and it appeared he was making plans for the night. \"What are you doing here\", asked the Jackal.\n\nJoseph replied, \"I am searching for a place where I can have a clear shot at the elephant. \"\n\nThe jackal then advised Joseph to stand under the nearby old oak tree as it had a great view. He added that he could also stand behind the oak tree and the elephant will not be able to see him.\n\nJoseph was happy at the jackal's advise, as he too had thought the same. Therefore, he decided to go to his hut, have an early supper and return.\n\nThe wily jackal then went to the oak tree. He was aware that a snake was staying on the base of the tree. He called out to the snake and told him, \"Dear Sir, you are in great danger. The farmer, who owns the sugarcane field, plans to kill you tonight. Have you ever seen him?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes! Isn't his name Joseph?\"\n\n\"Well, he has decided to destroy you and your family because you are a nuisance to his livestock\", said the jackal.\n\n\"What shall I do my dear jackal? He is big and always carries weapons.\"\n\nThe jackal said, \"Don't worry, he plans to come here tonight and will be hiding behind the tree. Before he can react, go and bite him twice or thrice and that will be the end of Joseph\".\n\nThe jackal wished him success and bade good-bye. He was sure that his plan would work and if all goes well, he would have a dead elephant, man, and snake by the next day. That should be enough meat for a month and a half.\n\nThe elephant as planned slowly entered the sugarcane fields at midnight. The farmer noticing the elephants took out his bow and arrow, and shot three arrows at the elephant. The elephant cried in pain and fell. Joseph got down from the tree and no sooner he stepped down, he felt a sharp pain on his ankles. He felt as if an insect had bitten him a couple of times. Looking down, he saw a snake slithering away. Quickly, he raced after it and trampled it, and the snake was dead. Shortly, Joseph too fell down and died. The elephant also had died by now.\n\nThe jackal slowly ventured close to the hunter. He noticed the bow lying next to the hunter. He bit it to remove it from the way and in the process cut the bowstring. The tension in the string was so much that the sharp end of the bow entered the jackal's throat and that was the end of the wily jackal.\n\nMoral: Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost."

As usual, during work time, they will lay the child under the hedge in the shade; you lie there too, just as if you wished to guard it. Then I will come out of the wood, and carry off the child. You must rush swiftly after me. I will let it fall, and you will take it back to its parents, who will think that you have saved it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm - quite the opposite; you will be dear to their hearts, and they will never let you lack for anything again.”\n\nThe plan pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as it was arranged. The father screamed when he saw the wolf running across the field with his child, but when Old Sultan brought it back, then he was full of joy, and stroked him and said, “Not a hair of yours shall be hurt, you shall eat my bread free as long as you live.” To his wife he said, “Go home at once and make Old Sultan some soggy bread that he will not have to bite, and bring the pillow out of my bed, I will give it to him to lie upon.” From that time on, Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.\n\nSoon afterwards the wolf visited him, and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well. “But, listen well,” said he, “you will just wink an eye when I carry off one of your master’s fat sheep.”\n\n“Do not reckon upon that,” answered the dog. “I will remain true to my master; I cannot agree to that.” The wolf, who thought that this could not be spoken in earnest, came creeping about in the night and was going to take away the sheep. But faithful old Sultan barked, and the farmer chased after the wolf with a big stick. The wolf had to pack off, but he cried out to the dog, “Wait a bit, you scoundrel, you shall pay for this.”\n\nThe next morning the wolf sent the wild boar to challenge the dog to come out into the forest so that they might settle the affair. Old Sultan could find no one to stand by him but a cat with only three legs, and as they went out together the poor cat limped along, and at the same time stretched out her tail into the air with pain.\n\nThe wolf and his friend were already on the spot appointed, but when they saw their enemy coming they thought that he was bringing a sabre with him, for they mistook the outstretched tail of the cat for one. When the poor beast hopped on its three legs, they could only think every time that it was picking up a stone to throw at them. So they were both afraid; the wild boar crept into the under-wood and the wolf jumped up a tree.\n\nThe dog and the cat, when they came up, wondered that there was no one to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to hide himself altogether; and one of his ears was still to be seen. Whilst the cat was looking carefully about, the boar moved his ear. The cat, who thought it was a mouse moving there, jumped upon it and bit it hard. The boar made a fearful noise and ran away, crying out, “The guilty one is up in the tree!” The dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf, who was ashamed of having proved himself to be so afraid, and made friends with the dog."

      "body": "Midsummer-night:\n\nTHE children were very much puzzled what to do, for it was Midsummer-night, and they knew that there was a dream belonging to it; but how to come across it they could not tell. They knew that the dream had something to do with fairies, a queen, and all manner of lovely things; but that was all. At first, they thought they would sit up with the doors and windows open, and the dog on the steps ready to bark if he saw anything unusual.\n\nThen they felt sure that they could not dream while they were wide-awake, so three of them went to bed, and one dozed in a corner of the porch, with her clothes on. Presently the dog barked, and two children in their night-gowns ran out to see, and one took off her night-cap and looked out of the window; but it was only old Nurse coming back from a long gossip with the village blacksmith‘s wife and mother-in-law. So the dog looked foolish, and the Nurse was angry and put them all to bed without any more ado.\n\n“Oh, “ they cried, “but the fairies, and the queen, and the flowers! What shall we do to see them?\n\n“Go to sleep, “ said Nurse, “ and the dream may come to you; you can‘t go to a dream, “ she added, for you see she was just a peasant woman and had never traveled far, or into any land but her own.\n\nSo the children shut their eyes tightly and went to sleep, and I think that they saw something, for their eyes were very bright next morning, and one of them whispered to me, softly, “The queen wore a wreath of flowers last night, dear mother, and, oh, she was very beautiful. “"

      "body": "Fairy Tales - The Journey And Arrival:\n\nTHE journey to Blondine lasted, as the Tortoise had said, six months. They were three months to pass through the forest. At the end of that time, she found herself on an arid plain which required six weeks to cross.\n\nThen Blondine perceived a castle that reminded her of that of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. They spent a full month passing through the avenue to this castle.\n\nBlondine burned with impatience. Would she indeed learn the fate of her dear friends at the palace? In spite of her extreme anxiety, she dared not ask a single question. If she could have descended from the back of the Tortoise, ten minutes would have sufficed for her to reach the castle. But, alas ! the Tortoise crept on slowly and Blondine remembered that she had been forbidden to alight or to utter a word. She resolved, therefore, to control her impatience.\n\nThe tortoise seemed rather relaxed rather than increasing her speed. She consumed fourteen days still passing through this avenue. They seemed fourteen centuries to Blondine. She never, however, lost sight of the castle or of the door. The place seemed deserted; she heard no noise, she saw no sign of life.\n\nAt last, after twenty-four days‘ journey, the Tortoise paused, and said to Blondine:\n\n“Now, princess, descend. By your courage and obedience, you have earned the recompense I promised. Enter the little door which you see before you. The first person you will meet will be the fairy Bienveillante and she will make known to you the fate of your friends. “\n\nBlondine sprang lightly to the earth. She had been immovable so long she feared her limbs would be cramped but on the contrary, she was as light and active as when she had lived so happily with her dear Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon and ran joyously and gracefully gathering flowers and chasing butterflies.\n\nAfter having thanked the Tortoise most warmly she opened the door which had been pointed out to her and found herself before a young person clothed in white, who asked in a sweet voice, whom she desired to see?\n\n“I wish to see the fairy Bienveillante. Tell her, I pray you, miss, that the princess Blondine begs earnestly to see her without delay. “\n\n“Follow me, princess, “ replied the young girl.\n\nBlondine followed in great agitation. She passed through several beautiful rooms and met many young girls clothed in white, like her guide. They looked at her as if they recognized her and smiled graciously.\n\nAt last, Blondine arrived in a room in every respect resembling that of Bonne-Biche in the Forest of Lilacs. The remembrances which this recalled were so painful that she did not perceive the disappearance of her fair young guide.\n\nBlondine gazed sadly at the furniture of the room. She saw but one piece which had not adorned the apartment of Bonne-Biche in the Forest of Lilacs. It was a wardrobe in gold and ivory, exquisitely carved. It was closed. Blondine felt drawn towards it in an inexplicable manner. She was gazing at it intently, not having indeed the power to turn her eyes away, when a door opened and a young and beautiful woman, magnificently dressed, entered and drew near Blondine.\n\n“What do you wish, my child? “ said she, in a sweet, caressing voice.\n\n“Oh, madam! “ said Blondine, throwing herself at her feet, “I have been assured that you could give me news of my dear, kind friends, Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. You know, madam, without doubt by what heedless disobedience I gave them up to destruction and that I wept for them a long time, believing them to be dead but the Tortoise, who conducted me here, has given me a reason to hope I may one day see them again. Tell me, madam, tell me if they yet live and if I may dare hope for the happiness of rejoining them? “\n\n“Blondine, “ replied the fairy Bienveillante, sadly, “y u are now about to know the fate of your friends, but no matter what you see or hear, do not lose courage or hope. “\n\nSaying these words, she seized the trembling Blondine and conducted her in front of the wardrobe which had already so forcibly attracted her attention.\n\n“Blondine, here is the key to this wardrobe. Open it, and be brave! “\n\nShe handed Blondine a gold key. With a trembling hand, the princess opened the wardrobe. What was her anguish when she saw the skins of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon fastened to the wardrobe with diamond nails! At this terrible sight, the unfortunate princess uttered a cry of horror and fell insensible at the feet of the fairy. At this moment the door opened and a prince, beautiful as the day, sprang towards Blondine, saying:\n\n“Oh, my mother! this is too severe a trial for my sweet Blondine! “\n\n“Alas ! my son, my heart also bleeds for her. But you know that this last punishment was indispensable to deliver her forever from the yoke of the cruel genius of the Forest of Lilacs. “\n\nThe fairy Bienveillante now with her wand touched Blondine, who was immediately restored to consciousness but despairing and sobbing convulsively, she exclaimed:\n\n“Let me die at once! My life is odious to me! No hope, no happiness, from this time forth forever for poor Blondine! My friends! my cherished friends! I will join you soon in the land of shadows! “\n\n“Blondine ! ever dear Blondine ! “ said the fairy, clasping her in her arms, “your friends live and love you tenderly. I am Bonne-Biche and this is my son, Beau-Minon. The wicked genius of the Forest of Lilacs, taking advantage of the negligence of my son, obtained dominion over us and forced us into the forms under which you have known us. We could not resume our natural appearance unless you pluck the Rose, which I, knowing it to be your evil genius, retained captive. I placed it as far as possible from the castle in order to withdraw it from your view.\n\nI knew the misfortune to which you would be exposed on delivering your evil genius from his prison and Heaven is my witness, that my son and I would willingly have remained a Hind and a Cat forever in your eyes in order to spare you the cruel tortures to which you have been subjected. Parrot gained you over, in spite of all our precautions. You know the rest, my dear child. But you can never know all that we have suffered in witnessing your tears and your desolation. “\n\nBlondine embraced the Fairy ardently and addressed a thousand questions to her.\n\n“What has become of the gazelles who waited upon us so gracefully? “\n\n“You have already seen them, dear Blondine. They are the young girls who accompanied you. They also were changed when the evil genius gained his power over us. “\n\n“And the good white cow who brought me milk every day? “\n\n“We obtained permission from the Queen of the Fairies to send you this light refreshment. The encouraging words of the Crow also came from us. “\n\n“You, then, madam, also sent me the Tortoise? “\n\n“Yes, Blondine. The Queen of the Fairies, touched by your repentance and your grief, deprived the Evil Genius of the Forest of all power over us on condition of obtaining from you one last proof of submission, compelling you to take this long and fatiguing journey and inflicting the terrible punishment of making you believe that my son and I had died from your imprudence. I implored, entreated the Queen of the Fairies to spare you at least this last anguish but she was inflexible. “\n\nBlondine gazed at her lost friends, listened eagerly to every word and did not cease to embrace those she had feared were eternally separated from her by death. The remembrance of her dear father now presented itself. Prince Parfait understood her secret desire and made it known to his mother, the fairy Bienveillante.\n\n“Prepare yourself, dear Blondine, to see your father. Informed by me, he now expects you.‘*\n\nAt this moment, Blondine found herself in a chariot of gold and pearls, the fairy Bienveillante seated at her right hand, and the prince Parfait at her feet, regarding her kindly and tenderly. The chariot was drawn by four swans of dazzling whiteness. They flew with such rapidity, that five minutes brought them to the palace of King Benin. All the court was assembled about the king, all were expecting the princess Blondine.\n\nWhen the chariot appeared, the cries of joy and welcome were so tumultuous that the swans were confused and almost lost their way. Prince Parfait, who guided them, succeeded in arresting their attention and the chariot drew up at the foot of the grand stairway. King Benin sprang towards Blondine who, jumping lightly from the chariot, threw herself in her father‘s arms. They remained a long time in this position and everybody wept tears of joy.\n\nWhen King Benin had somewhat recovered himself he kissed, respectfully and tenderly, the hand of the good fairy who, after having protected and educated the princess Blondine had now restored her to him. He embraced the prince Parfait whom he found most charming.\n\nThere were eight resplendent gala days in honor of the return of Blondine. At the close of this gay festival, the fairy Bienveillante announced her intention of returning home. But Prince Parfait and Blondine were so melancholy at the prospect of this separation that King Benin resolved they should never quit the place. He wedded the fairy and Blondine became the happy wife of Prince Parfait who was always for her the Beau-Minon of the Forest of Lilacs.\n\nBrunette, whose character had entirely changed, came often to see Blondine. Prince Violent, her husband, became more amiable as Brunette became more gentle and they were very happy.\n\nAs for Blondine, she had no misfortunes, no griefs. She had lovely daughters, who resembled her, and good and handsome sons, the image of their manly father, Prince Parfait. Everybody loved them and everyone connected with them was happy ever after."

I would never like my son to do it at all. “\n\nAfter some time, the hind‘s son came there. The hind wanted to teach him to be courageous. She said, “Son! You have a stout body and strong horns.

The hind got ready to run away when her son asked her to stay on. She said, “You may, but I have no horns. “\n\nSaying so, she ran as fast as she could.\n\nThe mother herself was a coward and was teaching courage to her son. What a satire!\n\nThe End."

      "body": "The Goose-girl:\n\nThere once lived an old queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter. When the princess grew up she was promised in marriage to a prince who lived far away. When the time came for her to be married, and she had to depart for the distant kingdom, the old queen packed up for her many costly vessels and utensils of silver and gold, and trinkets also of gold and silver, and cups and jewels, in short, everything that belonged to a royal dowry, for she loved her child with all her heart.\n\nShe likewise assigned to her a chambermaid, who was to ride with her, and deliver her into the hands of the bridegroom. Each received a horse for the journey. The princess's horse was called Falada, and could speak. When the hour of departure had come, the old mother went into her bedroom, took a small knife and cut her fingers with it until they bled. Then she held out a small white cloth and let three drops of blood fall into it. She gave them to her daughter, saying, \"Take good care of these. They will be of service to you on your way.\"\n\nThus they sorrowfully took leave of one another. The princess put the cloth into her bosom, mounted her horse, and set forth for her bridegroom. After they had ridden for a while she felt a burning thirst, and said to her chambermaid, \"Dismount, and take my cup which you have brought with you for me, and get me some water from the brook, for I would like a drink.\"\n\n\"If you are thirsty,\" said the chambermaid, \"get off your horse yourself, and lie down near the water and drink. I won't be your servant.\"\n\nSo in her great thirst the princess dismounted, bent down over the water in the brook and drank; and she was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup. Then she said, \"Oh, Lord,\" and the three drops of blood answered, \"If your mother knew this, her heart would break in two.\"\n\nBut the king's daughter was humble. She said nothing and mounted her horse again. They rode some miles further. The day was warm, the sun beat down, and she again grew thirsty. When they came to a stream of water, she again called to her chambermaid, \"Dismount, and give me some water in my golden cup,\" for she had long ago forgotten the girl's evil words.\n\nBut the chambermaid said still more haughtily, \"If you want a drink, get it yourself. I won't be your servant.\"\n\nThen in her great thirst the king's daughter dismounted, bent over the flowing water, wept, and said, \"Oh, Lord,\" and the drops of blood again replied, \"If your mother knew this, her heart would break in two.\"\n\nAs she was thus drinking, leaning over the stream, the cloth with the three drops of blood fell from her bosom and floated away with the water, without her taking notice of it, so great were her concerns. However, the chambermaid what happened, and she rejoiced to think that she now had power over the bride, for by losing the drops of blood, the princess had become weak and powerless.\n\nWhen she wanted to mount her horse again, the one that was called Falada, the chambermaid said, \"I belong on Falada. You belong on my nag,\" and the princess had to accept it.\n\nThen with many harsh words the chambermaid ordered the princess to take off her own royal clothing and put on the chambermaid's shabby clothes. And in the end the princess had to swear under the open heaven that she would not say one word of this to anyone at the royal court. If she had not taken this oath, she would have been killed on the spot. Falada saw everything, and remembered it well.\n\nThe chambermaid now climbed onto Falada, and the true bride onto the bad horse, and thus they traveled onwards, until finally they arrived at the royal palace. There was great rejoicing over their arrival, and the prince ran ahead to meet them, then lifted the chambermaid from her horse, thinking she was his bride.\n\nShe was led upstairs, while the real princess was left standing below. Then the old king looked out of the window and saw her waiting in the courtyard, and noticed how fine and delicate and beautiful she was, so at once he went to the royal apartment, and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was standing down below in the courtyard, and who she was.\n\n\"I picked her up on my way for a companion. Give the girl some work to do, so she won't stand idly by.\"\n\nHowever, the old king had no work for her, and knew of nothing else to say but, \"I have a little boy who tends the geese. She can help him.\" The boy was called Kürdchen (Little Conrad), and the true bride had to help him tend geese.\n\nSoon afterwards the false bride said to the young king, \"Dearest husband, I beg you to do me a favor.\"\n\nHe answered, \"I will do so gladly.\"\n\n\"Then send for the knacker, and have the head of the horse which I rode here cut off, for it angered me on the way.\" In truth, she was afraid that the horse might tell how she had behaved toward the king's daughter.\n\nThus it happened that faithful Falada had to die. The real princess heard about this, and she secretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would perform a small service for her. In the town there was a large dark gateway, through which she had to pass with the geese each morning and evening. Would he be so good as to nail Falada's head beneath the gateway, so that she might see him again and again?\n\nThe knacker's helper promised to do that, and cut off the head, and nailed it securely beneath the dark gateway.\n\nEarly in the morning, when she and Conrad drove out their flock beneath this gateway, she said in passing, \"Alas, Falada, hanging there!\"\n\nThen the head answered:\n\nAlas, young queen, passing by,\nIf this your mother knew,\nHer heart would break in two.\nThen they went still further out of the town, driving their geese into the country. And when they came to the meadow, she sat down and unbound her hair which was of pure gold. Conrad saw it, was delighted how it glistened, and wanted to pluck out a few hairs. Then she said:\n\nBlow, wind, blow,\nTake Conrad's hat,\nAnd make him chase it,\nUntil I have braided my hair,\nAnd tied it up again.\nThen such a strong wind came up that it blew Conrad's hat across the fields, and he had to run after it. When he came back, she was already finished combing and putting up her hair, so he could not get even one strand. So Conrad became angry, and would not speak to her, and thus they tended the geese until evening, and then they went home.\n\nThe next morning when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway, the maiden said, \"Alas, Falada, hanging there!\"\n\nFalada answered:\n\nAlas, young queen, passing by,\nIf this your mother knew,\nHer heart would break in two.\nShe sat down again in the field and began combing out her hair. When Conrad ran up and tried to take hold of some, she quickly said:\n\nBlow, wind, blow,\nTake Conrad's hat,\nAnd make him chase it,\nUntil I have braided my hair,\nAnd tied it up again.\nThen the wind blew, taking the hat off his head and far away. Conrad had to run after it, and when he came back, she had already put up her hair, and he could not get a single strand. Then they tended the geese until evening.\n\nThat evening, after they had returned home, Conrad went to the old king and said, \"I won't tend geese with that girl any longer.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the old king.\n\n\"Oh, because she angers me all day long.\"\n\nThen the old king ordered him to tell what it was that she did to him. Conrad said, \"In the morning when we pass beneath the dark gateway with the flock, there is a horse's head on the wall, and she says to it, 'Alas, Falada, hanging there!' And the head replies:\n\nAlas, young queen, passing by,\nIf this your mother knew,\nHer heart would break in two.\"\nThen Conrad went on to tell what happened at the goose pasture, and how he had to chase his hat.\n\nThe old king ordered him to drive his flock out again the next day. As soon as morning came, he himself sat down behind the dark gateway, and heard how the girl spoke with Falada's head. Then he followed her out into the country and hid himself in a thicket in the meadow. There he soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringing their flock, and how after a while she sat down and took down her hair, which glistened brightly. Soon she said:\n\nBlow, wind, blow,\nTake Conrad's hat,\nAnd make him chase it,\nUntil I have braided my hair,\nAnd tied it up again.\nThen came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad's hat, so that he had to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and braiding her hair, all of which the king observed. Then, quite unseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home in the evening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these things.\n\n\"I am not allowed to tell you, nor can I reveal my sorrows to any human being, for I have sworn under the open heaven not to do so, and if I had not so sworn, I would have been killed.\"\n\nHe urged her and left her no peace, but he could get nothing from her. Finally he said, \"If you will not tell me anything, then tell your sorrows to the iron stove there,\" and he went away.\n\nSo she crept into the iron stove, and began to cry sorrowfully, pouring out her whole heart. She said, \"Here I sit, abandoned by the whole world, although I am the daughter of a king. A false chambermaid forced me to take off my royal clothes, and she has taken my place with my bridegroom. Now I have to do common work as a goose-girl. If my mother this, her heart would break in two.\"\n\nThe old king was standing outside listening by the stovepipe, and he heard what she said. Then he came back inside, and asked her to come out of the stove. Then they dressed her in royal clothes, and it was marvelous how beautiful she was.\n\nThe old king summoned his son and revealed to him that he had a false bride who was only a chambermaid, but that the true one was standing there, the one who had been a goose-girl. The young king rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and virtue. A great feast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends were invited.\n\nAt the head of the table sat the bridegroom with the king's daughter on one side of him, and the chambermaid on the other. However, the chambermaid was deceived, for she did not recognize the princess in her dazzling attire. After they had eaten and drunk, and were in a good mood, the old king asked the chambermaid as a riddle, what punishment a person deserved who had deceived her master in such and such a manner, then told the whole story, asking finally, \"What sentence does such a person deserve?\"\n\nThe false bride said, \"She deserves no better fate than to be stripped stark naked, and put in a barrel that is studded inside with sharp nails. Two white horses should be hitched to it, and they should drag her along through one street after another, until she is dead.\"\n\n\"You are the one,\" said the old king, \"and you have pronounced your own sentence. Thus shall it be done to you.\"\n\nAfter the sentence had been carried out, the young king married his true bride, and both of them ruled over their kingdom in peace and happiness."

The tree was full of ripe mangoes. Rehman was about to take some fruits when Abu came there.\n\n“Hey, don’t touch them. The tree belongs to me,” shouted Abu. “No, it belongs to me,” cried Rehman. They continued arguing for a long time until Rehman suggested to put an end to their argument. “We will go to Birbal, the great, who will judge us fair and  square!” suggested Rehman.\n\nThey both came to Birbal seeking justice. Abu said, “Sir, there is a big mango tree on the edge of my farm. It has always belong to me. Now Rehman claims it is his!” Then, Rehman said, “Sir, it belongs to me! I have been watering it right from the time it was a sapling!” Birbal thought for a while and said, “You may go home now. But present yourselves here tomorrow!”\n\nAs soon as the two farmers left, Birbal sent for a trusted servant and ordered, “Go to their houses in the evening and tell them that some thieves are stealing mangoes from the tree. Report their reactions to me!”\n\nThe servant first went to Abu and said, “Sir, the mangoes are being stolen!” “I have some urgent work now. I will look into the matter later,” said Abu. The servant then set off to Rehman. He told him, “Sir, the mangoes are being stolen!” When Rehman heard the news, he ran towards the tree with a stick. The servant went back and reported everything to Birbal.\n\nNext day at Birbal’s court, he asked again that to whom the tree belonged to. But both of them said, “To me!” Birbal said, “Since I find it difficult to settle this dispute, I order that the mangoes be plucked and divided equally between the two. As far as the tree goes, it will be cut down and the woods too will be equally divided!”\n\nAbu felt happy because he is getting both mango and a part of the tree. On the other hand, Rehman felt sad. Abu said, “You are fair and just, Sir!” “Sir, I have watered and cared for the tree for more than ten years. I can’t see it destroyed. Let Abu take the tree!” requested Rehman.\n\nAfter listening both of them, Birbal concluded that Rehman is the rightful owner and Abu was punished for telling a lie."

      "body": "The Clever Jackal And The Foolish Donkey:\n\nThis is a short bedtime story of an aged lion who had a clever jackal for a servant. The jackal was also a bit old and he was only happy to be the lion's servant. Whenever the lion killed an animal, he would first have his fill and leave the rest for the wily jackal.\n\nIt so happened that one day the lion was very hungry and attacked a huge king elephant. The tusker got angry and injured the lion so bad that he could barely walk. Since the lion could not hunt, both, the jackal were starving. The lion asked the jackal to use his wile to try and trap some animal.\n\nThe lion told the jackal, \"Use your wile and bring me an unsuspecting animal that I could kill without much effort. Otherwise we would die starving.\"\n\nThe clever jackal thought for a while and came up with an idea. He slowly got up to search for an unsuspecting animal. He came across many animals, but it was obvious that his master, the lion, would be unable to kill them. They were either too fast and some of them were even stronger than his master, in his present condition.\n\nFinally, he saw a donkey grazing by the side of the river. The river was almost arid and the grass was mostly dry. It was evident the donkey was hungry.\n\nThe wily jackal was thrilled. He thought, \"This jack is precisely the animal that I need.\"\n\nHe quietly walked toward the donkey and greeted him. He said, \"Dear Sir, you look tired and worried. Is there anything wrong? Can I help you in any way?\"\n\nThe donkey replied, \"I am hungry and have not eaten for a few days.\"\n\nThe wily jackal quickly sympathized with him and said, \"Oh, that's terrible. Why don't you come with me to the forest? The grass is green and there is a river next to my cave. You also don't have to worry about any wild animals, because my cave is far from where the wild animals live. Besides, the smaller animals that live besides the river are very friendly.\"\n\nThe foolish donkey thought for a while and looked a bit apprehensive.\n\nThe wily jackal cautiously said, \"Your master will not find our place. There are also many animals of your kind living there. There are she-donkeys (jenny's) there, who haven't seen a male donkey (jack).\"\n\nThe lovesick jack immediately said, \"Come on, I have heard enough. Lead me to your place and let me meet my new friends.\"\n\nTogether they left for the hungry lion's den. The lion saw them approaching and was happy that he had a clever jackal for a servant. As a result, the moment they reached close to the den, the hungry lion leaped at the donkey. The lion, out of haste missed his target, landed on some rocks, and further hurt himself. The terrified donkey took to his heels.\n\nThe jackal was angry and swore at the lion, \"Impatient fool, couldn't he have waited a bit longer?\"\n\nHowever, the lion replied regretfully, \"I was so hungry that I got desperate. I did not expect that you would return so quickly. I apologize.\"\n\nThe jackal shouted at the lion, \"You couldn't kill a foolish donkey. How did you ever think of attacking a king elephant?\"\n\n\"Not to worry, I will bring him back, but be prepared this time\", said the wily jackal.\n\nThe lion was shocked, and said, \"How are you going to bring him back? He would have reached his home by now.\"\n\nThe jackal said, \"Leave that to me and don't act hasty.\" He then left in search of the donkey.\n\nHe found him, next to the river drinking. He was still breathing hard as he left the place so fast.\n\nHe said, \"You are nothing but a scheming, wily jackal. If I had not bent down, I would have been dead by now.\"\n\nThe clever jackal; started laughing so hard.\n\n\"What are you laughing at? Asked the donkey.\n\nThe jackal curbed his laughter and said, \"My dear sir, that was a she-donkey. She has been lovesick for some time now. She could not believe, when she saw you walking up the hill, and wanted you for herself. She sprang to hug you, but you fled.\"\n\nI told her that you were a shy person and she should not have acted in haste. The foolish donkey could not believe what he just heard.\n\n\"Come on, let's not waste any time. They are all waiting for you,\" said the wily jackal.\n\n\"Alright, if you say so. Lead the way, brother jackal\", said the donkey.\n\nThe lion was shocked to see the clever jackal and the foolish donkey return. However, this time, the lion did not make any mistake. He waited until the donkey reached his cave and quickly finished him.\n\nThe lion then went to freshen up before his meal and asked the jackal to keep watch. The clever jackal was ravenous and had other plans. He quickly ate the heart and ears of the donkey, before the lion returned.\n\nThe lion returned and was furious to note that the best parts were missing. He shouted at the jackal, \"Where are the other parts. Who ate them, while I was away?\"\n\nThe jackal remained calm and said, \"Do you thing that this foolish donkey had these parts. If he had them, do you think he would have ever returned?\"\n\nThe lion did not bother to further question the clever jackal, as he was ravenous, and quickly began eating.\n\nMoral: If you can hold your head in the face of disasters, then you would be able to defeat them."

      "body": "The Tale of the Dog, Cock and the Fox:\n\nA dog and a cock, who were the best of friends, decided to leave their farm as they wanted to travel and see the world.\n\nThey were curious and wanted to see what was there beyond their farm. So, they decided to leave the farmyard, and set out along the road that led to the woods, that would lead them on their path to see the world. The two friends were extremely happy about their decision to travel to see the world, and were hoping for many adventures on their way.\n\nAs night approached, the cock, searched for a place to roost as was his usual custom. He spotted a tall, hollow tree, on the border of the forest, and felt that the tree would be an excellent place for spending the night. The cock also thought that his friend, the dog could sleep inside the hollow base of the tree. And as per plan, the dog slept below, and the cock flew to one of the branches, and spent the night there. Both having found a safe and nice place to rest, they slept comfortably.\n\nAs the first glimmer of dawn approached, the cock forgot for a moment where he was. He woke up thinking that he was still at the farmyard. As it was his duty to arouse and wake the rest of the animals at the farm at daybreak, he stood tip-toes on the branch, flapped his wings, and crowed proudly. Having crowed two or three times, he suddenly realized that he was not at the farm anymore, and stopped crowing.\n\nHowever, the damage had been done, and instead of waking the farm animals and the farmer, he had awakened a fox, who was not too far in the woods.\n\nThe fox was hungry as he had not eaten anything the previous day, and was on the lookout for a prey. He saw the rooster perched high on the tree, and had rosy visions of a delicious breakfast. However, the fox noticed how high the cock was positioned, and was thinking of a plan to bring down the rooster, so as to kill him for his breakfast...\n\nHe immediately hurried to where the rooster was, and said very politely\" a humble welcome to our forest, dear sir! I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you in our forest. I am sure that we can become the best of friends.\"\n\nThe cock realizing that something was afoot, asked the fox, \"why, how can that be possible?\"\n\nThe fox very calmly told the rooster, \"Have you not heard about the new decree of peace and harmony that was recently issued by the lion, the king of the jungle.\"\n\nThe rooster replied \"no, I haven't, but what is this decree all about?\"\n\nThe fox added that the new treaty issued by the king lion, emphasizes that, all beasts, birds and every other creature in our forest, shall not hurt each other, but instead, should live in peace and universal brotherhood\".\n\nHence, we are not supposed to hunt, hurt or prey upon one another, but instead live in peace and harmony. So, please do come down and we can discuss this matter of such great importance.\n\nBy now, the rooster had realized that the cunning fox was up to something and did not say anything, but kept looking at the bottom of the tree, as if he was searching for someone.\n\nNoticing this, the fox asked the rooster, whether he had lost something or searching for someone.\n\nThe rooster replied that he was flattered to hear the new decree and requested the fox to go to the bottom of the tree and wake his friend, and convey this news to him.\n\nThe hungry and unsuspecting fox, thinking that there were other roosters down below, rushed to the tree's hollow, as advised by the rooster, and was a bit taken aback to see the sleeping dog.\n\nNoticing the dog, the fox immediately started running to the forest.\n\nThe rooster called out to the fox and said, \"Please don't go... the dog was his master's pet, and that he was also a good friend of the rooster's.\"\n\nThe rooster continued, \"I was just on my way down. We shall wait for my friend the dog, to wake up, and we shall discuss about this new treaty that the king lion has issued, and celebrate the new reign of universal peace.\"\n\nThe fox who, was already on the run said, \"I would be happy to meet and greet your friend, but I am afraid, that he may not have heard about the king lion's new treaty of peace.\"\n\nMoral: It is obvious that cunning often outfoxes itself, and that those who try to cheat others, would likely be paid in their own coin."

      "body": "The Little Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe:\n\nOnce on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. This shoe stood near a great forest, and was so large that it served as a house for the Old Lady and all her children, of which she had so many that she did not know what to do with them.\n\nBut the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children, and they only thought of the best way to please her. Strong-arm, the eldest, cut down trees for firewood. Peter made baskets of wicker-work. Mark was chief gardener. Lizzie milked the cow, and Jenny taught the younger children to read.\n\nNow this Little Old Woman had not always lived in a Shoe. She and her family had once dwelt in a nice house covered with ivy, and her husband was a wood-cutter, like Strong-arm. But there lived in a huge castle beyond the forest, a fierce giant, who one day came and laid their house in ruins with his club; after which he carried off the poor wood-cutter to his castle beyond the forest. When the Little Old Woman came home, her house was in ruins and her husband was no where to be seen.\n\nNight came on, and as the father did not return, the Old Lady and her family went to search for him. When they came to that part of the wood where the Giant had met their father, they saw an immense shoe. They spent a long time weeping and calling out for their father, but met with no reply. Then the Old Lady thought that they had better take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house. So Peter and Strong-arm put a roof to it, and cut a door, and turned it into a dwelling. Here they all lived happily for many years, but the Little Old Lady never forgot her husband and his sad fate. Strong-arm, who saw how wretched his mother often was about it, proposed to the next eleven brothers that they should go with him and set their father free from the Giant. Their mother knew the Giant's strength, and would not hear of the attempt, as she feared they would be killed. But Strong-arm was not afraid. He bought a dozen sharp swords, and Peter made as many strong shields and helmets, as well as cross-bows and iron-headed arrows. They were now quite ready; Strong-arm gave the order to march, and they started for the forest. The next day they came in sight of the Giant's Castle. Strong-arm, leaving his brothers in a wood close by, strode boldly up to the entrance, and seized the knocker. The door was opened by a funny little boy with a large head, who kept grinning and laughing.\n\nStrong-arm then walked boldly across the court-yard, and presently met a page, who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted. Strong-arm said he had come to liberate his father, who was kept a prisoner by the Giant; on this the little man said he was sorry for him, because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was guarded by a large dragon. Strong-arm, nothing daunted, soon found the monster, who was fast asleep, so he made short work of him by sending his sword right through his heart; at which he jumped up, uttering a loud scream, and made as if he would spring forward and seize Strong-arm; but the good sword had done its work, and the monster fell heavily on the ground, dead.\n\nNow the Giant, who had been drinking much wine, was fast asleep in a remote part of the castle. Strong-arm had no sooner finished the Dragon, than up started the funny little boy who had opened the door. He led Strong-arm round to another part of the court-yard, where he saw his poor father, who at once sprung to his feet, and embraced him. Then Strong-arm called up his brothers, and when they had embraced their father, they soon broke his chain and set him free.\n\nWe must now return to the Little Old Woman. After her sons had started she gave way to the most bitter grief. While she was in this state, an old witch came up to her, and said she would help her, as she hated the Giant, and wished to kill him. The Old Witch then took the little Old Lady on her broom, and they sailed off through the air, straight to the Giant's castle.\n\nNow this old Witch had great power, and at once afflicted the Giant with corns and tender feet. When he awoke from his sleep he was in such pain that he could bear it no longer, so he thought he would go in search of his missing shoe, which, like the other one he had in his castle, was easy and large for his foot. When he came to the spot where the Old Lady and her children lived, he saw his old shoe, and with a laugh that shook the trees, he thrust his foot into it, breaking through the roof that Strong-arm and Peter had put to it. The children, in great alarm, rushed about inside the shoe, and frightened and trembling, scrambled through the door and the slits which the Giant had formerly made for his corns. By this time the witch and the Little Old Lady, as also Strong-arm, his eleven brother and his father, were come up to the spot. Strong-arm and his brothers shot their arrows at him till at last he fell wounded, when Strong-arm went up to him and cut off his head. Then the father and the Little Old Woman and all their children built a new house, and lived happily ever afterwards."

      "body": "Clever Elsie:\n\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’ said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans; but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. \n\n‘Oh,’ said the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’ ‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she went, so that the time might not appear long. \n\nWhen she was below she fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there.\n\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her. \n\nThose upstairs waited for the drink, but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while, as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together. \n\nThen he asked: ‘Why are you weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. \n\nThen said the mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat down, and likewise wept with them. \n\nThe bridegroom stayed upstairs alone for along time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’ When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each out- doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\n\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first? I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep. Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away, Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep. \n\nThen Hans hastened home and brought a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought: ‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’ answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said: ‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since."

      "body": "The Old Street Lamp:\n\nHave you ever heard the story of the old Street Lamp? It's really not very amusing, but you might listen to it for once.\n\nIt was such an honest lamp, which had done its duty for many, many years and which was now going to be discarded. It was the last evening it hung on its post and gave light to the street beneath it. The Lamp felt like an old ballet dancer who is performing for the last time and who knows that tomorrow she will be in a cold garret. The Lamp dreaded the morrow, for then it was to appear in the town hall and be inspected by the thirty-six council members, to see whether or not it was fit for further service.\n\nIt would be decided whether in the future the Lamp was to give light for the inhabitants of some suburb, or perhaps for some manufacturing plant in the country. But it might go at once to be melted down in an iron foundry! In that case it might become anything, but the Lamp was terribly troubled wondering whether, in some new state, it would remember it had once been a Street Lamp. In any case, the Lamp would be separated from the watchman and his wife, whom it had come to consider part of its family. It became a Lamp at the same time that he became a watchman.\n\nIn those days the watchman's wife was a little haughty. She would glance at the Lamp only when she passed under it in the evening-never in the daytime. However, in later years, when those three, the watchman, his wife, and the Lamp, had grown old together, the wife helped tend the Lamp, clean it, and poured oil into it. The old couple were thoroughly honest; never had they cheated the Lamp of a single drop of oil.\n\nNow it was the Lamp's last night in the street, and tomorrow it would go to the town hall. Those were two dark thoughts indeed, and it's no wonder the old Lamp didn't burn very brightly. But other thoughts too passed through its mind. How many events it had lighted, how much it had seen of life! Perhaps as much as the thirty-six councilmen put together. But it didn't really say anything, for it was a good, honest old Lamp, and wouldn't willingly insult anyone-least of all those in authority. It remembered so much, and now and then its flame flashed up as if the Lamp had the feeling: \"Yes, I will also be remembered.\"\n\n\"There was that handsome young man-my, it was a long time ago! He came with a letter, written on pink paper, so fine and gilt-edged, so prettily written by a lady's hand. Twice he read it, and kissed it, and as he looked up to me his eyes said, 'I'm the happiest person in the world!' Yes, only he and I knew what was written in that first letter from his beloved.\n\n\"I also remember another pair of eyes - it's strange how my thoughts are rambling! Here in this street was a magnificent funeral procession, a beautiful young maiden lying in a coffin on the velvet-covered hearse. There were many wreaths and flowers, and the many torches quite overpowered my light. The sidewalk was filled with people who all followed the procession. But after the torches had passed me, and I looked around, I could see one single person, leaning against my post and weeping. I shall never forget the eyes that looked up at me then!\"\n\nMany thoughts flitted through the mind of the old Street Lamp, for tonight it shone for the last time.\n\nThe sentry who is relieved of his post at least knows his successor, and may say a few words to him; but the Lamp did not know who would succeed it. It could have given one or two useful hints about rain and mist, how far the rays of the moon lit up the pavement, and from what direction the wind blew.\n\nOn the gutter plank stood three individuals who had introduced themselves to the Lamp, because they thought it was the Lamp that could choose its successor. One of them was a herring's head, and because it could gleam in the darkness, it was sure there would be a real saving in oil if they would put him up on the lamppost. The second was a piece of touchwood, which also glowed, and certainly better than a herring's head, at least so it said. Furthermore, it was the last descendant of an old stem, once the pride of the forest. And the third was a glow-worm. Where that had come from the Lamp couldn't imagine; but there it was, and it could give light too. But the herring's head and the touchwood swore it could do so only at certain times, and therefore could not be taken into account.\n\nThe old Lamp said that not one of them gave enough light to fulfill the duties of a street lamp; but they wouldn't believe it. And when they heard that the Lamp had nothing to do with appointing its successor, they were much relieved and said the Lamp was much too decrepit to make a choice.\n\nJust then the Wind came tearing around the street corner, and whistled through the air holes of the Lamp, and said to it: \"What's this I hear? Are you going away tomorrow? Is this the last evening I'll see you here? Then I'm certainly going to give you a farewell present. I'll blow into your brain box so that in the future you'll be able not only to remember everything you've seen and heard, but you'll also have such a light within you that you can see all that is read or spoken in your presence.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's way too much!\" said the old Lamp. \"Thank you very much! I only hope I'm not going to be melted down!\"\n\n\"That won't happen right away,\" said the Wind. \"Now I'll blow a memory into you; if you receive several presents like this, you'll have a happy old age.\"\n\n\"If only I'm not melted down!\" said the Lamp. \"Or can you guarantee my memory even in that case?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, old Lamp!\" said the Wind, and then it blew. At that moment the Moon came out.\n\n\"What are you going to give?\" asked the Wind.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" replied the Moon. \"I'm on the wane, and besides the lamps have never lighted me. On the contrary, I've often given light for the lamps.\" Whereupon it slid behind the clouds again, for it didn't want to be pestered.\n\nNow a drop fell on the Lamp. It seemed to come from the roof, but it explained that the gray clouds sent it as a present-perhaps the best possible present. \"I'll penetrate you so completely that you'll be able, if you wish, to turn into rust in one night, and then crumble into dust.\"\n\nBut the Lamp thought this was a poor present, and so did the Wind.\n\n\"Isn't someone going to give something better?\" it blew as loudly as it could.\n\nJust then a bright shooting star fell, blazing down in a long bright stripe.\n\n\"What was that?\" cried the herring's head. \"Wasn't that a falling star? Why, I think it went right into the Lamp! Well, if such a highborn personage as that is trying for his position we'd better quit and go home!\" And so it did, and the others too. But the old Lamp shone more marvelously than ever.\n\n\"That was a wonderful present!\" it said. \"The bright stars that I've always admired and that shine far more brightly than I ever have been able to, despite my ambition and efforts, have actually noticed me, a poor old lamp, and have sent me a present! They have granted that everything I remember and see as clearly as if it stood before me shall also be seen by those I love! And in that lies true happiness; for if we cannot share happiness with others, it can only be half enjoyed.\"\n\n\"Those are very honorable thoughts,\" said the Wind. \"But for that you need wax lights. Without a wax candle lit up in you, your rare faculties will be of no use to others. The stars didn't think of that! They think everything that shines has at least one wax light in it always. But now I am tired! I am going to lie down.\" And then the Wind lay down.\n\nThe next day-well, we'd better pass over the next day. But the next evening, the Lamp was resting in a big easy chair. And where? In the old watchman's house!\n\nThe old man had begged as a favor of the thirty-six councilmen that he be allowed to keep the Lamp as a reward for his long and faithful service to the city. They laughed at him when he asked for it, but finally gave it to him.\n\nNow the Lamp lay in the big armchair close to the warm stove, and it seemed to be much larger. It almost filled the whole chair. As the old couple sat at supper they looked fondly at the old Lamp and would gladly have given it a place at their table.\n\nIt is true that their home was only a cellar two yards below the sidewalk, and that one had to walk through a stone-paved front room to get into their room, but inside it was very comfortable. There were strips of list on the door, and everything looked clean and neat, with curtains around the bed and over the little windows. On the window sill stood two strange flowerpots. Sailor Christian had brought them home from the East or West Indies. They were made of clay and represented two elephants, with their backs cut off. From the earth in one of the elephants there grew the most excellent chives, and that was the old people's vegetable garden; in the other was a great blooming geranium, and that was the flower garden. On the wall hung a large colored print of the Congress of Vienna; there you could see all the Kings and Emperors at once. There was a Bornholm clock with heavy lead weights that went \"tick! tock!\" It was always a little fast, but that was much better than having it a little slow, said the old people.\n\nThey were eating their supper, and the Street Lamp lay, as you know, in the big armchair close to the warm stove. It seemed to the Lamp as if the whole world were turned upside down. But when the old watchman looked at it, and talked of all they had gone through together in rain and in mist, in the short bright summer nights, and when the snow beat down and he longed for his home in the cellar, then the old Lamp felt all right again. It could see everything as clearly as if it were happening then; yes, the Wind had certainly given it a splendid light.\n\nThe old people were always active and industrious; not a single hour was wasted in idleness. Sunday afternoons the old man would bring out some book or other-generally a volume of travels. And he would read aloud about Africa, about great jungles, with elephants running about wild, and the old woman would listen closely and peer at the clay-elephant flowerpots. \"I can almost visualize it myself,\" she would say.\n\nThen the lamp would wish most particularly that a wax candle had been lighted inside it, for then the old woman would have been able to see everything in detail, just as the Lamp saw it- the tall trees with their great branches all entwined, the naked, black men riding horseback, and big herds of elephants, crushing the reeds and bushes with their huge feet.\n\n\"What good are all my faculties if I can't get a wax light?\" sighed the Lamp. \"They have only oil and tallow candle here, and they won't do.\"\n\nOne day the old man brought a number of wax-candle ends down into the cellar. The larger pieces were burned, and the smaller ones were used by the old woman for waxing her thread when she was sewing. There were plenty of wax candles then, but no one thought of putting a little piece into the Lamp.\n\n\"Here I am, with all my rare faculties!\" said the Lamp. \"I have everything within me, but I can't share it with those I love. They don't know that I can cover these white walls with the most gorgeous tapestry, or change them into noble forests, or show them anything they could wish to see! They don't know that!\"\n\nThe Lamp stood neat and scoured in a corner, where it always caught the eyes of visitor, and although people considered it a piece of rubbish, the old couple didn't care; they loved the Lamp.\n\nOne day-it was the old watchman's birthday-the old woman went to the Lamp, smiling a little to herself. \"I'll light it today, in his honor,\" she said.\n\nThen the Lamp rattled its metal cover, for it thought, \"At last they have a fine idea!\" But it was only oil, and no wax candle. The Lamp burned throughout that whole evening, but now it understood at last that the gift the stars had given it, the best of all gifts, would be a lost treasure for all its life.\n\nThat night the Lamp had a dream, for with such faculties it is easy enough to dream. It seemed as if the old people were dead and the Lamp itself sent to the iron foundry to be melted down. It was as frightened as on that dreadful day when it appeared in the council hall to be inspected by the thirty-six council members.\n\nBut though it had the power to crumble into rust and dust at will, it did not use that faculty. It was put into a furnace, and cast into as beautiful an iron candlestick as you could wish-and it was a candlestick for wax lights! It was in the form of an angel holding a bouquet; and the wax candle was to be placed right in the middle of the bouquet.\n\nThe candlestick had a place of its own on a green writing table. And the room was very cozy, its walls lined with many books and hung with beautiful pictures-the room of a poet. Everything that the poet wrote about appeared near him. The room became thick dark forests, beautiful meadows where storks strutted, and then the deck of a ship sailing high on the foaming ocean.\n\n\"What power are hidden in me!\" said the old Lamp, as it awoke from its dream. \"I could almost wish to be melted down! But no, that must not happen so long as the old people live. They love me for myself. I am their child, and they have cleaned me and given me oil. I'm as happy now as the whole Congress of Vienna, and that it something really elegant.\"\n\nAnd from that day on, it enjoyed more inner peace, and that the modest old Lamp well deserved."

      "body": "The Turnip:\n\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips.\n\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’\n\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune; I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’\n\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\n\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be wroth?\n\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.\n\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\n\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out his head.\n\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’\n\nThen the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel and own the power of knowledge.\n\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said, ‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me.’\n\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he, ‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace, till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’\n\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down."

      "body": "The Tale of the Foolish Gardener:\n\nAt the border of a forest, a landlord had a big garden, which he liked very much. As he couldn't look after it himself, he appointed a gardener to take care of the garden. The gardener was very faithful, and looked after the garden very well.\n\nHowever, it was the summer season and he had to water the plants daily. As a result, there was no holiday for him, because, if he ever took leave, even for a day, most of the plants would dry up. Whenever, he approached the landlord with a request to take even a day off, the landlord would puff up and say, \"Who would water the plants in your absence? As there is no one else to water the plants in your absence, I am afraid; I cannot grant you any leave\". The gardener was frightened and had no reply. And as a result, he had to give up the thought of taking any day off.\n\nAnd hence the drudgery continued.\n\nOne day, as the annual temple festival was to take place in the gardener's village; he was very eager to go and participate in the festivities. Hence, he decided to take at least one day off, but did not have the courage to face the landlord and ask for a day off. So, he thought all night, and came up with a plan.\n\nHe decided to approach a group of monkeys that were staying in a nearby forest. The gardener cautiously approached the leader of the monkeys and told him that he was a gardener, and worked in the big house, bordering the forest. He pointed out to the house and the leader of the monkeys, nodded in acknowledgement.\n\nThe gardener said that the house belonged to the landlord, and that he was a cruel and unkind man. He went on to add that the landlord did not give him a single day's rest.\n\nThe gardener then put forth his plight to the leader of the monkeys. He said, \"Tomorrow is a big festival in my village, and I wish to go and participate. Can you possibly help me?\"\n\nThe monkey chief was a bit taken aback, as he had no idea as to how help the poor gardener. He asked the gardener, \"In what way, can I or my subjects help you?\"\n\nThe gardener then laid down his plan. For one day, starting tomorrow, you and your subjects, please look after my work\". He further added that he would provide vessels and pots to all the monkeys, and all they had to do was to take it to the river, fill it, and subsequently water each plant. The monkey chief, after listening to the gardener's tale of woe, felt pity for him and said, \"Don't worry, you go and attend your festival, and we shall look after your work\".\n\nThe gardener was relieved and happy. He gave some vessels and pots to the monkeys and quickly left for his village to take part in the temple festival.\n\nHowever, the monkeys had one doubt. They had no idea as to how much water; they should pour on each plant, as they forgot to ask the gardener. So the approached the chief and told them about their problem.\n\nThe monkey chief thought for a while and said, \"You have to water each plant, according to the length of its root.\" His subjects then asked the leader on how they could find the length of the roots. The monkey chief, got a bit angry, dismissed them and said, \"Pull out each plant, find out how far the roots have gone in, and put them back and then water each plant accordingly.\"\n\nThe monkeys' were awestruck at their chief's wisdom and they all applauded. The chief, then proudly asked his subjects to get down to work without delay.\n\nThe monkeys' did as advised - they pulled each plant out, saw the length of the roots and planted them back haphazardly, and watered them. Because of this, most of the plants lost their roots in this process and started drying up.\n\nThe next day, the landlord came out for a stroll in his favorite garden, and noticed that all his plants had been uprooted, and that they were drying up. He immediately summoned for the gardener. The frightened gardener told the landlord what had happened, and this made the landlord very angry and he immediately dismissed the gardener from his job.\n\nAs a result of his foolish act, the gardener lost his job!"

      "body": "The Tale of the Magic Box:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a faraway land there lived a farmer with his two sons. He worked hard and looked after his farm, his cattle, and orchard regularly. He did not take a break and toiled with his laborers throughout the year. It was little wonder that he had fields finest in the village. His cattle and sheep were the best in the village. Choicest fruits and vegetables grew in his garden and orchard.\n\nDuring the monthly fair, where all village folks met to sell their wares, his was the best of the lot. His neighbors envied and said, \"There goes Manohar, his sons are fortunate to have him as a father. They are going to inherit all this when he dies\".\n\nManohar had two sons. The elder one was Ravi and the younger Hari. However, Manohar what could do with his farm, his land and his cattle, he could not do with his sons. They were not interested in following their father's footsteps. Ravi was a warrior and was more interested in arms and fighting, while Hari liked music and the fiddle.\n\nManohar secretly wished, \"I wish I had a son who loved farms more than arms and one who liked cattle better than fiddle\". He worried about what will happen to his lands, but decided he had to go with what he had, and hoped for the best.\n\nOne day, he asked his sons, \"What is it that you want to do in life?\"\n\nRavi was quick to reply, \"I want to join the army. I want to serve the country and make you proud\".\n\nHari seemed not so sure about what he wanted to do. \"Well, I like music, and I may become a musician, but think I will have to practice harder\".\n\nOkay\" the farmer said. \"Ravi, you go and join the army, and fulfill your wish\".\n\nThen he turned to Hari. \"You too can work towards your dream but meantime, help me with my work as well\".\n\nSo Ravi left and Hari stayed back with his father, occasionally helping him in his daily chores but mostly dreaming about his musical future.\n\nLife went on but one day Manohar fell ill and there was nothing that anybody could do to help him. On his deathbed, he called Hari and told him, \"Take good care of everything son, remember you are looking after your brothers share too, give it back to him intact, when he return from his duty\".\n\nThose were his last words, and Manohar died leaving everything he had in Hari's care.\n\nHari kept his father's words close to his heart, and started on his life as a farmer. Nevertheless, as time went on, he began falling back to his old, carefree ways. He thought, \"The lands have given good crops till now, the cattle and sheep has grown and prospered well, and trees have never stopped giving sweetest fruits, so why worry? There are laborers to look after them who have been doing this for long so they will continue to do so\". He began enjoying his newfound status as master and followed his wishes more vigorously.\n\nHowever, hoping for things to take care of themselves was too much to ask. Once left by themselves, laborers stopped giving their best, which meant crops weren't looked after, cattle was unattended, fruits ripened and fell down from the tree, but never reached markets on time. Thieves stole his cattle while pests and small birds made merry on the unmanned farms. The guards themselves turned to stealing as they found the opportunity too tempting.\n\nHari was oblivious to everything, lost in his world and music. The money his father left was getting him through the days and there was no shortage of friends and well-wishers while that lasted. But all things if not growing, have to come to an end. One night, it finally dawned upon Hari, when his father came to him in a dream.\n\n\"Remember my last words, son, remember to give your brother his share, or more if possible\" was all he said. Hari was relieved his father did not scold him for being careless, but once out of bed; he went to take stock of his brother's share. That soon turned to panic, as he learned about the real situation. The farm was nowhere near what it was, when his brother left, and he had nothing, no money or accounts to show him. He thought, \"What will he think? He may even send me to jail. And no one can blame him for that also\". Panic turning to fear, he approached his friends and well-wishers from the village. But they laughed him off, and said \"He hasn't come back till now, maybe he won't ever, why worry, enjoy\".\n\nBut Hari wasn't sure of that. He did not want his brother dead and he wanted him to come back. The thought of showing him the real situation made him panic, and he was running around in the village. His neighbours and others were having a good laugh at him, \"We warned you so many times. You did not look after your farm, and you always dismissed us, so now suffer!\" Nobody came forward to help him and they were all happy at his misery, and he couldn't blame them also for his own wrong doings.\n\nThere was one shepherd boy in the crowd, who was considered a simpleton by everybody. But only he gave something which seemed like a solution to Hari. The boy said, \"Master, why don't you go to the old lady on the mountains, who can do magic. Who knows she may bring your lost fortunes back through magic\".\n\nFor once, Hari took serious notice of the shepherd boy and climbed up the mountain. The old woman lived in a cave like house, too old to even move around, but her ears seem alright, she listened to his whole story. \"Please help me, old woman, bring my fortunes back, I will ever be grateful\" Hari pleaded.\n\nThe old woman took time to think, then went inside, and when she came back she had a small box in her hand, with a tiny hole on top. The box was locked and welded with brass strips. She handed the box to Hari and said, \"Everyday, before sunrise, shake one grain of magic dust on all corners of your land, and watch the magic happening\".\n\nHari's relief was beyond words. He took the magic box, thanked the old woman and quickly left for home. Next day he woke up, earlier than he had ever done and went with the box to the fields and started the routine as the lady said. But while doing it, he noticed the crops were half uncut in the fields. He also noticed the cut ones had not been taken inside or properly dried, and his laborers were sleeping comfortably.\n\nBeginning to get angry, Hari woke them up and sent them off to fields, with instructions to do their job properly. He repeated the same routine in the cattle sheds and orchards, Hari had to shout them off the beds, and chase them to start on their duties. Laborers were shocked and whispered to each other, \"The Master in the field? Now God saves us!\"\n\nThis routine was repeated every day. Hari went on shaking his magic dust in fields, and his laborers had to keep up with him. Every day, he found items that were left unattended and made sure it was taken care of. He was waiting for the magic to happen, but unknowingly he was making it happen. Within time, his farm, orchards and cattle began to prosper and seemed well on the way to the state when his father was alive.\n\nUnfortunately, his brother never came returned. He may have been killed in the war, but the good times came back for Hari. He got married to a good girl and had two sons. Time passed and while on his deathbed, he asked his sons to open the magic box he believed in so much which brought his good days back. The lock was opened and inside there was nothing except some sand and a note which said, \"The magic is in the master's eye and what your property needs is your attention\"."

      "body": "A Hole In The Fence:\n\nIn a small village, a little boy lived with his father and mother. He was the only son for them. The parents of the little boy were very depressed due to his bad temper. The boy used to get angry very soon and taunt others with his words. His bad temper made him fall for angry words. He scolded kids, neighbors and even his friends due to anger. He invited all worries for his parents through verbal usage. While he forgot what he spoke in anger, his friends and neighbors avoided him.\n\nHis mother and father consoled him in many ways to give up his anger and develop kindness. Unfortunately, all their attempts failed. Finally, the boy‘s father came up with an idea.\n\nOne day, his father gave him a huge bag of nails. He asked his son to hammer one nail to the fence every time he became angry and to lose his temper. The little boy found it hilarious and accepted to do what his father said.\n\nThe nails drove him to hammer in the fence for 30 times on the first day! Every time he lost his temper, he ran to the fence and hammered a nail. In the next few days, the number of nails hammered on the fence was reduced to half. The little boy found it very difficult to hammer the nails and decided to control his temper.\n\nGradually, the number of nails hammered to the fence was reduced and the day arrived when no nail was hammered! Yet, the boy did not lose his temper. He told his father that it was several days that he did not hammer any nail and he did not lose his temper!\n\nNow, his father told him to remove the nails every day as he had controlled his anger. Several days passed and the boy was able to pull out most of the nails from the fence. However, there remained a few nails that the boy could not pull out.\n\nThe boy told his father about the same. The father appreciated him and asked him pointing to the hole, ‘What do you see there?‘\n\nThe boy replied, ‘a hole in the fence!‘\n\nHe told the boy, “The nails were your bad temper and they were hammered on people. You can remove the nails but still see the holes in the fence. Again, you cannot pull out a few nails. The fence never looks the same! It has scars all over! You can stab a man with a knife, but the wound will remain there forever. Your bad temper and anger were like that! Words are more painful than physical abuse! Use words for good. Use them to embrace the relationships. Use them to show your heart! “\n\nInappropriate verbal usage would cause permanent marks than physical damage!\n\nLet our Words be kind and sweet."

      "body": "The Old Oak Tree's Last Dream:\n\nIn the woods, on a high bank near the open seashore, there stood such a very old oak tree. It was exactly three hundred and sixty-five years old, but this long span of years seemed to the tree scarcely longer than as many days do to people like us. A tree's life is not the same as a man's. We are awake during the day, and sleep at night, and we have our dreams.\n\nIt is different with a tree; it is awake throughout three seasons, and not until winter comes does it go to sleep. Winter is its time for sleeping; that is its night after the long day which we call spring, summer, and autumn.\n\nMany a warm summer day the May flies danced around its crown, lived happily and felt fortunate as they flitted about; and if one of the tiny creatures rested from its blissful play for a moment on a large oak leaf, the tree always said, \"Poor little insect! Your whole life is but one day long! How sad!\"\n\n\"Sad?\" the little May fly always answered. \"What do you mean by that? Everything is so bright and warm and beautiful, and I am so happy!\"\n\n\"But only for one day, and then all is over.\"\n\n\"Over?\" said the May fly. \"What does over mean? Is it also over for you?\"\n\n\"No, I shall live perhaps thousands of your days, and a day for me lasts a whole year. That is something so long you can't even figure it out.\"\n\n\"No, I don't understand you at all. You have thousands of my days to live, but I have thousands of moments in which to be happy and joyous. Will all the beauty of this world die when you die?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the tree. \"It will probably last longer, infinitely longer, than I am able to imagine.\"\n\n\"Well, then, we each have an equally long lifetime, only we figure differently.\"\n\nAnd so the May fly danced and glided in the air, with its fine, artistic wings of veil and velvet, rejoicing in the warm air that was so perfumed with delicious scents from the clover field and the wild roses, elders, and honeysuckles of the hedges, not ot speak of the bluebells, cowslip, and wild thyme; the fragrance was so strong that the tiny insect felt a little intoxicated from it. The day was long and beautiful, full of happiness and sweet experiences, and by sunset the little May fly was pleasantly weary from all the excitement. Its dainty wings would no longer support it; very gently it glided down onto the cool, rocking blades of grass, nodded its head as a May fly can, and fell into a very peaceful slumber; it was dead.\n\n\"Poor little May fly,\" said the Oak; \"that was really too short a life!\"\n\nAnd every summer day was repeated the same dance, the same question, the same answer, and the same peaceful falling asleep; it happened through many generations of May flies, and all of them were lighthearted and happy.\n\nThe Oak stood wide-awake through its spring morning, its summer noon, and autumn evening; soon now it would be sleeping time, the tree's night, for winter was coming. Already the winds were singing, \"Good night! Good night! There falls a leaf; there falls a leaf! We plucked it, we plucked it! See that you go to sleep! We will sing you to sleep, we will rock you to sleep! Surely it will do your old limbs good. They crackle from pure contentment. Sleep sweetly, sleeep sweetly! This is your three hundred and sixty-fifth night, but you are really only a yearling! Sleep sweetly! The skies are sprinkling snow; it will spread a warm coverlet over your feet. Sleep sweetly and have pleasant dreams!\"\n\nAnd now the great Oak stood stripped of its foliage, ready to rest throughout the long winter, and in its sleep to dream of something that had happened to it, just as men dream.\n\nThe tree had once been very small; yes, an acorn had been its cradle. According to human calculation, it was now in its fourth century; it was the tallest and mightiest tree in the forest; its crown towered high above all the other trees and could be seen far out at sea, where it served as a landmark to ships. The Oak had never thought of how many eyes sought it out from the watery distance. High up in its green crown the wood doves had built their nests, and there the cuckoo made its voice heard; and in the autumn, when its leaves looked like hammered-out copper plates, the birds of passage rested awhile there before flying on across the seas. But now it was winter; the tree was leafless, and the bowed and gnarled branches showed their dark outlines; crows and jackdaws came to gossip about the hard times that were beginning and how difficult it was to find food in the winter.\n\nIt was just at the holy Christmastime that the Oak dreamed its most beautiful dream-and this we shall hear.\n\nThe tree had a distinct feeling that it was a holiday season. It seemed to hear all the church bells ringing round about, and at that the day was mild and warm, like a lovely summer day. The Oak spread its mighty crown; sunbeams flickered among the leaves and branches, and the air was filled with the fragrance of herbs and blossoms. Colored butterflies played tag, and the May flies danced, which was the only way they could show their happiness. All that the tree had encountered and witnessed through the many years passed by as if in a holiday procession.\n\nKnights and ladies of bygone days, with feathers in their caps and hawks on their wrists, rode gaily through the forest; dogs barked and the hunting horn sounded. The tree saw hostile soldiers, in shining armor and gaily colored garments, with spears and halberds, pitching their tents and then striking them again; the watchfire blazed, and they sang and then slept under the tree's protecting boughs. It saw lovers meet in quiet happiness there in the moonlight, and carve their names, or their initials, on the gray-green bark. At one time, many years before, a guitar and an Aeolian harp had been hung up in the Oak's boughs by carefree traveling youths; now they hung there again, and now once more their lovely music sounded. The wood doves cooed, as if they were trying to express what the tree felt, and the cuckoo announced many more summer days it had to live.\n\nThen it seemed that a new and stronger current of life flowed through the Oak, down into its smallest roots, up into its highest twigs, even out into the leaves! The tree felt that it was stretching; it could feel how life and warmth stirred down in the earth about its roots; it felt the strength increase and that it was growing taller and taller. The trunk shot up; there was no rest for the tree; it grew more and more; its crown became fuller; it spread and towered. And as the tree grew, its strength grew also, as did its ardent yearning to reach higher and higher toward the bright, warm sun.\n\nAlready it was high above the clouds, which drifted far below it, like a troop of dark migratory birds or like flocks of white swans.\n\nAnd every leaf of the tree could see as if it had eyes; the stars became visible to them by daylight, large and bright, all shining, like very clear, mild eyes. They reminded the Oak of dear, kindly eyes it had known, the eyes of children, the eyes of lovers, who had met beneath the tree.\n\nIt was a blessed moment, so full of joy! And yet in all its joy the Oak felt a longing, a great desire that all the other trees below, all the bushes, plants, and flowers of the forest, might be lifted up with it, to share in its glory and gladness. Amid all its dream of splendor, the mighty Oak could not be fully happy without all the others, small and great, sharing in it, and this yearning thrilled through boughs and leaves as fervently, as strongly, as it would within a human heart.\n\nThe crown of the tree bowed and looked back, as if it sought someting it had missed. Then it felt the thyme and soon the still stronger scent of honeysuckle and violet, and imagined it could hear the cuckoo talking to itself.\n\nYes, and now the green tops of the forest peeped up through the clouds. The Oak saw that the other trees below were growing and lifting themselves up as it had; bushes and plants rose high into the air, some even tearing themselves loose from their roots, to soar up all the faster. The birch grew the most rapidly; like a white flash of lightning its slender stem shot up, its boughs waving like green gauze and banners. The whole forest, even the feathery brown reeds, grew high into the sky; the birds followed and sang, and on the grass that waved to and fro like long, green silken ribbons, the grasshopper sat, and drummed with his wings against his lean legs. The cockchafers hummed and the bees buzzed and every bird sang to the best of its ability; song and happiness were everywhere, right up into heaven.\n\n\"But the little red flower by the water-that should come along!\" said the Oak tree. \"And the bluebell flower, and the little daisy!\" Yes, the Oak wanted to have them all with it.\n\n\"We are here! We are with you!\" they sang and rang out.\n\n\"But the pretty anemones of last summer-and the mass of lilies of the valley of the year before that-and the wild crabapple tree that bloomed so beautifully-and all the beauties of the forest, throughout the many years-if only they had lived on and remained till now, then they also could have been with us!\"\n\n\"We are here! We are with you!\" they sang and rang out, even higher up; it seemed that they had ascended before the others.\n\n\"No, this is too wonderful to be true!\" rejoiced the Oak. \"I have them all with me; small and great, not one is forgotten! How can all this blessedness be conceivable and possible?\"\n\n\"In the kingdom of God all things are conceivable and possible,\" came the mighty answer.\n\nAnd the tree, which continued to grow, felt its very roots loosening themselves from the earth. \"This is the best of all,\" it said. \"Now no bonds shall hold me; I can soar upward to the heights of glory and light! And my loved ones are all with me, small and great-all with me!\"\n\n\"All!\"\n\nThat was the dream of the Oak tree, and while it dreamed on that holy Christmas Eve, a mighty storm was sweeping over land and sea. The ocean piled its heavy billows onto the shore; the tree cracked, groaned, and was torn up by the roots, at the very moment when it was dreaming that its roots were freeing themselves from the earth. It fell. Its three hundred and sixty-five years were now as a day is to the May fly.\n\nChristmas morning, when the sun rose, the storm was past. All the church bells rang, while from every chimney, even the smallest one, on the peasant's hut, the blue smoke curled upward, like sacrificial steam rising from the altars of the ancient Druids. The sea became more and more calm, and aboard a big vessel that had weathered the storm of the night before all flags were hoisted now in greeting to the Yuletide. \"The tree is gone-the old oak tree that was our landmark!\" said the sailors. \"It must have fallen during the storm last night. What can ever replace it? Nothing!\"\n\nThat was the tree's eulogy, brief but sincere. There it lay, stretched out on the carpet of snow near the shore, while over it sounded the hymn sung on the ship, sung in thanksgiving for the joy of Christmas, for the bliss of the human soul's salvation through Christ, for the gift of eternal life:\n\nSing loud, sweet angel, on Christmas morn.\nHallelujah! Christ the Saviour is born.\nIn joy receive His blessing.\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!\nThus sounded the old hymn, and everyone aboard the ship felt himself lifted heavenward by the hymn, and by prayer, even as the old tree had lifted itself in its last, most beautiful dream that Christmas Eve."

      "body": "Fairy Tales - Repentance:\n\nBLONDINE was stupefied! Her conduct now appeared to her in all its horror. She had shown a monstrous ingratitude towards the friends who had been so tenderly devoted to her who had dedicated seven years to the care of her education. Would these kind friends ever receive her, ever pardon her? What would be her fate, if they should close their doors against her? And then, what did those awful words of the wicked Parrot signify: “You have caused the destruction of your friends “?\n\nBlondine turned round and wished to retrace her steps to the castle of Bonne-Biche. The briers and thorns tore her arms and face terribly. She continued, however, to force her way bravely through the thickets and after three hours of most painful walking she came before the castle of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon.\n\nHorror seized upon her when in place of the superb building she saw only an appalling ruin in place of the magnificent trees and rare flowers that surrounded it, only briers and thorns, nettles and thistles, could be seen. Terrified and most desolate, she tried to force her way in the midst of the ruins, to seek some knowledge of her kind friends. A large Toad issued from a pile of stones, advanced before her, and said :\n\n“What are you seeking? Have you not occasioned the death of your friends by the basest ingratitude? Begone! do not insult their memory by your unwelcome presence! “\n\n“Alas! alas! “ cried Blondine, “my poor friends, Bonne- Biche and Beau-Mir on, why can I not atone by my death for the sufferings I have caused them? “ And she fell, sobbing piteously, upon the stones and nettles; her grief and her repentance were so excessive that she did not feel their sharp points in her tender flesh. She wept profusely a long time. At last, she arose and looked about her, hoping to find some shelter where she might take refuge. Ruin only stared her in the face!\n\n“Well, “ said she, “let the wild beasts tear me to pieces, let me die of hunger and thirst, if I can expiate my sins here upon the tomb of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon! “\n\nAs she uttered these words, she heard a soft voice saying: “True repentance can atone for the worst of crimes. “\n\nShe raised her head and saw only an immense black Crow flying above her.\n\n“Alas! alas! “ said Blondine, “my repentance however true, however bitter it may be, can never give me back the lives of my dear Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon ! “\n\n“Courage, courage, Blondine! redeem your fault by your repentance and do not allow yourself to be utterly cast down by grief. “\n\nThe poor princess arose and left the scene of desolation. She followed a little path, where the large trees seemed to have rooted out the brambles and the earth was covered with moss. She was utterly exhausted with grief and fatigue and fell at the foot of a large tree, sobbing piteously.\n\n“Courage, Blondine ! “ said another voice; “courage and hope! “\n\nShe saw near her only a Frog, which was looking at her compassionately.\n\n“Oh, Frog! “ said the princess, “you seem to pity my anguish! What will become of me now that I am alone and desolate in the world? “\n\n“Courage and hope ! “ was the reply.\n\nBlondine sighed deeply and looked around, hoping to discover some herb or fruit to appease her hunger and thirst. She saw nothing and her tears flowed freely. The sound of bells now somewhat dissipated her despairing thoughts. She saw a beautiful cow approaching her, gently and slowly. On arriving near her, the cow paused, bowed down, and showed her a silver porringer attached to her neck by a chain of beaten gold.\n\nBlondine was very grateful for this unexpected succor. She detached the porringer, milked the cow and drank the sweet milk with delight. The pretty, gentle cow signed to her to replace the porringer. Blondine obeyed, kissed her on the neck and said, sadly :\n\n“Thanks, Blanchette, it is without a doubt to my poor friends that I owe this sweet charity. Perhaps in another and better world they can see the repentance of their poor Blondine and wish to assist her in her frightful position. “\n\n“A true repentance will obtain pardon for all faults, “ said a kind voice.\n\n“Ah! “ exclaimed Blondine, “years of sorrow and weeping for my crimes would not suffice! I can never pardon myself! “\n\nIn the meantime, night approached. Notwithstanding her anguish and repentance, Blondine began to reflect upon some means of securing herself from the ferocious wild beasts, whose terrible roars she already believed she heard in the distance. She saw some steps before her a kind of hut, formed by several trees growing near together and interlacing their branches. Bowing her head, she entered and found that by carefully connecting some branches she could form a pretty and secure retreat. She employed the remainder of the day in arranging this little room and gathered a quantity of moss, with which she made herself a bed and pillow. She concealed the entrance to this little retreat by some broken branches and leaves and went to rest, utterly worn out with regret and fatigue.\n\nWhen Blondine awoke it was broad daylight. At first, she could scarcely collect her thoughts and understand her position but the sad realities of her lot were soon apparent to her and she commenced weeping as before.\n\nBlondine was hungry, and she could not imagine how she was going to secure food but soon she heard again the sound of the cow-bells. In a few moments, Blanchette stood near her. Blondine again loosened the porringer, drew the milk and drank till her hunger was appeased, then replaced the porringer and kissed Blanchette, hoping to see her again during the day. Every day in the morning, at midday and in the evening Blanchette came to offer Blondine her frugal repast.\n\nBlondine passed the time in tears for her poor friends, and bitter self-reproach for her crimes.\n\n“By my unpardonable disobedience, “ she said to herself, “I have caused the most terrible misfortunes, which it is not in my power to repair. I have not only lost my good and true friends but I am deprived of the only means of finding my father, my poor father, who perhaps still expects his Blondine, his most unhappy Blondine, condemned to live and die alone in this frightful forest where her evil genius reigns supreme. “\n\nBlondine sought to amuse and employ herself in every possible way. Her little home was neatly arranged, and fresh moss and leaves composed her simple couch. She had tied some branches together and formed a seat and she made herself some needles and pins of the thorns and twisted some thread from the hemp which grew near her little hut, and with these implements, she had mended the rents in her shoes.\n\nIn this simple way, Blondine lived for six months; her grief was always the same and it is just to say that it was not her sad and solitary life which made her unhappy but sincere regret for her fault. She would willingly have consented to pass her life in the forest if she could thus have brought to life Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon."

Just because of their similarity in physical appearance, the girls were admitted in different schools.\n\nAlthough they look identical, both the girls differ in everything else. They don’t have many common favorites. Spicy food was Lara’s favorite and Tara was having a sweet choice of food. Lara was a night-bird and studied all night until she finished. On the contrary, Tara was a morning bird; she used to wake up early in the morning. In addition, Lara wore light darker shades and modern outfits, where Tara likes pastel shades and traditional dresses.\n\nThis wasn’t the problem with these twin girls. However, they fought each other and the opposite one was wrong. For example, Lara will fight; waking up in the early morning is a terrible thing. You may not get enough time for study and homework. If you complete it at night, you can sleep peacefully!’\n\nTara always argued, ‘Mornings are fresh. It is difficult to stay up at midnight when you really feel sleepy!’\n\nWhile both sides have advantages and disadvantages, the argument continues. They fight mainly about simple things all-day and during study time. Their parents decided to put an end to their arguments and created a small drama to let them understand that they both were correct from their point of view.\n\nLara and Tara blindfolded their eyes with a black ribbon. Their parents brought them to the dining room.\n\nIn the dining room, a big board was placed in the middle. Lara stood on one side of the board and Tara stood on the other side of the board. They were not able to see the other side of the board. Both the ribbons were removed.

She replied, ‘It is black!’\n\nTheir mother asked Tara the same question. She replied, ‘It is white!’\n\nThey began to argue. While Lara insisted strongly it was black, Tara was confident it was white.\n\nNow, they were asked to exchange their places.\n\nLara took Tara’s place and Tara took Lara’s place.\n\nThey both were surprised and shocked.\n\nThe board with Lara’s side was painted black and Tara’s was white, which was assured by them.\n\nYes, both of them were right.\n\nTara, who insisted it was a whiteboard, saw the black one on the other side. Similarly, Lara, who argued the board was black, was shocked to see the whiteboard.\n\nThey understood that they were right from their own perspective.\n\nMost of us are like Lara and Tara.

      "body": "The Red Shoes:\n\nThere was once a little girl, very nice and very pretty, but so poor that she had to go barefooted all summer. And in winter she had to wear thick wooden shoes that chafed her ankles until they were red, oh, as red as could be.\n\nIn the middle of the village lived \"Old Mother Shoemaker.\" She took some old scraps of red cloth and did her best to make them into a little pair of shoes. They were a bit clumsy, but well meant, for she intended to give them to the little girl. Karen was the little girl's name.\n\nThe first time Karen wore her new red shoes was on the very day when her mother was buried. Of course, they were not right for mourning, but they were all she had, so she put them on and walked barelegged after the plain wicker coffin.\n\nJust then a large old carriage came by, with a large old lady inside it. She looked at the little girl and took pity upon her. And she went to the parson and said: \"Give the little girl to me, and I shall take good care of her.\"\n\nKaren was sure that this happened because she wore red shoes, but the old lady said the shoes were hideous, and ordered them burned. Karen was given proper new clothes. She was taught to read, and she was taught to sew. People said she was pretty, but her mirror told her, \"You are more than pretty. You are beautiful.\"\n\nIt happened that the Queen came traveling through the country with her little daughter, who was a Princess. Karen went with all the people who flocked to see them at the castle. The little Princess, all dressed in white, came to the window to let them admire her. She didn't wear a train, and she didn't wear a gold crown, but she did wear a pair of splendid red morocco shoes. Of course, they were much nicer than the ones \"Old Mother Shoemaker\" had put together for little Karen, but there's nothing in the world like a pair of red shoes!\n\nWhen Karen was old enough to be confirmed, new clothes were made for her, and she was to have new shoes. They went to the house of a thriving shoemaker, to have him take the measure of her little feet. In his shop were big glass cases, filled with the prettiest shoes and the shiniest boots. They looked most attractive but, as the old lady did not see very well, they did not attract her. Among the shoes there was a pair of red leather ones which were just like those the Princess had worn. How perfect they were! The shoemaker said he had made them for the daughter of a count, but that they did not quite fit her.\n\n\"They must be patent leather to shine so,\" said the old lady.\n\n\"Yes, indeed they shine,\" said Karen. As the shoes fitted Karen, the old lady bought them, but she had no idea they were red. If she had known that, she would never have let Karen wear them to confirmation, which is just what Karen did.\n\nEvery eye was turned toward her feet. When she walked up the aisle to the chancel of the church, it seemed to her as if even those portraits of bygone ministers and their wives, in starched ruffs and long black gowns-even they fixed their eyes upon her red shoes. She could think of nothing else, even when the pastor laid his hands upon her head and spoke of her holy baptism, and her covenant with God, and her duty as a Christian. The solemn organ rolled, the children sang sweetly, and the old choir leader sang too, but Karen thought of nothing except her red shoes.\n\nBefore the afternoon was over, the old lady had heard from everyone in the parish that the shoes were red. She told Karen it was naughty to wear red shoes to church. Highly improper! In the future she was always to wear black shoes to church, even though they were her old ones.\n\nNext Sunday there was holy communion. Karen looked at her black shoes. She looked at her red ones. She kept looking at her red ones until she put them on.\n\nIt was a fair, sunny day. Karen and the old lady took the path through the cornfield, where it was rather dusty. At the church door they met an old soldier, who stood with a crutch and wore a long, curious beard. It was more reddish than white. In fact it was quite red. He bowed down to the ground, and asked the old lady if he might dust her shoes. Karen put out her little foot too.\n\n\"Oh, what beautiful shoes for dancing,\" the soldier said. \"Never come off when you dance,\" he told the shoes, as he tapped the sole of each of them with his hand.\n\nThe old lady gave the soldier a penny, and went on into the church with Karen. All the people there stared at Karen's red shoes, and all the portraits stared too. When Karen knelt at the altar rail, and even when the chalice came to her lips, she could think only of her red shoes. It was as if they kept floating around in the chalice, and she forgot to sing the psalm. She forgot to say the Lord's Prayer.\n\nThen church was over, and the old lady got into her carriage. Karen was lifting her foot to step in after her when the old soldier said, \"Oh, what beautiful shoes for dancing!\"\n\nKaren couldn't resist taking a few dancing steps, and once she began her feet kept on dancing. It was as if the shoes controlled her. She danced round the corner of the church-she simply could not help it. The coachman had to run after her, catch her, and lift her into the carriage. But even there her feet went on dancing so that she gave the good old lady a terrible kicking. Only when she took her shoes off did her legs quiet down. When they got home the shoes were put away in a cupboard, but Karen would still go and look at them.\n\nShortly afterwards the old lady was taken ill, and it was said she could not recover. She required constant care and faithful nursing, and for this she depended on Karen. But a great ball was being given in the town, and Karen was invited. She looked at the old lady, who could not live in any case. She looked at the red shoes, for she thought there was no harm in looking. She put them on, for she thought there was no harm in that either. But then she went to the ball and began dancing. When she tried to turn to the right, the shoes turned to the left. When she wanted to dance up the ballroom, her shoes danced down. They danced down the stairs, into the street, and out through the gate of the town. Dance she did, and dance she must, straight into the dark woods.\n\nSuddenly something shone through the trees, and she thought it was the moon, but it turned out to be the red-bearded soldier. He nodded and said, \"Oh, what beautiful shoes for dancing.\"\n\nShe was terribly frightened, and tried to take off her shoes. She tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to her feet. And dance she did, for dance she must, over fields and valleys, in the rain and in the sun, by day and night. It was most dreadful by night. She danced over an unfenced graveyard, but the dead did not join her dance. They had better things to do. She tried to sit on a pauper's grave, where the bitter fennel grew, but there was no rest or peace for her there. And when she danced toward the open doors of the church, she saw it guarded by an angel with long white robes and wings that reached from his shoulders down to the ground. His face was grave and stern, and in his hand he held a broad, shining sword.\n\n\"Dance you shall!\" he told her. \"Dance in your red shoes until you are pale and cold, and your flesh shrivels down to the skeleton. Dance you shall from door to door, and wherever there are children proud and vain you must knock at the door till they hear you, and are afraid of you. Dance you shall. Dance always.\"\n\n\"Have mercy upon me!\" screamed Karen. But she did not hear the angel answer. Her shoes swept her out through the gate, and across the fields, along highways and byways, forever and always dancing.\n\nOne morning she danced by a door she knew well. There was the sound of a hymn, and a coffin was carried out covered with flowers. Then she knew the old lady was dead. She was all alone in the world now, and cursed by the angel of God.\n\nDance she did and dance she must, through the dark night. Her shoes took her through thorn and briar that scratched her until she bled. She danced across the wastelands until she came to a lonely little house. She knew that this was where the executioner lived, and she tapped with her finger on his window pane.\n\n\"Come out!\" she called. \"Come out! I can't come in, for I am dancing.\"\n\nThe executioner said, \"You don't seem to know who I am. I strike off the heads of bad people, and I feel my ax beginning to quiver.\"\n\n\"Don't strike off my head, for then I could not repent of my sins,\" said Karen. \"But strike off my feet with the red shoes on them.\"\n\nShe confessed her sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes on them. The shoes danced away with her little feet, over the fields into the deep forest. But he made wooden feet and a pair of crutches for her. He taught her a hymn that prisoners sing when they are sorry for what they have done. She kissed his hand that held the ax, and went back across the wasteland.\n\n\"Now I have suffered enough for those red shoes,\" she said. \"I shall go and be seen again in the church.\" She hobbled to church as fast as she could, but when she got there the red shoes danced in front of her, and she was frightened and turned back.\n\nAll week long she was sorry, and cried many bitter tears. But when Sunday came again she said, \"Now I have suffered and cried enough. I think I must be as good as many who sit in church and hold their heads high.\" She started out unafraid, but the moment she came to the church gate she saw her red shoes dancing before her. More frightened than ever, she turned away, and with all her heart she really repented.\n\nShe went to the pastor's house, and begged him to give her work as a servant. She promised to work hard, and do all that she could. Wages did not matter, if only she could have a roof over her head and be with good people. The pastor's wife took pity on her, and gave her work at the parsonage. Karen was faithful and serious. She sat quietly in the evening, and listened to every word when the pastor read the Bible aloud. The children were devoted to her, but when they spoke of frills and furbelows, and of being as beautiful as a queen, she would shake her head.\n\nWhen they went to church next Sunday they asked her to go too, but with tears in her eyes she looked at her crutches, and shook her head. The others went to hear the word of God, but she went to her lonely little room, which was just big enough to hold her bed and one chair. She sat with her hymnal in her hands, and as she read it with a contrite heart she heard the organ roll. The wind carried the sound from the church to her window. Her face was wet with tears as she lifted it up, and said, \"Help me, O Lord!\"\n\nThen the sun shone bright, and the white-robed angel stood before her. He was the same angel she had seen that night, at the door of the church. But he no longer held a sharp sword. In his hand was a green branch, covered with roses. He touched the ceiling with it. There was a golden star where it touched, and the ceiling rose high. He touched the walls and they opened wide. She saw the deep-toned organ. She saw the portraits of ministers and their wives. She saw the congregation sit in flower-decked pews, and sing from their hymnals. Either the church had come to the poor girl in her narrow little room, or it was she who had been brought to the church. She sat in the pew with the pastor's family. When they had finished the hymn, they looked up and nodded to her.\n\n\"It was right for you to come, little Karen,\" they said.\n\n\"It was God's own mercy,\" she told them.\n\nThe organ sounded and the children in the choir sang, softly and beautifully. Clear sunlight streamed warm through the window, right down to the pew where Karen sat. She was so filled with the light of it, and with joy and with peace, that her heart broke. Her soul traveled along the shaft of sunlight to heaven, where no one questioned her about the red shoes."

Her father had passed away when she was still young. So her mom and she had to work very hard to make ends meet.\n\nOne day, the mother fell ill. She told her daughter, “My dear daughter, call a doctor for me!” The little girl quickly left home with worries filling up her heart. Suddenly, she came across a snowy-haired old man. He asked her, “Why are you so much in hurry?” “I am looking for a doctor. My mother is very sick!” she cried.\n\nThe old man then told her, “I am a doctor! Take me to your home, I will cure your mother.” When the old man arrived, after examining the mother, he told the girl, “Your mother’s sickness is serious. I will try my best to cure her. Now, get to banyan tree by the woods. You’ll find a daisy. Pick it up and bring it back to me!”\n\nIt was bitterly cold outside, while the girl was only wearing a thin layer of clothes. She kept on walking and it was not until her feet felt worn that she reached the banyan tree. In front of her was a bush with a beautiful daisy. She picked it up and cherished it in her hands.\n\nAll of a sudden, the old man’s voice echoed in her ears, “Each petal represents a day your mother continues to live.” She looked down on the flower and counted, “One, Two, Three… Twenty! Oh, no! There are only twenty days left for my mother!”\n\nThinking for a while, she gently tore the petals into many small pieces. Each piece turned into a thin glossy petal. The twenty-petal daisy turned into a countless-petal flower. She rushed home with the strange flower. The old man was waiting for her at the door. He told her cheerfully, “Your mother has recovered. It is the reward for your pious heart.”\n\nEver since then, every year during the autumn, the flowers with many thin glossy petals blossom created a picturesque scenery. They are called the Chrysanthemum, the symbol of piety."

      "body": "The Silver Shilling:\n\nThere was once a shilling; it came out bright and shiny from the mint, and sprang up, shouting, \"Hurrah! Now I'm going out into the wide world!\" And into the wide world he went. The child held it with soft, tender hands; the miser clutched it with cold, clammy fingers; the old man turned it over many times before letting it go; while the youth immediately passed it along. The Shilling was of silver, with very little copper in it; already it had been in the world for a whole year now-that is, in the country where it was made. But one day it started to travel to foreign lands; it was the last native coin in the purse that the traveling gentleman had with him. He himself didn't know he had this coin until it happened to come between his fingers.\n\n\"Why, here's a shilling from home I still have,\" he said. \"It can make the trip with me.\"\n\nAnd the Shilling rattled and jumped for joy as it was put back into the purse. So here it lay among foreign companions, who came and went, each making a place for the next one. Only the Shilling from home always stayed in the purse, which was a mark of distinction.\n\nSeveral weeks passed, and the Shilling was far out in the world, without knowing exactly where it was, although it did hear that the other coins were French or Italian. One said they were in a certain town, another reported that they had reached another place, but the Shilling hadn't any idea about it. Anyone who keeps his head in a bag can't see a thing; and that was the case with the Shilling.\n\nBut as it lay there one day it noticed that the purse was not completely shut, so it sneaked forward to the opening to take a peek. It shouldn't have done that, but it was full of curiosity, and people often have to pay for that. It slipped out into the trouser pocket, and when the purse was taken out that night the Shilling remained behind and was taken with the clothes to the hall closet. There it dropped on the floor; no one heard it, and no one saw it.\n\nNext morning the clothes were returned to the room; the gentleman put them on, and started on his journey again, but the Shilling was left behind. It was found, required to do service again, and was sent out with three other coins.\n\n\"It's an interesting thing to look about you in the world,\" thought the Shilling, \"and to get to know different people and customs.\"\n\n\"What kind of coin is that?\" said someone at that very moment. \"That's not a genuine coin! It's a fake! It's no good!\"\n\nYes, now began the real history of the Shilling, as told by itself.\n\n\" 'False! No good!' Those words really hurt me,\" said the Shilling. \"I knew I was made of good silver, had a good ring and a genuine stamp on me. People were certainly mistaken; they couldn't mean me! But they did mean me; I was the one they called false and no good! 'I must get rid of that fellow in the dark!' said the man I belonged to. So I was passed on at night, and then again chided in broad daylight. 'False-no good! We must hurry up and get rid of it!' \"\n\nAnd the Shilling trembled in its master's fingers each time it was to be passed on as a native coin.\n\n\"What a wretched shilling I am! What good is my silver to me, or my value, or my stamp, if all these things are considered worthless? The world gives you only such value as it chooses. It must be really dreadful to have a bad conscience, and to sneak about in the path of evil, if I, who am quite innocent, can feel so wretched just because I have my looks against me!\n\n\"Each time they brought me out I shuddered at the thought of the eyes that would glare at me, because I knew I would be rejected and flung back on the counter like a liar and a fraud.\n\n\"One time I came into the hands of a poor old woman, who received me as wages for a hard day's toil and labor, and she couldn't get rid of me at all. Nobody would accept me, and I was a real worry to the old woman.\n\n\" 'I shall certainly have to fool somebody with this shilling,' she said, 'for I can't afford to keep a false shilling. I'll pass him on to the rich baker; he'll be able to stand the loss better than I can; but still it is an injustice I will be doing.'\n\n\"What a weight I must be on that woman's conscience, too,\" sighed the Shilling. \"Am I really changed so much in my old age? And the woman went to the rich baker, but he knew the current shillings too well to accept me; I was thrown back in the woman's face, and she got no bread for me. And I felt grieved that I should be the cause of trouble to others-I, who in my young days had been so proud of my value and the soundness of my coinage. I was as melancholy as a poor shilling can be whom no one will accept; but the woman took me home, looked at me earnestly, with kindly, friendly eyes, and said, 'No, I won't deceive anyone with you. I'll bore a hole through you, so everyone can see you're false. And yet-a thought just occurs to me-perhaps you are a lucky shilling; yes, I believe you are; I have such a strong feeling about it! I'll make a hole through the coin, pass a string through it, and then give it to the neighbor's little child to hang around her neck as a good-luck shilling.'\n\n\"And she drilled a hole right through me. It certainly isn't very pleasant to have a hole bored through you, but you can stand many things when you know the intentions are good. A thread was passed through the hole, and I was hung around the child's neck like a kind of medal. The child smiled at me and kissed me, and all that night I slept on its warm, innocent breast.\n\n\"Next morning the child's mother took me up and looked at me and had another idea about me-I could feel that immediately. She brought out a pair of scissors and cut the string.\n\n\" 'A lucky shilling!' she cried. 'Well, we'll see about that!'\n\n\"Then she soaked me in vinegar, until I turned quite green, puttied up the hole, rubbed me a little, and that evening took me to the lottery collector, to buy a lottery ticket that would make her fortune.\n\n'How utterly unhappy I felt! There was a stinging inside me as if I were going to break in half. I knew that I should be called false and thrown away, and before a crowd of other coins, too, who lay there proud of their inscriptions and faces. But I escaped that time, for there were many people in the collector's office-he was very busy, so I rattled into the box with the other coins. I don't know if my ticket won anything or not, but I do know that the very next morning I was recognized as a bad coin and sent out to deceive again and again. That is a very trying thing to endure when you have a good character, and this I cannot deny that I have.\n\n\"For years and days I wandered this way from house to house, from hand to hand, always rebuked, always unwelcome; nobody believed me, and finally I lost confidence in the world and myself; those were hard times. One day a traveler arrived, and naturally I was passed on to him, and he was courteous enough to accept me as good. But when he tried to pass me on again, I heard once more the cry, 'That coin's no good! It's false!' \"\n\n\" 'I accepted it as genuine,' said the man, and looked closely at me. Then he smiled all over his face; never before had a face looked like that after a close examination of me. 'Why, what's this?' he said. 'That's a coin from my own country, a good honest shilling from home, that someone has bored a hole through and called false. Now, that's a strange coincidence. I'll just keep it and take it home with me.'\n\n\"A thrilling glow of joy shot through me when I heard him call me a honest shilling; now I would go home, where each and everyone would know me and realize that I was of good silver and bore a genuine stamp. I felt like throwing out sparks of happiness, but after all it isn't my nature to throw out sparks; that's something for steel to do, not silver.\n\n\"I was wrapped up in a clean white piece of paper, so that I wouldn't be mixed up with the other coins and be lost; and only on special occasions when people from my own country got together was I shown around, and they said nice things about me. They thought I was interesting-and it's surprising how interesting you can be without saying a single word.\n\n\"So at last I was home again. All my troubles were over, and I was happy again, for I was made of good silver and had the genuine stamp. I had no more misery to endure, even though a hole had been bored through me as if I were false; that doesn't matter if you're not really false. Just wait for the end, and everything will come out all right. That is my firm belief,\" said the Shilling."

      "body": "Fairy Tales - Blondine Second Awakening:\nBLONDINE slept profoundly, and on awaking, she found herself entirely changed. Indeed, it seemed to her she could not be the same person. She was much taller, her intellect was developed, her knowledge enlarged. She remembered a number of books she thought she had read during her sleep. She was sure she had been writing, drawing, singing and playing on the piano and harp.\n\nShe looked around, however, and knew that the chamber was the same to which Bonne-Biche had conducted her and in which she had gone to sleep.\n\nAgitated, disquieted, she rose and ran to the glass. She saw that she was much grown and she found herself charming, a hundred times more beautiful than when she retired the night before. Her fair ringlets fell to her feet, her complexion was like the lily and the rose, her eyes celestial blue, her nose beautifully formed, her cheeks rosy as the morn, and her form was erect and graceful. In short, Blondine thought herself the most beautiful person she had ever seen.\n\nTrembling, almost frightened, she dressed hastily and ran to seek Bonne-Biche whom she found in the apartment where she had first seen her.\n\n“Bonne-Biche, Bonne-Biche! “ she exclaimed, “I entreat you to explain to me the change which I see and feel in myself. Last night I went to sleep a child I awoke this morning and found myself a young lady. Is this an illusion or have I indeed grown and developed thus during the night? “\n\n“Yes, my dear Blondine, you are fourteen years old today. But you have slept peacefully for seven years. My son Beau-Minon and I wished to spare you the weariness of all early studies. When you first entered the castle you knew nothing; not even how to read. I put you to sleep for seven years, and Beau-Minon and I have passed this time instructing you during your sleep. I see by the wonder expressed in your eyes, sweet princess, that you doubt all this. Come into your study and reassure yourself on this point. “\n\nBlondine followed Bonne-Biche to the little room. She ran first to the piano, commenced playing and found that she played remarkably well. She then tried the harp and drew from it the most ravishing sounds, and she sang enchantingly.\n\nShe took her pencil and brushes and drew and painted with a facility which denoted a true talent. She wrote and found her handwriting clear and elegant. She looked at the countless books which ranged around the room and knew that she had read them all.\n\nSurprised, delighted, she threw her arms around the neck of Bonne-Biche, embraced Beau-Minon tenderly and said to them :\n\n“Oh ! my dear true good friend, what a debt of gratitude I owe you for having thus watched over my childhood and developed my intellect and my heart. I feel how much I have improved in every respect and I owe it all to you. “\n\nBonne-Biche returned her caresses and Beau-Minon patted her hand delicately. After the first few happy moments had passed, Blondine cast down her eyes and said timidly:\n\n“Do not think me ungrateful, my dear good friends, if I wish you to add one more to the benefits you have already conferred upon me. Tell me something about my father. Does he still weep in my absence? Is he happy since he lost me? “\n\n“Dear Blondine, your anxiety on this point is most natural and shall be relieved. Look in this mirror, Blondine, and you shall see the king your father and all that has passed since you left the palace. “\n\nBlondine raised her eyes to the mirror and looked into the apartment of her father. The king seemed very agitated and was walking backwards and forwards. He appeared to be expecting someone. The queen, Fourbette, entered and related to him that notwithstanding the remonstrances of Gourmandinet, Blondine had herself seized the reins and guided the ostriches who becoming frightened dashed off in the direction of the Forest of Lilacs and overturned the carriage. Blondine was thrown over the grating which bound the forest. She stated that Gourmandinet had become insane from terror and grief and she had sent him home to his parents. The king was in wild despair at this news. He ran to the Forest of Lilacs and he had to be held by force from throwing himself across the boundary in order to search for his cherished Blondine. They carried him to the palace where he yielded to the most frightful sorrow and despair, calling unceasingly upon his dear Blondine, his beloved child. At last, overcome by grief, he slept and saw in a dream Blondine in the castle of Bonne-Biche and Beau-Minon. Bonne-Biche gave him the sweet assurance that Blondine should one day be restored to him and that her childhood should be calm and happy.\n\nThe mirror now became misty and everything disappeared, then again clear as crystal and Blondine saw her father a second time. He had become old, his hair was white as snow and his countenance was sad. He held in his hand a little portrait of Blondine, his tears fell upon it and he pressed it often to his lips. The king was alone. Blondine saw neither the queen nor Brunette.\n\nPoor Blondine wept bitterly.\n\n“Alas! “ said she, “why is my dear father alone? Where is the queen? Where is Brunette? “\n\n“The queen, “ said Bonne-Biche, “showed so little grief at your death, my princess, that your father‘s heart was filled with hatred and suspicion towards her and he sent her back to the king Turbulent, her father, who confined her in a tower, where she soon died of rage and anger. All the world supposed you to be dead. As to your sister Brunette, she became so wicked, so insupportable, that the king hastened to give her in marriage last year to the prince Violent, who charged himself with the duty of reforming the character of the cruel and envious princess Brunette. The prince was stern and harsh. Brunette saw that her wicked heart prevented her from being happy and she commenced trying to correct her faults. You will see her again someday, dear\n\nBlondine and your example may complete her reformation. “ Blondine thanked Bonne-Biche tenderly for all these details. Her heart prompted her to ask, “But when shall I see my father and sister? “ But she feared to appear ungrateful and too anxious to leave the castle of her good friends. She resolved then to await another more suitable opportunity to ask this question.\n\nThe days passed away quietly and pleasantly. Blondine was much occupied but was sometimes melancholy. She had no one to talk with but Bonne-Biche and she was only with her during the hours of lessons and repasts. Beau-Minon could not converse and could only make himself understood by signs. The gazelles served Blondine with zeal and intelligence but they had not the gift of speech.\n\nBlondine walked every day, always accompanied by Beau-Minon, who pointed out to her the most lovely and sequestered paths and the rarest and richest flowers.\n\nBonne-Biche had made Blondine promise solemnly never to leave the enclosure of the park and never to enter the forest. Many times Blondine had asked Bonne-Biche the reason for this prohibition.\n\nSigning profoundly, she had replied:\n\n“Ah, Blondine ! do not seek to penetrate the forest. It is a fatal spot. May you never enter there. “\n\nSometimes Blondine mounted a pavilion that was built on an eminence near the boundary of the forest. She looked admiringly and longingly at the magnificent trees, the lovely and fragrant flowers, the thousand graceful birds flying and singing and seeming to call her name.\n\n“Alas! “ said she, “why will not Bonne-Biche allow me to walk in this beautiful forest? What possible danger can I encounter in that lovely place and under her protection? “\n\nWhenever she was lost in these reflections, Beau-Minon, who seemed to comprehend what was passing in her heart, mewed plaintively, pulled her robe and tried to draw her from the pavilion.\n\nBlondine smiled sweetly, followed her gentle company ion and recommended her to walk in the solitary park."

It had scanty hair and a weak composition face, a calico body and foolish feet that always turned inwards instead of outwards, and from which the sawdust now and then oozed. Yet in its glass eyes, there was an expression of amusement; they seemed to be looking not at you but through you, and the pursed-up red lips were always smiling at what the glass eyes saw.\n\n“Well, you are a doll, “ the boy said, looking up from his French exercise. “And what are you staring at me for is there anything behind? “ he asked, looking over his a shoulder. The doll made no answer. “And whatever are you smiling for? “ he asked; “I believe you are always smiling. I believe you‘d go on if I didn‘t do my exercise till next year, or if the cat died, or the monument tumbled down. “ But still the doll smiled in silence, and the boy went on with his exercise. Presently he looked up again and yawned. “I think I‘ll go for a stroll, “ he said and put his book by. “I know what I‘ll do, “ he said, suddenly; “I‘ll take that doll and hang it up to the apple tree to scare away the sparrows. “ And calling out, “Sis, I have taken your doll; I‘m going to make a scarecrow of it, “ he went off to the garden.\n\nHis sister rushed after him, crying out, “Oh, my poor doll! oh, my dear little doll!

It went smiling away like anything when I could not do my French. “\n\n“It has no heart. Of course, it can‘t feel. “\n\n“Why hasn‘t it got a heart?\n\n“Because it isn‘t alive. You ought to be sorry for it, and very, very kind to it, poor thing. “ “Well, what is it always smiling for? “ “Because it is so good, “ answered Sis, bursting into tears. “It is never bad-tempered; it never complains, and it never did anything unkind, “ and, kissing it tenderly, “you are always good and sweet, “ she said, “and always look smiling, though you must be very unhappy at not being alive. “"

None of the Taxi rickshaws stopped for us, except one.\n\nThe driver asked us where we wanted to go and we told him the place. Without talking anything about the fare, he said, ‘please get in!‘ We thanked the Taxi driver for stopping for us.\n\nSince it was very cold, I asked the driver to stop in the middle of any small restaurant or a tea shop. We liked to have a cup of hot tea. The driver stopped near a small restaurant.\n\nWe ordered tea and asked the driver to join us and have a cup of tea. The driver refused. I insisted he take a cup as it could be refreshing.\n\nAgain the driver refused to drink tea.\n\nMy friend asked, ‘Will you not take tea from this shop or what?‘\n\nThe driver replied, ‘No Sir, I don‘t feel like having tea now.‘\n\nI asked again, ‘But, why?

His conscience was clear andhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep.

He looked at the workmanship; there was not one falsestitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite amasterpiece.\n\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well thathe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poorshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairsmore.

All the morning he stood by the road-side, offering his flowers to the passers-by, but no one took any notice of him, and his face grew sad and troubled. “Poor mother! “ he said, longingly; and the flowers heard him, and sighed.\n\n“Those violets are very sweet, “ a lady said as she passed; the boy ran after her.\n\n“Only a penny, “ he said, “just one penny, for mother is at home. “ Then the lady bought them and carried them to the beautiful house in which she lived, and gave them some water, touching them so softly that the poor violets forgot to long for the woods, and looked gratefully up into her face.\n\n“Mother, “ said the boy, “see, I have brought some bread for your breakfast. The violets sent it to you, “ and he put the little loaf down before her.\n\nThe birds knew nothing of all this and went on singing till the ground was covered with flowers, till the leaves had hidden the brown branches of the trees, and the pathway through the woods was all shade, save for the sunshine that flecked it with light."

      "body": "The Adventures Of Chanticleer And Partlet:\n\n‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet, ‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can, before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’\n\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now, duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good pace.\n\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’ and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to tread on Partlet’s toes.\n\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\n\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\n\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. ‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\n\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VIST MR KORBES\n\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together; so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage, and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\n\n'All on our way  A visit to pay  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.'\nThen the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\n\n'Take care of this handsome coach of mine,  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!  Now, mice, be ready,  And, wheels, run steady!  For we are going a visit to pay  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.'\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with them.\n\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself up in the towel.\n\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.\n\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\n\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more.\n\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\n\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across, and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\n\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her. Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead."

      "body": "Lily And The Lion:\n\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels; but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all three, and bid them goodbye.\n\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked dreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\n\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you; can nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when I go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return.\n\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep, saying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\n\nBut she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let me come safe home again.’\n\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself, she knew not whither, till the night came again.\n\nAfter some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in your father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\n\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this time—you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church, and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her, ‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me free.’\n\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove. ‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s top and the valley’s depth—hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a casket—open it when thy hour of need comes.’\n\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove—hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg— break it when need comes.’\n\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf—hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove—he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods—count them, and when thou comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to your home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind. ‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the sea.’\n\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off carrying the prince away with her.\n\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’ said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be sold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’ The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’ At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\n\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’\n\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the chamberlain told him all—how he had given him a sleeping draught, and how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.’\n\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea. When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water, and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days."

      "body": "The Proud Red Rose:\n\nOne beautiful spring day a red rose blossomed in a forest. Many kinds of trees and plants grew there. As the rose looked around, a pine tree nearby said, “What a beautiful flower. I wish I was that lovely. “ Another tree said, “Dear pine, do not be sad, we can not\n\nhave everything. “\n\nThe rose turned its head and remarked, “It seems that I am the most beautiful plant in this forest. “ A sunflower raised its yellow head and asked, “Why do you say that? In this forest, there are many beautiful plants. You are just one of them. “ The red rose replied, “I see everyone looking at me and admiring me. “ Then the rose looked at a cactus and said, “Look at that ugly plant full of thorns! “ The pine tree said, “Red rose, what kind of talk is this? Who can say what beauty is? You have thorns too. “\n\nThe proud red rose looked angrily at the pine and said, “I thought you had good taste! You do not know what beauty is at all. You can not compare my thorns to that of the cactus. “\n\n“What a proud flower “, thought the trees.\n\nThe rose tried to move its roots away from the cactus, but it could not move. As the days passed, the red rose would look at the cactus and say insulting things, like This plant is useless? How sorry I am to be his neighbor.\n\nThe cactus never got upset and he even tried to advise the rose, saying, “God did not create any form of life without a purpose. “\n\nSpring passed, and the weather became very warm. Life became difficult in the forest, as the plants and animals needed water and no rain fell. The red rose began to wilt. One day the rose saw sparrows stick their beaks into the cactus and then fly away, refreshed. This was puzzling, and the red rose asked the pine tree what the birds were doing. The pine tree explained that the birds got water from the cactus. “Does it not hurt when they make holes? “ asked the rose.\n\n“Yes, but the cactus does not like to see any birds suffer, “ replied the pine.\n\nThe rose opened its eyes in wonder and said, “The cactus has water? “\n\n“Yes, you can also drink from it. The sparrow can bring water to you if you ask the cactus for help. “\n\nThe red rose felt too ashamed of its past words and behavior to ask for water from the cactus, but then it finally did ask the cactus for help. The cactus kindly agreed and the birds filled their beaks with water and watered the rose‘s roots. Thus the rose learned a lesson and never judged anyone by their appearance again."

      "body": "The Shirt Collar:\n\nThere was once a perfect gentleman whose whole household goods consisted of one bootjack and a comb. But he also had one of the most remarkable shirt collars in the world. I'll tell you a story about it.\n\nWhen the shirt collar had passed his prime he turned his thoughts to marriage. In the fullness of time he went to the wash, and there he met with a garter.\n\n\"My!\" said the collar, \"anyone so slender, so tender, so neat and nice as you are, I never did see. May I know your name?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the garter. \"I won't tell you.\"\n\n\"Then at least tell me where you live?\" asked the collar.\n\nBut the garter was so modest that she couldn't bring herself to answer such an embarrassing question.\n\n\"I believe you are a girdle,\" said the collar. \"A sort of underneath girdle. And I dare say you're as useful as you are beautiful, my pretty little dear.\"\n\n\"I forbid you to speak to me,\" said the garter. \"I'm sure I haven't given you the slightest encouragement.\"\n\n\"Your beauty is every encouragement,\" said the collar.\n\n\"Kindly keep away from me,\" said the garter. \"You look too masculine.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm a perfect gentleman,\" said the collar. \"I've a bootjack and a comb to prove it.\"\n\nThis wasn't true at all, for they belonged to his master, but he liked to boast.\n\n\"Please don't come so close,\" said the garter. \"I'm not used to such behaviour.\"\n\n\"Prude!\" the collar called her as they took him from the washtub. They starched him, hung him over a chair back in the sun, and then stretched him out on an ironing board. There he met with a sadiron.\n\n\"My dear lady,\" said the collar, \"you adorable widow woman, the closer you come the warmer I feel. I'm a changed collar since I met you, without a wrinkle left in me. You burn clear through me. Oh, won't you be mine?\"\n\n\"Rag!\" said the sadiron, as she flattened him out, for she went her way like a railway engine pulling cars down a track. \"Rag!\" was what she said.\n\nThe collar was the worse for wear at the edges, so the scissors were called for to trim him.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the collar, \"you must be a ballet dancer. How straight you stretch your legs out. Such a graceful performance! No one can do that like you.\"\n\n\"I'm well aware of it,\" said the scissors.\n\n\"You deserve to be no less than a countess,\" said the collar. \"All I have to offer is my perfect gentleman, bootjack and comb. Oh, if only I had an earldom.\"\n\n\"I do believe he's daring to propose,\" said the scissors. She cut him so furiously that he never recovered.\n\n\"Now I shall have to ask the comb,\" said the collar. \"My dear, how remarkably well you've kept your teeth. Have you ever thought of getting engaged?\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" said the comb. \"I am engaged-to the bootjack.\"\n\n\"Engaged!\" the collar exclaimed. Now that there was no one left for him to court, the collar pretended that he had never meant to marry.\n\nTime passed and the collar went his way to the bin in a paper mill, where the rags kept company according to rank, the fine rags in one bin, the coarse in another, just as it is in the world. They all gossiped aplenty but the collar chattered the most, for he was an awful braggart.\n\n\"I've had sweethearts by the dozen,\" he told them. \"Ladies never would leave me alone, and you can't blame them; for I was such a perfect gentleman, stiff with starch, and with a bootjack and comb to spare. You should have seen me then. You should have seen me unbend.\n\n\"I'll never forget my first love-such a charming little girdle, so slender and tender. She threw herself into a tub of water, all for the love of me. Then there was the widow, glowing to get me, but I jilted her and let her cool off. And there was the ballet dancer, whose mark I bear to this day. What a fiery creature she was! And even my comb fell so hard in love with me that she lost all her teeth when I left her. Yes, indeed, I have plenty on my conscience. But the garter-I mean the girdle - who drowned herself in the wash tub, is the one I feel most badly about. Oh, I have a black record, and it's high time I turned into spotless white paper.\"\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened. All the rags were made into paper, and the collar became the page you see, the very paper on which this story is printed. That was because he boasted so outrageously about things that never had happened. So let's be careful to behave we better than he did, for you never can tell. Some day we may end up in the rag bag, and be made into white paper on which the whole story of our life is printed in full detail. Then we'd have to turn tattletale on ourselves, just as the shirt collar has done."

      "body": "The Fairy Ring:\n\nA little old man with a violin tucked under his arm shuffled down the attic steps and the many flights of stairs until finally he reached the streets.\n\nAs he shuffled down the street, he clutched his coat tightly about his throat, for the air was chill and he felt the cold.\n\nAt the first street corner he stopped and placed his violin to his shoulder to play, but catching a glance from the policeman across the street he hastily tucked his violin under his arm and shuffled on.\n\nHe walked a great distance before he again stopped.\n\nIt was a busy corner where hundreds of people passed every few minutes, but when he played no one stopped to listen to his music, much less to drop anything in the tiny tin cup he had placed on the sidewalk before him.\n\nTears came to the poor little old man’s eyes; everyone was too busy to stop to hear his music.\n\nSo in the evening when he slowly retraced his steps towards his attic home, his feet were very tired and he shuffled more than he had in the morning. His back humped and his head drooped more, and the tears nearly blinded him. He had to stop and rest at each flight of stairs and he fell to his knees just as he reached the attic door.\n\nHe sat there and rested awhile, then caught hold of the doorknob and raised himself to his feet.\n\nA quaint little white-haired woman greeted him with a cheery smile as he entered, then, seeing his sad face, she turned her head and tears came to her eyes.\n\n“Honey!” the little old man sobbed, as he stumbled towards her chair and fell to his knees before her, burying his face in her lap.\n\nNeither could say a word for a long time, then the little old man told her he had been unable to make a single penny by playing.\n\n“No one cares to hear an old man play the violin!” he said. “No one cares that we go hungry and cold! And I can still play,” he added fiercely, “just as well as ever I could! Listen to this!” and the little old man stood up and drew his bow across the violin strings in a sure, fiery manner, so that the lamp chimney rattled and sang with the vibrations of the strings.\n\nAnd in his fierceness he improvised a melody so wild and beautiful his sister sat entranced.\n\nAs the little old man finished the melody he stood still more upright. Then straightening his old shoulders and pulling his hat firmly on his head, he stooped and kissed the old lady and walked with a firm tread to the door.\n\n“I shall make them take notice tonight!” he cried. “I shall return with success!”\n\nSo again he went down the long flights of stairs and down the street until he came to a good corner where traffic was heavy.\n\nThere, with the mood upon him which had fired him in the attic, he played again the wild melody.\n\nA few people hesitated as they passed, but only one stopped. This was an old woman, bent and wrinkled, who helped herself along with a cane. She stopped and looked him squarely in the eye and the little old man felt he should recognize her, but he could not remember where he had seen her before, nor was he sure that he had ever looked upon her until now.\n\nAt any rate, the faint memory inspired him and, raising his violin, he played a beautiful lullaby.\n\nBefore he had finished the old woman leaned over and dropped something into his little tin cup.\n\nIt sounded as loud as a silver dollar would have sounded.\n\n“The dear old generous soul!” the old man thought as he continued playing.\n\nHe played for hours, but the old woman was the only one who stopped. “I will at least have enough to get Cynthia some warm food!” he said, thinking of what the old lady had dropped into his tin cup.\n\nBut when he looked, what was his dismay to see only a large iron ring!\n\nAgain he climbed the stairs to the attic but he felt too weary to say a thing and his sister knew that he had met with disappointment. He tossed the iron ring to her lap and went over to the bed and threw himself upon it.\n\n“This is the end!” he said, and told her about the iron ring.\n\n“The old woman seemed interested in my playing!” he said, “And perhaps she gave all she could give!”\n\n“Let us not be downhearted, Brother!” said the sister. “Surely tomorrow you will find someone who will reward your talent!”\n\nThe little old man was quiet for a long time and then he arose and again drew his bow across the violin strings. The old lady sat very still and dreamed, for her brother was playing one of their childhood songs.\n\nAs she lost herself in reverie, she turned the iron ring around her finger and saw upon its surface, as she turned it, the faces of her playmates of long ago.\n\nAnd as the brother swept from one melody to another, she saw the iron ring change color and grow larger and larger.\n\nAnd, as she turned it, she saw the figures of her childhood playmates turn before her upon her lap, and they joined their voices with the silvery notes of the violin’s long ago songs until the attic was filled with the melody and the figures danced from her lap and, taking her by the hand, circled in the center of the attic room laughing and singing.\n\nThe little old man had been playing with his eyes closed, but as the songs grew louder he opened them and beheld the ring of little figures, with his sister holding hands with two of them. And, rising from the bed, still playing the childhood songs of long ago, he walked to the center of the room. As he did so, the figures rose in the air and seemed to grow lighter and larger. And suddenly the scene changed! He was out in the woods, with lofty trees towering above him, while all about, laughing and talking, were hundreds of little fairies, gnomes and sprites, and there, too, were the playmates of long ago, just as he had seen them when he had closed his eyes and played in the attic.\n\nAnd there, too, was his sister as she had been when a child. He looked at himself, and lo! he was no longer wrinkled and old. He was young again!\n\nIn his gladness he danced with joy, and catching his sister to his breast he kissed her again and again.\n\nAnd, looking about him with shining eyes, he again drew his bow across the strings and played a tune so lively and full of sweet happiness the childhood friends caught hands and danced in a circle, and the little sprites, elves, gnomes and fairies caught hands and danced around the children, and as they passed before the brother he caught a mischievous glance from the eyes of one of the little fairies, and he knew in a moment she was the one who had played the old woman, and who had given him the iron ring….\n\nThe people who lived in the room below the attic room missed the little old man’s shuffling step, and, not hearing it for two days, they told the landlady, a kindly soul who had let the brother and sister have the attic room free of charge, and all went up to investigate….\n\nThey rapped upon the attic door. All was quiet within. Timidly they opened the door and looked in. There upon the floor lay an old rusty iron ring. It was the Fairy Ring."

      "body": "The Wolf And The Seven Little Kids:\n\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all seven to her and said, \"Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will devour you all - skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.\"\n\nThe kids said, \"Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety.\" Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.\n\nIt was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called, \"Open the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought something back with her for each of you.\" But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice.\n\n\"We will not open the door,\" cried they, \"you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough, you are the wolf.\"\n\nThen the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it. The he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called, \"Open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you.\"\n\nBut the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried, \"We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf.\"\n\nThen the wolf ran to a baker and said, \"I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me. And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said, \"Strew some white meal over my feet for me.\" The miller thought to himself, the wolf wants to deceive someone, and refused, but the wolf said, \"If you will not do it, I will devour you.\" Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him.\n\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at it and said, \"Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her.\"\n\nThe little kids cried, \"First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother.\"\n\nThen he put his paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the wolf. The kids were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep.\n\nSoon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah, what a sight she saw there. The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but no one answered.\n\nAt last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice cried, \"Dear Mother, I am in the clock-case.\" She took the kid out, and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\n\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her. When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. Ah, heavens, she thought, is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?\n\nThen the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread and the goat cut open the monster's stomach, and hardly had she make one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and when she cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.\n\nWhat rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a sailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said, \"Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast's stomach with them while he is still asleep.\" Then the seven kids dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as they could get in, and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.\n\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he,\n\n\"What rumbles and tumbles\nAgainst my poor bones?\nI thought 'twas six kids,\nBut it feels like big stones.\"\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the heavy stones made him fall in, and he had to drown miserably.\n\nWhen the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud, \"The wolf is dead, the wolf is dead,\" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother."

      "body": "The Golden Bird:\n\nTHERE was once a King who had a beautiful pleasure-garden behind his palace, in which grew a tree that bore golden apples. As fast as the apples ripened they were counted, but the next day one was always missing.\n\nThis was made known to the King, who commanded that a watch should be kept every night under the tree. Now, the King had three sons, and he sent the eldest into the garden when night was coming on; but at midnight he fell fast asleep, and in the morning another apple was missing. The following night the second son had to watch, but he did not succeed any better, and again another apple was missing in the morning. Now came the turn of the youngest son, who was eager to go; but the King did not rely much upon him, and thought he would watch even worse than his brothers; however, at last he agreed.\n\nThe youth threw himself on the ground under the tree and watched steadily, without letting sleep master him. As twelve o’clock struck, something rustled in the air, and he saw a bird fly by in the moonlight, whose feathers were of shining gold. The bird landed on the tree and was just picking off one of the apples when the young Prince shot a bolt at it. Away flew the bird, but the arrow had knocked off one of its feathers, which was of the finest gold. The youth picked it up and showed it to the King next morning, and told him all he had seen in the night.\n\nThereupon the King assembled his council, and each one declared that a single feather like this one was of greater value than the whole kingdom.\n\n“However valuable this feather may be,” said the King, “one will not be of much use to me—I must have the whole bird.”\n\nSo the eldest son went forth on his travels, to look for the wonderful bird, and he had no doubt that he would be able to find it.\n\nWhen he had gone a short distance, he saw a fox sitting close to the edge of the forest, so he drew his bow to shoot. But the fox cried out: “Do not shoot me, and I will give you a piece of good advice! You are now on the road to the golden bird, and this evening you will come to a village where two inns stand opposite to each other—one will be brilliantly lighted, and great merriment will be going on inside; do not, however, go in, but rather enter the other, even though it appears but a poor place to you.”\n\n“How can such a ridiculous animal give me good advice?” thought the young Prince, and shot at the fox, but missed it, so it ran away with its tail in the air. The King’s son then walked on, and in the evening he came to a village where the two inns stood: in one there was dancing and singing, but the other was quiet, and had a very mean and wretched appearance.\n\n“I should be an idiot,” thought he to himself, “if I were to go to this gloomy old inn while the other is so bright and cheerful.” Therefore, he went into the cheerful one, lived there in noisy merriment, and so forgot the golden bird, his father, and all good behavior.\n\nAs time passed away, and the eldest son did not return home, the second son set out on his travels to seek the golden bird. Like the eldest brother, he met with the fox, and did not follow the good advice it gave him. He likewise came to the two inns, and at the window of the noisy one his brother stood begging him to come in. This he could not resist, so he went in, and began to live a life of pleasure only.\n\nAgain a long time passed by without any news, so the youngest Prince wished to try his luck, but his father would not hear of it. At last, for the sake of peace, the King was obliged to agree, for he had no rest as long as he refused. The fox was again sitting at the edge of the forest, and once more it begged for its own life and gave its good advice. The youth was good-hearted, and said:\n\n“Have no fear, little fox; I will not do you any harm.”\n\n“You will never repent of thy good nature,” replied the fox, “and in order that you may travel more quickly, get up behind on my tail.”\n\nScarcely had the youth seated himself, when away went the fox over hill and dale, so fast that the Prince’s hair whistled in the wind. When they came to the village, the youth dismounted, and following the fox’s advice, he turned at once into the shabby-looking inn, where he slept peacefully through the night. The next morning, when the Prince went into the fields, the fox was already there, and said:\n\n“I will tell you what further you must do. Go straight on, and you will come to a castle before which a whole troop of soldiers will be lying asleep. Go right through the midst of them into the castle, and you will come to a chamber where is hanging a wooden cage containing a golden bird. Close by stands an empty golden cage, for show; but be careful that you do not take the bird out of its ugly cage and put it in the splendid one, or it will be very unlucky for you.”\n\nWith these words the fox once more stretched out its tail, and the King’s son sat upon it again, and away they went over hill and dale, with their hair whistling in the wind.\n\nWhen they arrived at the castle, the Prince found everything as the fox had said, and he soon discovered the room in which the golden bird was sitting in its wooden cage; by it stood a golden one; while three golden apples were lying about the room. But the Prince thought it would be silly to put such a lovely bird in so ugly and common a cage; so, opening the door, he placed it in the golden cage. In an instant the bird set up a piercing shriek, which awakened all the soldiers, who rushed in and made him prisoner.\n\nThe next morning he was brought before a judge, who at once condemned him to death. Still, the King said his life should be spared on one condition, and that was, that he brought him the golden horse, which ran faster than the wind; and if he succeeded he should also receive the golden bird as a reward.\n\nThe young Prince set out on his journey, but he sighed and felt very sorrowful, for where was he to find the golden horse? All at once, he saw his old friend, the fox, sitting by the wayside.\n\n“Ah!” exclaimed the fox, “you see now what has happened through not listening to me. But be of good courage; I will look after you, and tell you how you may discover the horse. You must travel straight along this road until you come to a castle; the horse is there in one of the stables. You will find a stable boy lying before the stall, but he will be fast asleep and snoring, so you will be able to lead out the golden horse quite quietly. But there is one thing you must be careful about, and that is to put on the shabby old saddle of wood and leather, and not the golden one which hangs beside it—otherwise everything will go wrong with you.” Then the fox stretched out his tail, the Prince took a seat upon it, and away they went over hill and dale, with their hair whistling in the wind.\n\nEverything happened as the fox had said. The Prince came to the stable where the golden horse was standing, but, as he was about to put on the shabby old saddle, he thought to himself, “It does seem a shame that such a lovely animal should be disgraced with this. The fine saddle is his by right; it must go on.”\n\nScarcely had the golden saddle rested on the horse’s back when it began to neigh loudly. This awakened the stable boy, who awakened the grooms, who rushed in and seized the Prince and made him a prisoner. The following morning he was brought to trial and condemned to death, but the King promised him his life, as well as the golden horse, if the youth could find the beautiful daughter of the King of the golden castle. Once more, with a heavy heart, the Prince set out on his journey, and by great good fortune he soon came across the faithful fox.\n\n“I really should have left you to the consequences of your mistake,” said the fox; “but as I feel sorry for you, I will help you out of your new misfortune. The path to the castle lies straight before you; you will reach it about the evening. At night, when everything is quiet, the lovely Princess will go to the bath-house, to bathe there. As soon as she enters, you must jump forward and give her a kiss; then she will follow you wherever you care to lead her; only be careful that she does not say goodbye to her parents, or everything will go wrong.”\n\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, the Prince seated himself on it, and away they both went over hill and dale, their hair whistling in the wind.\n\nWhen the King’s son came to the golden palace, everything happened as the fox had predicted. He waited until midnight, and when everyone was soundly asleep the beautiful Princess went into the bath-house, so he sprang forward and kissed her. The Princess then said she would joyfully follow him, but she besought him with tears in her eyes to allow her to say farewell to her parents. At first he withstood her requests, but as she wept still more, and fell at his feet, he at last gave in.\n\nScarcely was the maiden at the bedside of her father, when he awoke, and so did everyone else in the palace; so the foolish youth was captured and put into prison.\n\nOn the following morning the King said to him: “Your life is forfeited, and you can only find mercy if you clear away the mountain that lies before my windows, and over which I cannot see, but it must be removed within eight days. If you succeed you shall have my daughter as a reward.”\n\nSo the Prince commenced at once to dig and to shovel away the earth without cessation, but when after seven days he saw how little he had been able to accomplish, and that all his labor was as nothing, he fell into a great grief and gave up all hope.\n\nOn the evening of the seventh day, however, the fox appeared. “You don’t  deserve that I should help you or befriend you, but go away and lie down to sleep, and I will do the work for you.”\n\nAnd the next morning, when he awoke and looked out of the window, the mountain had disappeared! Then the Prince, quite overjoyed, hastened to the King and told him that the conditions were fulfilled, so that the King, whether he wanted to or not, was obliged to keep his word and give him his daughter.\n\nThen these two went away together, and it was not long before the faithful fox came to them.\n\n“You have indeed gained the best of all,” said he, “but to the maiden of the golden castle belongs also the golden horse.”\n\n“How can I get it?” asked the youth.\n\n“I will tell you,” answered the fox; “first of all, take the lovely Princess to the King who sent you to the golden palace. There will then be unheard-of joy; they will gladly lead the golden horse to you and give it you. Mount it instantly, and give your hand to everyone at parting, and last of all to the Princess. Grasp her hand firmly; make her spring into the saddle behind you, and then gallop away; no one will be able to overtake you, for the golden horse runs faster than the wind.”\n\nThis was all happily accomplished, and the King’s son carried off the beautiful Princess on the golden horse. The fox did not remain behind, and spoke again to the young Prince:\n\n“Now I will help you to find the golden bird. When you come near the castle where the bird is to be found, let the Princess dismount, and I will take her under my protection. Then ride on the golden horse to the courtyard of the palace, where your coming will cause great joy, and they will fetch the golden bird for you. As soon as the cage is in your hands, gallop back to us and fetch the maiden again.”\n\nWhen this plot was successfully carried out, and the Prince was about to ride home with his treasure, the fox said, “Now you must reward me for all my services.”\n\n“What is it that you desire?” asked the Prince.\n\n“When we come to yonder wood, you must shoot me dead and cut off my head and paws.”\n\n“That would be a fine sort of gratitude,” said the King’s son; “that I cannot possibly promise you.”\n\n“Then,” replied the fox, “if you will not, I must leave you; but before I go I will give you again some good advice. Beware of two things—do not pay to release any prisoners, and see that you don’t sit on the side of a well!”\n\nWith this the fox ran off into the forest!\n\n“Ah!” thought the young Prince, “that is a wonderful animal with very funny ideas! Who would buy gallows’-flesh, and when have I ever had the slightest desire to sit on the brink of a well?”\n\nSo he rode on with the beautiful maiden, and his path led him once more through the village in which his two brothers had stopped. Here there was great noise and excitement, and when he asked what it all meant, he was told that two men were going to be punished for bad deeds. When he came nearer, he saw that they were his two brothers, who had committed every kind of wicked folly and had squandered all their money. Then the young Prince asked if they could not be freed.\n\n“Supposing you do pay for them,” the people answered, “where is the good of wasting your money in order to free such villains?”\n\nNevertheless, he did not hesitate, but paid for them, and when the brothers were freed they all rode away together. They came to the forest where they first encountered the fox, and as it was cool and pleasant away from the burning sun, the two brothers said:\n\n“Let us sit and rest a little by this well, and eat and drink something.”\n\nThe young Prince consented, and while they were all talking together he quite forgot the fox’s warning, and suspected no evil.\n\nBut suddenly the two brothers threw him backwards into the well, and, seizing the maiden, the horse, and the golden bird, they went home to their father.\n\n“We not only bring you the golden bird,” said they, “but we have also found the golden palace.”\n\nThere was great rejoicing, but the horse would not eat, neither would the bird sing, and the maiden only sat and wept.\n\nBut the youngest brother had not perished. By good fortune the well was dry, and he had fallen on soft moss without hurting himself, but he could not get out again.\n\nEven in this misfortune the faithful fox did not desert him, but came springing down to him and scolded him for not following his advice.\n\n“Still I cannot forsake you,” said he, “and I will help to show you daylight once more.”\n\nThen he told him to seize hold of his tail and hold on tightly; and so saying, he lifted him up in the air.\n\n“Even now you are not out of danger,” said the fox, “for your brothers were not certain of your death, and have set spies to watch for you in the forest, who will certainly kill you if they see you.”\n\nThere was an old man sitting by the road with whom the young Prince changed clothes, and, so disguised, he reached the court of the King.\n\nNo one recognized him, but the golden bird began to sing, and the golden horse started to eat, and the lovely maiden stopped crying.\n\nThe King was astonished and asked: “What does this all mean?”\n\nThen said the maiden: “I know not, but I was so sad, and now I feel light-hearted; it is as if my true husband had returned.”\n\nThen she told him all that had happened, although the other brothers had threatened to kill her if she betrayed them.\n\nThe King then summoned all the people in the castle before him: and there came with them the young Prince dressed as a beggar in his rags, but the maiden recognized him instantly and fell upon his neck.\n\nSo the wicked brothers were seized and thrown in prison, but the young Prince married the lovely Princess and was made his father’s heir.\n\nBut what became of the poor fox?\n\nLong afterwards the young Prince went again into the forest, and there he met once more with the fox, who said:\n\n“You now everything in the world you desire, but to my misfortunes there can be no end, although it is in your power to release me from them.”\n\nSo he begged the Prince to shoot him dead and cut off his head and feet.\n\nAt last the Prince agreed to do so, and scarcely was the deed done than the fox was changed into a man, who was no other than the brother of the beautiful Princess, at last released from the spell that had trapped him for so long.\n\nSo now nothing was left to prevent to the happiness of the Prince and his bride as long as they lived."

      "body": "The Mouse,  the Bird,  and the Sausage:\n\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered intopartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to addconsiderably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into thewood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausagesaw to the cooking.\n\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for somethingnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met afellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of hishousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him forbeing a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the othertwo stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mousehad made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into herlittle room and rest until it was time to set the table. The sausage hadonly to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, andwhen it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth,or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, andthere they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. Then,when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat downto table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep theirfill till the following morning: and that was really a verydelightful life.\n\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring inthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant longenough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was nowtime to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging thework. Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of nouse; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture hadto be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage tobring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch thewater.\n\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, thebird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these twowaited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day.But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and thebird flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he cameacross a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as hislegitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The birdcomplained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing hesaid was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found falsecredentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had beenforfeited.\n\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all hehad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make thebest of things and to remain with one another.\n\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the foodand, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rollingin and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumpedinto the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom,having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also withlife.\n\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but hecould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the woodhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook wasto be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly throwndown, caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch somewater, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as hewas unable to recover himself, he was drowned."

      "body": "Sweetheart Roland:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a woman who was truly a witch. She had two daughters, one ugly and wicked, whom she loved because she was her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, whom she hated, because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter had a beautiful apron, which the other girl wanted so much that she became envious, and she told her mother that she just had to have that apron.\n\n\"Be still, my child,\" said the old woman, \"and you shall have it. Your stepsister has long deserved to die, and tonight when she is asleep I will come and chop off her head. Just be sure to lie down at the far side of the bed, and push her close to the front.\"\n\nIt would have been all over with the poor girl, but just then she was standing in a corner, and she overheard everything. She was not allowed to go outside all day long, and at bedtime her wicked stepsister had her get into bed first, so she would be lying next to the wall. However, after the witch's daughter fell asleep, the stepdaughter gently pushed her to the front side of the bed, and she took her place back against the wall.\n\nIn the night the old woman crept into the bedroom holding an ax in her right hand while feeling with her left hand for anyone lying at the front of the bed. Then she grasped the axe with both hands and chopped off her own child's head.\n\nAfter the witch had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, whose name was Roland, and knocked at his door.\n\nWhen he came out, she said to him, \"Listen, dearest Roland, we must flee at once. My stepmother tried to kill me, but she killed her own child instead. When daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we'll be lost.\"\n\n\"You had better take her magic wand,\" said Roland, \"or we will not be able to escape if she comes after us.\"\n\nThe girl got the magic wand, then she took the dead girl's head and dropped three drops of blood onto the floor, one in front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the steps. Then she hurried away with her sweetheart.\n\nThe next morning when the old witch got up, she called her daughter, wanting to give her the apron. But the daughter did not come.\n\nSo she shouted, \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Here on the steps. I'm sweeping,\" answered the first drop of blood.\n\nThe old woman went out, but seeing no one on the steps, she shouted again, \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Here in the kitchen. I'm warming myself,\" shouted the second drop of blood.\n\nShe went into the kitchen, but found no one.\n\nSo she shouted again, \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"Here in the bed. I'm sleeping,\" shouted the third drop of blood.\n\nShe went into the bedroom and approached the bed. What did she see there? Her own child swimming in blood and whose head she herself had cut off.\n\nThe witch flew into a rage, jumped to the window, and as she could see far into the world, she saw her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland.\n\n\"That won't help you!\" shouted the witch. \"Even if you've already gone a long way, you won't escape from me!\"\n\nShe put on her many-league boots, in which she covered an hour's walk with every step, and it was not long before she overtook them. However, when the girl saw the old woman striding toward them, she used the magic wand to transform her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck swimming in the middle of the lake.\n\nThe witch stood on the shore and threw in pieces of bread, trying with great effort to lure the duck to her. But the duck did not give in, and the old woman had to return home that night without success. Afterward the girl and her sweetheart Roland returned to their natural shapes, and they walked on through the whole night until daybreak. Then the girl transformed herself into a beautiful flower in the middle of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart Roland into a fiddler.\n\nIt was not long before the witch came striding up toward them.\n\nShe said to the musician, \"Dear musician, may I pick that beautiful flower for myself?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied. \"And I will play for you while you're doing it.\"\n\nShe crawled hastily into the hedge and was just about to pick the flower, knowing perfectly well who it was, when he began to play. She was forced to dance, whether she wanted to or not, for it was magic dance music. The faster he played, the more violently she was forced to jump. The thorns tore the clothes off her body, pricking her until she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance until she fell down dead.\n\nThey were now free, so Roland said, \"Now I will go to my father and arrange for our wedding.\"\n\n\"I'll stay here and wait for you,\" said the girl. \"And I'll transform myself into a red boundary stone, so that no one will recognize me.\"\n\nSo Roland set forth, and the girl, in the shape of a red boundary stone, stood there and waited for her sweetheart. But when Roland arrived home, he was snared by another woman, who caused him to forget the girl. The poor girl waited there a long time.\n\nFinally, when he failed to return, she grew sad and transformed herself into a flower, thinking, \"Someone will surely come this way and trample me down.\"\n\nHowever, it happened that a shepherd who was herding his sheep in the field saw the flower. As it was so beautiful, he picked it, took it home with him, and put it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened in the shepherd's house. When he arose in the morning all the work was already done. The room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire on the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was already set, and a good dinner served. He didn't know how this happened, for he never saw anyone in his house, and no one could have hidden himself in it.\n\nHe was, of course, pleased with this good service, but with time he became so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice.\n\nThe wise woman said, \"There is magic behind it. Be on the watch very early some morning, and if anything is moving in the room, if you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped.\"\n\nThe shepherd did what she told him to do, and the next morning just at dawn, he saw the chest open and the flower come out. He quickly jumped towards it and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that she had been doing his housekeeping. She told him her story. He liked her and asked her to marry him, but she answered, \"No,\" for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart Roland, even though he had abandoned her. Nevertheless, she promised not to go away, and to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\n\nThe time drew near when Roland was to be married. According to an old custom in that country, it was announced that all the girls were to attend the wedding and sing in honor of the bridal pair. When the faithful girl heard this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she did not want to go. But the other girls came and took her. When it was her turn to sing, she declined, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse.\n\nBut when she began her song, and it reached Roland's ears, he jumped up and shouted, \"I know that voice. That is the true bride. I do not want anyone else.\" Everything he had forgotten, and which had vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart.\n\nThus the faithful girl was married to her sweetheart Roland. Her grief came to an end, and her joy began."

      "body": "The Tale Of How The Tiger Got His Stripes:\n\nLong time ago, ages ago, it was said that the tiger was like a lion without any stripes on his back, and the rabbit had a long tail.\n\nThe tiger had a big farm that need attending to, as it was overgrown with brush. Therefore, the tiger was searching for workers to clear the undergrowth.\n\nThe tiger called the animals and said, \"I am in need of a good worker to clean this place. I shall offer a buffalo in payment for whoever does this work the quickest.\"\n\nThe monkey called in first and said that he would like to do the job. So, the tiger assigned the job to him. However, the tiger, to his dismay, found out that the monkey was very slow. Therefore, the tiger fired him as quickly as he hired him.\n\nThe goat was the next on the list. Although the goat was a good worker, he could never concentrate nor focus. He would work on one part of the field and then move away to another part, without finishing the area that he was working on. As expected, the tiger fired him without any pay.\n\nThe armadillo was the next to be tried. It was the same story with the armadillo as well. He was a good worker, but the moment he saw any ants, he would stop and finish of the lot. As a result, work suffered. Therefore, he too was fired without pay.\n\nFinally, a rabbit came forward. The tiger was a bit surprised and laughed at him and said,\" how are you going to complete the work, where these animals had failed?\"\n\nAnyway, the tiger decided to try him.\n\nThe tiger was surprised to note that the rabbit was a hard worker. He quickly cleared most of the farm. Seeing his hard work, the tiger decided to take a break, and asked his son to watch over the rabbit.\n\nThe rabbit noted that the tiger had left. Therefore, he asked the tiger's son, \"Where is the buffalo that your father is going to give me? Is it kept by the side of the river?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the son.\n\nThe rabbit decided to take the buffalo, without completing the work. Just as he was leaving, the tiger entered and noticed that the rabbit was about to leave. He then ensured that he stayed until the work was complete. The work was complete and the tiger gave the buffalo to the rabbit, as promised.\n\nThe tiger then said, \"If you plan to eat this buffalo, eat it in a place where there are no mosquitoes.\"\n\nThe rabbit went away with the buffalo. After going some distance, he felt hungry and thought of butchering the buffalo. He looked around and saw there was a farm close by and mosquitoes as well. So, he decided not to kill the buffalo and went ahead a little more. Finally, he came close to a river, and there was strong breeze. He looked around and did not see any mosquitoes.\n\nAs he was about to butcher the buffalo, the tiger came along and said, \"I am very hungry, and will you share the buffalo with me.\"\n\nThe rabbit, out of fear, gave a piece of meat to the tiger, which the tiger gulped it in a moment. He then asked the rabbit, \"Is that all what you are going to give me? I am such a good friend of yours and I am sure you will give me more.\"\n\nThe rabbit, out of fear, gave more to the tiger. Soon, he had finished most of the buffalo's meat. The rabbit had managed to get only a small piece and was furious. He decided to teach the tiger a lesson.\n\nFew days passed. One day, the tiger was returning from hunting and he saw the rabbit cutting big blocks of wood. He asked the rabbit what he was doing?\n\nThe rabbit said that there were orders that every animal in the jungle has to build an enclosure or fence around themselves for protection. The tiger was surprised and said, \"This is news to me.\"\n\n\"Well, everyone is doing it,\" said the rabbit.\n\nThe tiger got a bit apprehensive and said, \"Please my good friend, won't you help in building me an enclosure?\"\n\nThe rabbit although initially hesitant, but after seeing the tiger's pleas, the rabbit eventually consented.\n\nTherefore, he quickly build a solid, wooden enclosure for the tiger and went away. It was strong and could not easily be penetrated.\n\nThe tiger was inside the barricade and after sometime felt hungry.\n\nSoon a monkey passed that away and he asked the monkey, \"Has the danger passed?\".\n\nAlthough the monkey had the faintest idea what the tiger was asking, he still replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nTherefore, the tiger asked the monkey to let him out of the enclosure.\n\n\"I cannot, as the ropes are tied securely. Ask the one who put you inside to come and let you out,\" said the monkey.\n\nSoon the goat came along, and then the armadillo and other animals and all of them had the same answer.\n\nSoon, the tiger realized that he had been tricked. He tried with all his might to jump over the enclosure, but was unsuccessful. He kept on trying until he was tired. Then, he tried to break down the fence, but that too proved futile. He became very thirsty and hungry. He decided to rest a while.\n\nHe became desperate and thought that he might never get out of there alive.\n\nHe starts hallucinating about food and good spring water. Once more, he decided to give it a try with all his might. He kept on hammering the enclosure, until there was a little gap. He pushed and shoved through the gap and finally broke through. However, he was injured very badly in the process, and got deep gashes and cuts on either side of the body. As a result, to this day, he carries those stripes."

      "body": "Ashputtel:\n\nA rich man's wife became sick, and when she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, \"Dear child, remain pious and good, and then our dear God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you.\" With this she closed her eyes and died.\n\nThe girl went out to her mother's grave every day and wept, and she remained pious and good. When winter came the snow spread a white cloth over the grave, and when the spring sun had removed it again, the man took himself another wife.\n\nThis wife brought two daughters into the house with her. They were beautiful, with fair faces, but evil and dark hearts. Times soon grew very bad for the poor stepchild.\n\n\"Why should that stupid goose sit in the parlor with us?\" they said. \"If she wants to eat bread, then she will have to earn it. Out with this kitchen maid!\"\n\nThey took her beautiful clothes away from her, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes. \"Just look at the proud princess! How decked out she is!\" they shouted and laughed as they led her into the kitchen.\n\nThere she had to do hard work from morning until evening, get up before daybreak, carry water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides this, the sisters did everything imaginable to hurt her. They made fun of her, scattered peas and lentils into the ashes for her, so that she had to sit and pick them out again. In the evening when she had worked herself weary, there was no bed for her. Instead she had to sleep by the hearth in the ashes. And because she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella.\n\nOne day it happened that the father was going to the fair, and he asked his two stepdaughters what he should bring back for them.\n\n\"Beautiful dresses,\" said the one.\n\n\"Pearls and jewels,\" said the other.\n\n\"And you, Cinderella,\" he said, \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"Father, break off for me the first twig that brushes against your hat on your way home.\"\n\nSo he bought beautiful dresses, pearls, and jewels for his two stepdaughters. On his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the twig and took it with him. Arriving home, he gave his stepdaughters the things that they had asked for, and he gave Cinderella the twig from the hazel bush.\n\nCinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave, and planted the branch on it, and she wept so much that her tears fell upon it and watered it. It grew and became a beautiful tree.\n\nCinderella went to this tree three times every day, and beneath it she wept and prayed. A white bird came to the tree every time, and whenever she expressed a wish, the bird would throw down to her what she had wished for.\n\nNow it happened that the king proclaimed a festival that was to last three days. All the beautiful young girls in the land were invited, so that his son could select a bride for himself. When the two stepsisters heard that they too had been invited, they were in high spirits.\n\nThey called Cinderella, saying, \"Comb our hair for us. Brush our shoes and fasten our buckles. We are going to the festival at the king's castle.\"\n\nCinderella obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go to the dance with them. She begged her stepmother to allow her to go.\n\n\"You, Cinderella?\" she said. \"You, all covered with dust and dirt, and you want to go to the festival?. You have neither clothes nor shoes, and yet you want to dance!\"\n\nHowever, because Cinderella kept asking, the stepmother finally said, \"I have scattered a bowl of lentils into the ashes for you. If you can pick them out again in two hours, then you may go with us.\"\n\nThe girl went through the back door into the garden, and called out, \"You tame pigeons, you turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to gather:\n\nThe good ones go into the pot,\nThe bad ones go into your crop.\"\nTwo white pigeons came in through the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and swarming in, and lit around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and began to pick, pick, pick, pick. And the others also began to pick, pick, pick, pick. They gathered all the good grains into the bowl. Hardly one hour had passed before they were finished, and they all flew out again.\nThe girl took the bowl to her stepmother, and was happy, thinking that now she would be allowed to go to the festival with them.\n\nBut the stepmother said, \"No, Cinderella, you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance. Everyone would only laugh at you.\"\n\nCinderella began to cry, and then the stepmother said, \"You may go if you are able to pick two bowls of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour,\" thinking to herself, \"She will never be able to do that.\"\n\nThe girl went through the back door into the garden, and called out, \"You tame pigeons, you turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to gather:\n\nThe good ones go into the pot,\nThe bad ones go into your crop.\"\nTwo white pigeons came in through the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and swarming in, and lit around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and began to pick, pick, pick, pick. And the others also began to pick, pick, pick, pick. They gathered all the good grains into the bowls. Before a half hour had passed they were finished, and they all flew out again.\nThe girl took the bowls to her stepmother, and was happy, thinking that now she would be allowed to go to the festival with them.\n\nBut the stepmother said, \"It's no use. You are not coming with us, for you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance. We would be ashamed of you.\" With this she turned her back on Cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters.\n\nNow that no one else was at home, Cinderella went to her mother's grave beneath the hazel tree, and cried out:\n\nShake and quiver, little tree,\nThrow gold and silver down to me.\nThen the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She quickly put on the dress and went to the festival.\nHer stepsisters and her stepmother did not recognize her. They thought she must be a foreign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought it was Cinderella, for they thought that she was sitting at home in the dirt, looking for lentils in the ashes.\n\nThe prince approached her, took her by the hand, and danced with her. Furthermore, he would dance with no one else. He never let go of her hand, and whenever anyone else came and asked her to dance, he would say, \"She is my dance partner.\"\n\nShe danced until evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the prince said, \"I will go along and escort you,\" for he wanted to see to whom the beautiful girl belonged. However, she eluded him and jumped into the pigeon coop. The prince waited until her father came, and then he told him that the unknown girl had jumped into the pigeon coop.\n\nThe old man thought, \"Could it be Cinderella?\"\n\nHe had them bring him an ax and a pick so that he could break the pigeon coop apart, but no one was inside. When they got home Cinderella was lying in the ashes, dressed in her dirty clothes. A dim little oil-lamp was burning in the fireplace. Cinderella had quickly jumped down from the back of the pigeon coop and had run to the hazel tree. There she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again. Then, dressed in her gray smock, she had returned to the ashes in the kitchen.\n\nThe next day when the festival began anew, and her parents and her stepsisters had gone again, Cinderella went to the hazel tree and said:\n\nShake and quiver, little tree,\nThrow gold and silver down to me.\nThen the bird threw down an even more magnificent dress than on the preceding day. When Cinderella appeared at the festival in this dress, everyone was astonished at her beauty. The prince had waited until she came, then immediately took her by the hand, and danced only with her. When others came and asked her to dance with them, he said, \"She is my dance partner.\"\nWhen evening came she wanted to leave, and the prince followed her, wanting to see into which house she went. But she ran away from him and into the garden behind the house. A beautiful tall tree stood there, on which hung the most magnificent pears. She climbed as nimbly as a squirrel into the branches, and the prince did not know where she had gone. He waited until her father came, then said to him, \"The unknown girl has eluded me, and I believe she has climbed up the pear tree.\n\nThe father thought, \"Could it be Cinderella?\" He had an ax brought to him and cut down the tree, but no one was in it. When they came to the kitchen, Cinderella was lying there in the ashes as usual, for she had jumped down from the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress back to the bird in the hazel tree, and had put on her gray smock.\n\nOn the third day, when her parents and sisters had gone away, Cinderella went again to her mother's grave and said to the tree:\n\nShake and quiver, little tree,\nThrow gold and silver down to me.\nThis time the bird threw down to her a dress that was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were of pure gold. When she arrived at the festival in this dress, everyone was so astonished that they did not know what to say. The prince danced only with her, and whenever anyone else asked her to dance, he would say, \"She is my dance partner.\"\nWhen evening came Cinderella wanted to leave, and the prince tried to escort her, but she ran away from him so quickly that he could not follow her. The prince, however, had set a trap. He had had the entire stairway smeared with pitch. When she ran down the stairs, her left slipper stuck in the pitch. The prince picked it up. It was small and dainty, and of pure gold.\n\nThe next morning, he went with it to the man, and said to him, \"No one shall be my wife except for the one whose foot fits this golden shoe.\"\n\nThe two sisters were happy to hear this, for they had pretty feet. With her mother standing by, the older one took the shoe into her bedroom to try it on. She could not get her big toe into it, for the shoe was too small for her. Then her mother gave her a knife and said, \"Cut off your toe. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot.\"\n\nThe girl cut off her toe, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the prince. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. However, they had to ride past the grave, and there, on the hazel tree, sat the two pigeons, crying out:\n\nRook di goo, rook di goo!\nThere's blood in the shoe.\nThe shoe is too tight,\nThis bride is not right!\nThen he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was running from it. He turned his horse around and took the false bride home again, saying that she was not the right one, and that the other sister should try on the shoe. She went into her bedroom, and got her toes into the shoe all right, but her heel was too large.\nThen her mother gave her a knife, and said, \"Cut a piece off your heel. When you are queen you will no longer have to go on foot.\"\n\nThe girl cut a piece off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the prince. He took her on his horse as his bride and rode away with her. When they passed the hazel tree, the two pigeons were sitting in it, and they cried out:\n\nRook di goo, rook di goo!\nThere's blood in the shoe.\nThe shoe is too tight,\nThis bride is not right!\nHe looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking all red. Then he turned his horse around and took the false bride home again.\n\"This is not the right one, either,\" he said. \"Don't you have another daughter?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man. \"There is only a deformed little Cinderella from my first wife, but she cannot possibly be the bride.\"\n\nThe prince told him to send her to him, but the mother answered, \"Oh, no, she is much too dirty. She cannot be seen.\"\n\nBut the prince insisted on it, and they had to call Cinderella. She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the prince, who gave her the golden shoe. She sat down on a stool, pulled her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, and it fitted her perfectly.\n\nWhen she stood up the prince looked into her face, and he recognized the beautiful girl who had danced with him. He cried out, \"She is my true bride.\"\n\nThe stepmother and the two sisters were horrified and turned pale with anger. The prince, however, took Cinderella onto his horse and rode away with her. As they passed by the hazel tree, the two white pigeons cried out:\n\nRook di goo, rook di goo!\nNo blood's in the shoe.\nThe shoe's not too tight,\nThis bride is right!\nAfter they had cried this out, they both flew down and lit on Cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there.\nWhen the wedding with the prince was to be held, the two false sisters came, wanting to gain favor with Cinderella and to share her good fortune. When the bridal couple walked into the church, the older sister walked on their right side and the younger on their left side, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards, as they came out of the church, the older one was on the left side, and the younger one on the right side, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each of them. And thus, for their wickedness and falsehood, they were punished with blindness as long as they lived."

He was delighted to get a meal with no effort at all.\n\nThe lion was about to spring at the sleeping rabbit when he caught sight of a deer passing by. He thought of going for bigger prey, as it would be a much nicer meal.\n\nSo, he chased the deer but failed to overtake it. He gave up the attempt and returned to the place where the rabbit was sleeping.\n\nReaching there, the lion saw that the small animal was no longer there. As it was getting dark, it was difficult for the lion to look out for another prey and so he had to remain hungry.\n\n“I have been served right. Had I contented myself with the rabbit, I would not have starved at least “, murmured the lion.\n\nWhat we learn from this story is that greed for more causes loss of what one already has.\n\nThe End."

      "body": "The Bad Girl:\n\nSHE was always called the bad girl, for she had once, when she was very little, put out her tongue at the postman. She lived alone with her grandmother and her three brothers in the cottage beyond the field, and the girls in the village took no notice of her. The bad girl did not mind this, for she was always thinking of the cuckoo clock. The clock stood in one corner of the cottage, and every hour a door opened at the top of its face, and a little cuckoo came out and called its name just the same number of times that the clock ought to have struck, and called it so loudly and in so much haste that the clock was afraid to strike at all. The bad girl was always wondering whether it was worse for the clock to have a cupboard in its forehead, and a bird that was always hopping in and out, or for the poor cuckoo to spend so much time in a dark little prison. “If it could only get away to the woods, “ she said to herself, “ who knows but its voice might grow sweet, and even life itself might come to it!\n\n“She thought of the clock so much that her grandmother used to say--\n\n“Ah, lassie, if you would only think of me sometimes! “ But the bad girl would answer--\n\n“You are not in prison, granny dear, and you have not even a bee in your bonnet, let alone a bird in your head. Why should I think of you? “\n\nOne day, close by the farm, she saw the big girls from the school gathering flowers.\n\n“Give me one, “ she said; “perhaps the cuckoo would like it. “ But they all cried, “No, no! “ and tried to frighten her away. “They are for the little one‘s birthday. To-morrow she will be seven years old, “ they said, “ and she is to have a crown of flowers and a cake, and all afternoon we shall play merry games with her. “\n\n“Is she unhappy, that you are taking so much trouble for her? “ asked the bad girl.\n\n“Oh, no; she is very happy: but it will be her birthday, and we want to make her happier. “\n\n“Why? “\n\n“Because we love her, “ said one;\n\n“Because she is so little, “ said another;\n\n“Because she is alive, “ said a third.\n\n“Are all things that live to be loved and cared for? “ the bad girl asked, but they were too busy to listen, so she went on her way thinking, and it seemed as if all things around the birds, and bees, and the rustling leave*, and the little tender wildflowers, half-hidden in the grass answered, as she went along\n\n“Yes, they are all to be cared for and made happier, if it is possible. “\n\n“The cuckoo clock is not alive, “ she thought.\n\n“Oh, no; it is not alive, “ the trees answered; “but many things that do not live have voices, and many others are just sign-posts, pointing the way. “\n\n“The way! The way to what, and where? “\n\n“We find out for ourselves; we must all find out for ourselves, “ the trees sighed and whispered to each other.\n\nAs the bad girl entered the cottage, the cuckoo called out its name eleven times, but she did not even lookup. She walked straight across to the chair by the fireside and kneeling down, kissed her granny‘s hands."

      "body": "The Dog And The Sparrow:\n\nA shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood. On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ’Why are you so sad, my friend?’ ’Because,’ said the dog, ’I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.’ ’If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ’come with me into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, ’Stand there a little while till I peck you down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. \n\nThen the dog snapped it up, and scrambled away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ’Well,’ said the sparrow, ’you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ’Well, my good friend, have you had enough now?’ ’I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ’but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ’Come with me then,’ said the sparrow, ’and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ’Yes,’ said he; ’and now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’\n\n So they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, ’I am very much tired–I should like to take a nap.’ ’Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ’do so, and in the meantime I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, ’Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the carter, grumbling to himself, ’You make it the worse for me, indeed! what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \n\n ’There,’ cried the sparrow, ’thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’ ’Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ’what harm can you do me?’ and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and than all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty. ’What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head with such force, that he fell down dead. \n\n ’Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried he. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ’Miserable wretch that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ’Not wretch enough yet!’ and perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot. ’Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two. ’Alas! miserable wretch that I am!’ cried he. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew away; ’now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’\n\nThe carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation. ’Alas!’ said he to his wife, ’what ill luck has befallen me! –my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.’ ’Alas! husband,’ replied she, ’and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the midst of them. ’Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. ’Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow; ’thy cruelty shall cost thee they life yet!’ and away she flew.\n\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried ’Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window- seat, and cried, ’Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ \n\nThen he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, ’Shall I kill her at once?’ ’No,’ cried he, ’that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, ’Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ’Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest."

      "body": "Jorinda And Jorindel:\n\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.\n\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, ’We must take care that we don’t go too near to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches.\n\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves at a loss to know what path to take.\n\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled. Jorinda was just singing,\n\n ’The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\n  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\n  Well-a-day!’\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with a mournful /jug, jug/. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times round them, and three times screamed:\n\n ’Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.\n\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone– but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice:\n\n ’Till the prisoner is fast,\n  And her doom is cast,\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\n  When the charm is around her,\n  And the spell has bound her,\n  Hie away! away!’\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way.\n\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ’Alas!’ he said, ’what will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\n\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he found his Jorinda again.\n\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle.\n\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door. Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.\n\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s cages by themselves, much longer than they liked."

      "body": "The New Century's Goddess:\n\nThe New Century' s Goddess - whom our great-grandchildren or perhaps a still later generation will know, but we shall not - when and how does she reveal herself? What does she look like? What is the theme of her song? Whose heartstrings will she touch? To what heights will she lift her century?\n\nWhy so many questions, in a busy day like ours, when poetry is very nearly superfluous when it is agreed that the many \"immortal\" productions of today' s poets will, in the future, perhaps exist only in the form of charcoal tracings on a prison wall, seen and read only by a few curiosity seekers?\n\nPoesy is required to serve in the ranks - at least to accept the challenge in party wars, whether it be blood or ink that flows.\n\nBut this is only one-sided talk, many will say; poesy has not been entirely forgotten in our time.\n\nNo, there are still people who, when they are not busy, are conscious of a desire for poetry, and no sooner do they feel that spiritual rumbling in their respective nobler parts than they promptly go to a bookstore and buy four shillings' worth of poetry of the most approved styles. Others take much pleasure from whatever they can get at a bargain; they are contented with reading the scrap that is on the grocer' s wrapping paper; it is much cheaper, and in our busy time we must take notice of that. There is a demand for whatever is supplied, and that is enough! The poetry of the future, as well as the poetry of music, is reckoned with the Don Quixotiana; to speak of it is much like speaking of a voyage of discovery to Uranus.\n\nTime is too short and precious for the mere plays of fantasy, and, to speak seriously for once, what is poetry? These resonant outpourings of feeling and thought, they are only the offspring of nervous vibrations. Enthusiasm, joy, pain, all the movements of the organism, the wise men tell us, are but nerve vibrations. Each of us is but a string instrument.\n\nBut who touches the strings? Who causes them to vibrate into sound? The Spirit, the unseen Heavenly Spirit, who echoes in them His emotion, His feelings; and these are understood by other string instruments, which respond in melting harmonies or clashing dissonances. So it was, and so it will be, in mankind' s mighty onward march in the consciousness of freedom.\n\nEach century, every thousand years, one might even say, has its chief expression in its poetry. Born in the passing era, it comes forth and reigns in the new, succeeding era.\n\nThus she is already born, this Goddess of the New Century, amid the roar of today' s machinery. We send her our greetings! May she hear this, or sometimes read it, perhaps among the charcoal tracings we just mentioned.\n\nThe rocker of her cradle extended from the farthest point reached by the foot of man on polar voyages, as far as the living eye can gaze into the jet depth of the polar sky. We would never hear the rocking for the clatter of engines, the screams of locomotives, the thunder of quarry blasts, and the bursting of the Spirit' old bonds.\n\nShe is born in the vast factory of the present, where steam sets in action its power, and where Master Bloodless and his crew toil night and day.\n\nShe bears the womanly heart of love, the vestal' s flame, and the furnace of passion. Hers is the lightning ray of intellect, in all its endless, shifting, prismatic hues of the ages. Fantasy' s vast, swan feathered tunic is her strength and pride; science wove it; the \"elemental forces\" gave it the power of wing.\n\nOn her father' s side, she is a child of the people, sound in sense and heart, with an earnest eye, and with humor on her lips. Her mother is the highborn, academy-trained emigrant' s daughter, with gilded rococo reminiscences. The Goddess of the New Century has in her the blood and soul of both.\n\nUpon her cradle was laid splendid birthday gifts. Plentiful as bonbons, the occult riddles of nature, with their solutions, are strewn there. The diver' s bell gives mystic souvenirs from the deep. The map of the heavens, that high-hung Pacific Ocean with its countless isles, each a world in itself, is embroidered on the cradle cloth. The sun paints her pictures; photography has given her toys to play with.\n\nThe nurse has sung to her of Eivind Skalde-spiller and Firdausi, of the minnesingers, and what Heine, bold as a boy, sang from his poetic soul. Much, far too much, has the nurse told her; she knows the Edda, the old great-grandmother' s frightful tales, where horrors sweep the air with bloody wings. The whole of the OrientalThousand and One Night she heard in the quarter part of an hour.\n\nThe Goddess of the New Century is still a child, but she has sprung forth from her cradle and is governed by the will, though she still doesn't know what she wants.\n\nShe is still at play in her vast nursery packed with treasures of art and the rococo. Greek tragedy and Roman comedy are carved there in marble. The folk songs of the nations cover the walls like withered vines; a kiss from her, and they blossom forth with freshness and sweet vapor. The mighty tones and thoughts of Beethoven, Mozart, Glück, and the other great masters surround her with eternal chords. On her bookshelves are many laid to rest who in their day were immortal; and there is yet room for many another whose name we hear clicking from the telegraph of immortality but who dies with the telegram.\n\nShe has read an awful lot, far too much, for is she not born in our time? And all too much must again be forgotten, but the Goddess will know how to forget.\n\nShe doesn't think of her song, which will flourish in thousands of years to come, besides the legends of Moses and Bidpai's golden fable about the craft and luck of the fox. She doesn't think of her mission or of her melodious future; she is still playing, while the struggles of nations shake the air and sound figures of pen and cannon rush to and fro - runes of mystic reading.\n\nShe wears a Garibaldi hat, and when she reads her Shakespeare she stops for a moment to think; he can still be played when I am grown! Calderón rests in the tomb of his works, beneath the tablet of his glory. The Goddess is cosmopolitan, for she has bound together Holberg with Molière, Plautus, and Aristophanes; but most she reads her Molière.\n\nShe is free from the turbulence that drives the goats of the Alps, but still, her soul yearns for the salt of life, as the goat's pant for the mountain salt. There is calm in her heart as in the ancient Hebrew songs the voice of the nomad drifts over green pastures beneath starry skies, and yet in song, her heart swells mightier than the heart of the inspired warrior from the Thessalonian mountains in the old days of Greece.\n\nHow goes it with her Christendom? She has learned the ins and outs of philosophy; the elements broke one of her milk teeth, but a new one grew. While yet in the cradle she ate of the fruit of knowledge and grew wise so that Immortality flashed forth before her as mankind' s happiest thought.\n\nWhen begins the New Age of Poesy? When will the Goddess be known? When will she be heard?\n\nOn a wonderful spring morning she will come on the locomotive dragon, thundering over bridges and through dark tunnels; or on the back of the puffing dolphin across the calm but the surging sea; or high in the air, carried by Montgolfier's bird, Roc, descending in the land where first her God-given voice shall greet the race of man. When? Will she come from the newfound land of Columbus, the land of freedom, where the native is hunted and the African is a beast of burden, the land from where we heard The Song of Hiawatha? Or from the antipodes, that golden nugget in the southern sea, the land of opposites, where our nighttime is their daytime, and where the black swans sing in mossy forests? Or maybe from the land where Memnon' s pillar rings but we never understood the song of the Sphinx in the desert from the isle of the coalpit, where, since the age of the great Elizabeth, Shakespeare has reigned? Or from Tycho Brahe's home, where he wasn't wanted; or from California's fairyland, where the redwood holds high its crown as king of the earth' s forests?\n\nWhen shall the star be lit, the star on the brow of the Goddess, the flower on whose petals is inscribed the century's ideal of beauty in form, color, and fragrance?\n\n\"What is the Goddess' new platform?\" inquires the skillful politician of the day. \"What does she stand for?\"\n\nBetter ask what she does not stand for!\n\nShe will not appear as a ghost of bygone times! She will not fashion her dramas from the discarded splendor of the stage, nor cover the lack of dramatic architecture with the dazzling colors of lyric drapery! Her flight forth among us will be as from the car of Thespis to the marble arena. She will not shatter normal human speech to fragments, to be clinked together for an artificial music box with tones from troubadour tournaments. Nor will she separate patrician Verse and plain plebeian Prose - twins are they invoice, quality, and power! Nor will she carve from the saga blocks of Iceland and ancient gods, for they are dead; no sympathy or fellowship awaits them in our day! Nor will she command her generation to occupy their thoughts with the fabric of a French novel; nor will she dull them with the chloroform of everyday history! She will bring the elixir of life; her song, whether in verse or prose, will be brief, clear, and rich. The nations' heartbeats are but letters in the endless alphabet of mankind' s growth; she grasps each letter with equal lovingness, and ranges all in words, and weaves her words into rhythms for her Age' s Hymn.\n\nAnd when shall the hour come?\n\nIt will belong to us who are still here; brief to those who have flown ahead.\n\nThe Chinese Wall will soon fall. The railways of Europe open old Asia' s tightly sealed culture archives, and the opposing streams of human culture meet, mayhap with a thunderous crash. The oldsters of our days will tremble at that sound and hear in it a judgment, the fall of ancient gods, forgetting that times and peoples must pass from the earth, and only a tiny image, sealed in a word casket, remains of each, floating like a lotus flower on the stream of eternity, and telling us that all were flesh of our flesh, dressed in different attire. The Jewish image shines radiantly from the Bible; the Greek from theIliad and the Odyssey; and ours? Ask it of the coming Goddess, at judgment time, when the new heaven is lifted to light and sight at the judgment day.\n\nAll the power of steam and all the pressure of modern times were levers! Master Bloodless and his busy crew, who seem the all-powerful rulers of our day, are but its servants, black slaves to adorn the festive hall, open its treasures, set its tables, for the great feast day when the Goddess, a child of innocence, a maid of inspiration, a matron of calm wisdom, shall lift on high the wonderful Lamp of Poetry, that rich, full human heart flaming with the fire of God.\n\nGreetings, you Goddess of Poetry' s coming age! May our salutation be heard as is heard the worm's hymn of thanksgiving - the worm that is cut to pieces beneath the plow, while a new springtime is dawning and the plowman draws his furrow among us worms, crushing us, that your blessings may be bestowed upon the coming generation."

      "body": "Tom Thumb:\n\nThere was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and poked the fire, and his wife sat and spun. Then said he, \"How sad it is that we have no children. With us all is so quiet, and in other houses it is noisy and lively.\"\n\n\"Yes, replied the wife, and sighed, \"even if we had only one, and it were quite small, and only as big as a thumb, I should be quite satisfied, and we would still love it with all our hearts.\"\n\nNow it so happened that the woman fell ill, and after seven months gave birth to a child, that was perfect in all its limbs, but no longer than a thumb. Then said they, \"It is as we wished it to be, and it shall be our dear child.\" And because of its size, they called it Tom Thumb. Though they did not let it want for food, the child did not grow taller, but remained as it had been at the first. Nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its eyes, and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature, for everything it did turned out well.\n\nOne day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut wood, when he said as if to himself, \"How I wish that there was someone who would bring the cart to me.\"\n\n\"Oh father,\" cried Tom Thumb, \"I will soon bring the cart, rely on that. It shall be in the forest at the appointed time.\"\n\nThe man smiled and said, \"How can that be done? You are far too small to lead the horse by the reins.\"\n\n\"That's of no consequence, father, if my mother will only harness it, I shall sit in the horse's ear and call out to him how he is to go.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered the man, \"for once we will try it.\"\n\nWhen the time came, the mother harnessed the horse, and placed Tom Thumb in its ear, and then the little creature cried, \"Gee up, gee up.\" Then it went quite properly as if with its master, and the cart went the right way into the forest. It so happened that just as he was turning a corner, and the little one was crying, \"gee up,\" two strange men came towards him.\n\n\"My word,\" said one of them, \"what is this? There is a cart coming, and a driver is calling to the horse and still he is not to be seen.\"\n\n\"That can't be right,\" said the other, \"we will follow the cart and see where it stops.\"\n\nThe cart, however, drove right into the forest, and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut. When Tom Thumb saw his father, he cried to him, \"Do you see, Father, here I am with the cart, now take me up.\" The father got hold of the horse with his left hand and with the right took his little son out of the ear. Tom Thumb sat down quite merrily on a straw, but when the two strange men saw him, they did not know what to say for astonishment.\n\nThen one of them took the other aside and said, \"Listen, the little fellow would make our fortune if we exhibited him in a large town, for money. We will buy him.\" They went to the peasant and said, \"Sell us the little man. He shall be well treated with us.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the father, \"he is the apple of my eye, and all the money in the world cannot buy him from me.\"\n\nTom Thumb, however, when he heard of the bargain, had crept up the folds of his father's coat, placed himself on his shoulder, and whispered in his ear, \"Father do give me away, I will soon come back again.\"\n\nThen the father parted with him to the two men for a handsome sum of money. \"Where will you sit?\" they said to him.\n\n\"Oh just set me on the rim of your hat, and then I can walk backwards and forwards and look at the country, and still not fall down.\" They did as he wished, and when Tom Thumb had taken leave of his father, they went away with him. They walked until it was dusk, and then the little fellow said, \"Do take me down, it is necessary.\"\n\n\"Just stay up there,\" said the man on whose hat he sat, \"it makes no difference to me. The birds sometimes let things fall on me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tom Thumb, \"I know what's manners, take me quickly up.\" The man took his hat off, and put the little fellow on the ground by the wayside, and he leapt and crept about a little between the sods, and then he suddenly slipped into a mousehole which he had sought out. \"Good evening, gentlemen, just go home without me,\" he cried to them, and mocked them. They ran thither and stuck their sticks into the mousehole, but it was all in vain. Tom Thumb crept still farther in, and as it soon became quite dark, they were forced to go home with their vexation and their empty purses.\n\nWhen Tom Thumb saw that they were gone, he crept back out of the subterranean passage. \"It is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the dark,\" said he, \"how easily a neck or a leg is broken.\" Fortunately he stumbled against an empty snail-shell. \"Thank God,\" said he, \"in that I can pass the night in safety.\" And got into it.\n\nNot long afterwards, when he was just going to sleep, he heard two men go by, and one of them was saying, \"How shall we set about getting hold of the rich pastor's silver and gold?\"\n\n\"I could tell you that,\" cried Tom Thumb, interrupting them.\n\n\"What was that?\" said one of the thieves in fright, \"I heard someone speaking.\"\n\nThey stood still listening, and Tom Thumb spoke again, and said, \"Take me with you, and I'll help you.\"\n\n\"But where are you?\"\n\n\"Just look on the ground, and observe from whence my voice comes,\" he replied.\n\nThere the thieves at length found him, and lifted him up. \"You little imp, how will you help us?\" they said.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he, \"I will creep into the pastor's room through the iron bars, and will reach out to you whatever you want to have.\"\n\n\"Come then,\" they said, \"and we will see what you can do.\"\n\nWhen they got to the pastor's house, Tom Thumb crept into the room, but instantly cried out with all his might, \"Do you want to have everything that is here?\"\n\nThe thieves were alarmed, and said, \"But do speak softly, so as not to waken any one.\"\n\nTom Thumb however, behaved as if he had not understood this, and cried again, \"What do you want? Do you want to have everything that is here?\"\n\nThe cook, who slept in the next room, heard this and sat up in bed, and listened. The thieves, however, had in their fright run some distance away, but at last they took courage, and thought, \"The little rascal wants to mock us.\" They came back and whispered to him, \"Come be serious, and reach something out to us.\"\n\nThen Tom Thumb again cried as loudly as he could, \"I really will give you everything, just put your hands in.\"\n\nThe maid who was listening, heard this quite distinctly, and jumped out of bed and rushed to the door. The thieves took flight, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, but as the maid could not see anything, she went to strike a light. When she came to the place with it, Tom Thumb, unperceived, betook himself to the granary, and the maid after she had examined every corner and found nothing, lay down in her bed again, and believed that, after all, she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears.\n\nTom Thumb had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful place to sleep in. There he intended to rest until day, and then go home again to his parents. But there were other things in store for him. Truly, there is much worry and affliction in this world. When the day dawned, the maid arose from her bed to feed the cows. Her first walk was into the barn, where she laid hold of an armful of hay, and precisely that very one in which poor Tom Thumb was lying asleep. He, however, was sleeping so soundly that he was aware of nothing, and did not awake until he was in the mouth of the cow, who had picked him up with the hay.\n\n\"Ah, heavens,\" cried he, \"how have I got into the fulling mill.\" But he soon discovered where he was. Then he had to take care not to let himself go between the teeth and be dismembered, but he was subsequently forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay. \"In this little room the windows are forgotten,\" said he, \"and no sun shines in, neither will a candle be brought.\"\n\nHis quarters were especially unpleasing to him, and the worst was that more and more hay was always coming in by the door, and the space grew less and less. When at length in his anguish, he cried as loud as he could, \"Bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder!\"\n\nThe maid was just milking the cow, and when she heard some one speaking, and saw no one, and perceived that it was the same voice that she had heard in the night, she was so terrified that she slipped off her stool, and spilt the milk.\n\nShe ran in great haste to her master, and said, \"Oh heavens, pastor, the cow has been speaking.\"\n\n\"You are mad,\" replied the pastor, but he went himself to the byre to see what was there. Hardly, however had he set his foot inside when Tom Thumb again cried, \"Bring me no more fodder, bring me no more fodder!\"\n\nThen the pastor himself was alarmed, and thought that an evil spirit had gone into the cow, and ordered her to be killed. She was killed, but the stomach, in which Tom Thumb was, was thrown on the dunghill. Tom Thumb had great difficulty in working his way out. However, he succeeded so far as to get some room, but just as he was going to thrust his head out, a new misfortune occurred. A hungry wolf ran thither, and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp.\n\nTom Thumb did not lose courage. \"Perhaps,\" thought he, \"the wolf will listen to what I have got to say.\" And he called to him from out of his belly, \"Dear wolf, I know of a magnificent feast for you.\"\n\n\"Where is it to be had?\" said the wolf.\n\n\"In such and such a house. You must creep into it through the kitchen-sink, and will find cakes, and bacon, and sausages, and as much of them as you can eat.\" And he described to him exactly his father's house.\n\nThe wolf did not require to be told this twice, squeezed himself in at night through the sink, and ate to his heart's content in the larder. When he had eaten his fill, he wanted to go out again, but he had become so big that he could not go out by the same way. Tom Thumb had reckoned on this, and now began to make a violent noise in the wolf's body, and raged and screamed as loudly as he could.\n\n\"Will you be quiet?\" said the wolf, \"you will waken up the people.\"\n\n\"What do I care?\" replied the little fellow, \"you have eaten your fill, and I will make merry likewise.\" And began once more to scream with all his strength.\n\nAt last his father and mother were aroused by it, and ran to the room and looked in through the opening in the door. When they saw that a wolf was inside, they ran away, and the husband fetched his axe, and the wife the scythe.\n\n\"Stay behind,\" said the man, when they entered the room. \"When I have given the blow, if he is not killed by it, you must cut him down and hew his body to pieces.\"\n\nThen Tom Thumb heard his parents, voices and cried, \"Dear father, I am here, I am in the wolf's body.\"\n\nSaid the father, full of joy, \"Thank God, our dear child has found us again.\" And bade the woman take away her scythe, that Tom Thumb might not be hurt with it. After that he raised his arm, and struck the wolf such a blow on his head that he fell down dead, and then they got knives and scissors and cut his body open and drew the little fellow forth.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the father, \"what sorrow we have gone through for your sake.\"\n\n\"Yes father, I have gone about the world a great deal. Thank heaven, I breathe fresh air again.\"\n\n\"Where have you been, then?\"\n\n\"Ah, father, I have been in a mouse's hole, in a cow's belly, and then in a wolf's paunch. Now I will stay with you.\n\n\"And we will not sell you again, no not for all the riches in the world,\" said his parents, and they embraced and kissed their dear Tom Thumb. They gave him to eat and to drink, and had some new clothes made for him, for his own had been spoiled on his journey."

      "body": "The Blue Light:\n\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him: ‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me service for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living, went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to her, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a run-away soldier?\n\n Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch proposed that he should stay one night more.\n\n ‘Tomorrow, you shall only do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention, ‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon the ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away.\n\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands are?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you bid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the first place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry.\n\n When he was above, he said to the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf. ‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only be at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\n\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he come. He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to do?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’ When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin carried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half- shut eyes. When the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed.\n\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told him that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the streets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’ ‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until cock-crow.\n\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think of something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’ replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under the bed.\n\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to him: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ \n\nHis comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no fear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one more pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do not imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has treated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again.\n\n The king was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife."

      "body": "Doctor Knowall:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a poor peasant by the name of Crab who drove two oxen with a load of wood into town where he sold it to a doctor for two thalers. He received his money just as the doctor was sitting down to eat. When the peasant saw how well the doctor ate and drank, his heart took a longing for the same things, and he decided that he would like to have been a doctor. He stood there for a while, and then asked if he too could not become a doctor.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the doctor, \"in no time at all.\"\n\n\"What do I have to do?\" asked the peasant.\n\nFirst of all, buy yourself an ABC-book, one that has a picture of a rooster up front. Second, sell your wagon and your two oxen and buy yourself some clothing and other things that doctors use. Third, have yourself a sign painted with the words 'I am Doctor Know-All' and nail it above the door to your house.\"\n\nThe peasant did everything he was told to do. After he had doctored a little -- but not very much -- some money was stolen from a great and wealthy nobleman. Someone told him about the Doctor Know-All who lived in such and such a village, and who must know where the money had gone. So the nobleman had his carriage hitched up, rode out to the village, and asked him if he were Doctor Know-All.\n\n\"Yes, that I am.\"\n\n\"Then you must come with me and recover my stolen money.\"\n\n\"Yes, but my wife Grete must come along too.\"\n\nThe nobleman agreed and had them take their places in his carriage. They rode away together.\n\nThey arrived at the nobleman's court just at mealtime, and the nobleman invited him to eat.\n\n\"Yes, but include my wife Grete,\" he replied, and the two of them sat down behind the table.\n\nWhen the first servant brought out a platter of fine food the peasant nudged his wife and said, \"Grete, that's the first one,\" meaning the meal's first course.\n\nHowever, the servant thought that he meant, \"That's the first thief,\" and because that is indeed what he was, he took fright, and outside he said to his comrades, \"The doctor knows everything. It's going to go badly for us. He said that I'm the first one.\"\n\nThe second one did not want to go inside at all, but finally he had to, and when he entered, the peasant nudged his wife and said, \"Grete, that's the second one.\"\n\nThis servant took fright as well, and went outside. It did not go any better for the third one. Once again the peasant said, \"Grete, that's the third one.\"\n\nThe fourth one brought in a covered platter, and the nobleman told the doctor that he should demonstrate his art by guessing what it contained. It was crabs. The peasant looked at the platter, and seeing no way out of his dilemma, he said to himself, \"Oh, poor Crab!\"\n\nHearing this, the nobleman called out, \"If he knows that then he must know who has the money as well!\"\n\nThe servant grew very fearful and motioned to the doctor to go outside. There all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money. They offered to give it all to him and a handsome sum in addition, if he would not turn them in. Otherwise they would all hang. They showed him where the money was hidden. The doctor was satisfied with this, and he went back inside and sat down again at the table.\n\n\"My lord,\" he said, \"Now I will look in my book to see where the money is hidden.\n\nHowever, the fifth servant climbed into the stove in order to hear if the doctor knew anything else. The doctor leafed back and forth in his book looking for the picture of the rooster. Not finding it, he said, \"I know that you are in there. Come on out.\"\n\nThe man in the stove thought that the doctor was talking to him, and terrified, he jumped out, saying, \"The man knows everything!\"\n\nThen Doctor Know-All showed the nobleman where the money was, but he did not tell who had stolen it. Thus he received a large reward from each side and became a famous man."

      "body": "The Brave Tin Soldier:\n\nThere were once twenty-five tin soldiers. They were brothers, for they had all been made out of the same old tin spoon. They all held their rifles against their shoulders, stood upright, and looked straight ahead. Their uniforms were very smart-looking—red and blue—and very splendid. The first thing they heard in the world, when the lid was taken off the box in which they lay, was the words “Tin soldiers!” These words were spoken by a little boy, who clapped his hands for joy. The soldiers had been given him because it was his birthday, and now he was putting them out upon the table.\n\nAll of them were exactly the same, except one who only had one leg. He had been made last of all, and there had not been quite enough tin left to finish him. But he stood as firmly on his one leg as the others upon their two, and it is his story that we will hear about.\n\nOn the table where the tin soldiers had been set up were some other toys, but the one that was most popular was a pretty little paper castle. Through its tiny windows you could see straight into the hall. In front of the castle stood little trees around a small mirror which was meant to be the lake. Little toy swans swam on it, in which you could see their reflections.\n\nAll this was very pretty, but prettiest of all was a little lady who stood at the castle’s open door. She too was cut out of paper, but she wore a lovely dress and a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders, like a scarf, and in the middle of the ribbon was a shining tinsel rose. The little lady stretched out both her arms, for she was a dancer, and then she lifted one leg so high that the Soldier quite lost sight of it. He thought that she had only one leg as well.\n\nThat would be just the wife for me, he thought, if she wasn’t so grand. But she lives in a castle, while I have only a box, and there are twenty-five of us in that. It would be no place for a lady. Still, I must try to meet her. He lay down behind a snuffbox on the table and from here he could easily watch the dainty little lady, who still remained standing on one leg without losing her balance.\n\nWhen the evening came all the other tin soldiers were put away in their box, and the people in the house went to bed. Now it was time for the toys to begin to play. They visited each other, sometimes had fights, and gave balls. The tin soldiers rattled in the box, for they wanted to join the rest, but they could not lift the lid of their box. The nutcrackers did somersaults, and the pencil jumped about in a funny way. They made such a noise that the canary woke and began to speak. The only ones who did not move from their places were our little tin soldier and the lady dancer. She stood on tiptoe with outstretched arms, and he never once turned away his eyes from her.\n\nThe clock struck twelve o’clock struck when suddenly there was a crash. Up sprang the lid of the box the soldier was hiding behind. Out popped a goblin, for the box was a jack-in-the-box.\n\n“Tin soldier,” said the Goblin, “keep your eyes to yourself. Do not look at something nothing to do with you.”\n\nBut the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear.\n\n“Only wait, then, till to-morrow,” remarked the Goblin.\n\nNext morning, when the children got up, the tin soldier was placed on the window sill, and, whether it was the Goblin or the wind that did it, all at once the window flew open and the tin soldier fell head first out of it to the street below. It was a big fall! Over and over he turned in the air, till at last he landed, his cap and rifle stuck between the paving stones, while his one leg stood upright in the air.\n\nSailing down the gutter\n\nThe little boy came down at once to look for him, but could not find him. If the soldier had called “Here I am!” he might easily enough have heard him, but he did not think it was right to cry out for help, as he was supposed to be a brave soldier.\n\nIt now began to rain. Faster and faster fell the drops, until there was a heavy shower and when it was over, two street boys came by.\n\n“Look you,” said one, “there’s a tin soldier. He must come out and sail in a boat.”\n\nSo they made a boat out of an old newspaper and put the tin soldier in the middle of it, and away he sailed down the gutter, while the boys ran along by his side, clapping their hands.\n\nGoodness! How the waves rocked that paper boat, and how fast the stream ran! The tin soldier became quite giddy, the boat moved around so quickly. Still he did not move an inch, but looked straight ahead and held his rifle tightly.\n\nAll at once the boat went into a drain, and it became dark. Where am I going now? he thought. Yes, the Goblin did this to me. If only the little lady was sailing with me in the boat, I would not care if it was twice as dark.\n\nJust then a great water rat, that lived under the drain, suddenly darted out.\n\n“Have you a passport?” asked the rat. “Where is your passport?”\n\nBut the tin soldier kept silence and only held his rifle with a firmer grasp.\n\nThe boat sailed on, but the rat followed, gnashing his teeth and crying out “Stop him! Stop him! He hasn’t paid toll! He hasn’t shown his passport!”\n\nBut the stream grew stronger and stronger. Already the tin soldier could see daylight at the point where the tunnel ended. At the same time he heard a rushing, roaring noise, which would have even made a braver man scared. Where the tunnel ended, the drain widened and fell into the mouth of a sewer. It was as dangerous for the soldier as sailing down a big waterfall would be for us.\n\nHe was now so near it that he couldn’t stop. The boat dashed on, and the tin soldier held himself so well that he didn’t even wink an eye. Three or four times the boat whirled round and round. It was full of water to the brim and was about to sink.\n\nThe tin soldier stood up to his neck in water; deeper and deeper sank the boat, softer and softer grew the paper; and now the water closed over the Soldier’s head. He thought of the pretty little dancer he would never see again, and in his ears he heard the words of the song:\n\nWild adventure, full of danger,\n\nTake it on, brave young stranger.\n\nThe paper boat parted in the middle, and the soldier was about to sink, when he was swallowed by a great fish.\n\nOh, how dark it was! Darker even than in the drain, and so narrow, but the tin soldier remained brave. There he lay inside the fish, shouldering his rifle as before.\n\nTo and fro swam the fish, turning and twisting and making the strangest movements, till at last he became perfectly still.\n\nSuddenly he saw a flash of light and a voice said, “Tin soldier!” The fish had been caught, taken to market, sold and bought, and taken to the kitchen, where the cook had cut him with a large knife. She seized the tin soldier between her finger and thumb and took him to the room where the family sat, and where everyone wanted to see the man who had traveled in the stomach of a fish. But the tin soldier didn’t feel proud, was not at all big-headed.\n\nThey put him on the table. But how could so curious a thing happen? The soldier was back in the very same room he had been before. He saw the same children, the same toys stood on the table, and among them the pretty dancing lady, who still stood upon one leg. She too was always the same, never changing. That touched the tin soldier’s heart. He could have wept tin tears, but that would not have been right. He looked at her and she looked at him, but neither spoke a word. But he could feel warm, loving glow coming from her and thought that his heart might burst.\n\nAnd now one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and threw him into the stove. He gave no reason for doing it, but no doubt the Goblin had something to do with it.\n\nThe tin soldier stood now in a blaze of red light. It was so hot, but he didn’t know if it came from the fire or from the love in his heart. He saw that the colours were gone from his uniform, but whether that had happened on the journey or not, no one could say. He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and he felt himself melting. Still he stood firm as ever, with his rifle on his shoulder. Then suddenly the door flew open. The wind caught the dancer, and she flew straight into the stove to the tin soldier. She wrapped around him and they merged together as they melted and burned. Never had the little soldier felt so happy.\n\nThe next day the maid was cleaning out the ashes of the stove. She found the soldier, melted now into the shape of a little tin heart wrapped around the dancer’s tinsel rose. The maid liked it very much, she thought it looked so pretty. She had it put onto a chain and from then on always wore it around her neck."

      "body": "Fairy Tales - Blondine Lost:\n\nBLONDINE grew to be seven years old and Brunette three.\n\nThe king had given Blondine a charming little carnage drawn by ostriches, and a little coachman ten years of age, who was the nephew of her nurse.\n\nThe little page, who was called Gourmandinet, loved Blondine tenderly. He had been her playmate from birth and she had shown him a thousand acts of kindness.\n\nBut Gourmandinet had one terrible fault; he was a gourmand so fond of dainties and sweet things, that for a paper of bonbons he would commit almost any wicked action. Blondine often said to him:\n\n“I love you dearly, Gourmandinet, but I do not love to see you so greedy. I entreat you to correct this villainous fault which will make you despised by all the world. “\n\nGourmandinet kissed her hand and promised to reform. But, alas! he continued to steal cakes from the kitchen and bonbons from the store-room. Often, indeed, he was whipped for his disobedience and gluttony.\n\nThe queen Fourbette heard on every hand the reproaches lavished upon the page and she was cunning enough to think that she might make use of this weakness of Gourmandinet and thus get rid of poor Blondine.\n\nThe garden in which Blondine drove in her little carriage, drawn by ostriches and guided by her little coachman, Gourmandinet, was separated by a grating from an immense and magnificent forest, called the Forest of Lilacs because during the whole year these lilacs were always covered with superb flowers.\n\nNo one, however, entered these woods. It was well known that it was enchanted ground and that if you once entered there you could never hope to escape.\n\nGourmandinet knew the terrible secret of this forest. He had been severely forbidden ever to drive the carriage of Blondine in that direction lest by some chance Blondine might pass the grating and place her little feet on the enchanted ground.\n\nMany times the king Benin had sought to build a wall the entire length of the grating or to secure it in some way so as to make an entrance there impossible. But the workmen had no sooner laid the foundation than some unknown and invisible power raised the stones and they disappeared from sight.\n\nThe queen Fourbette now sought diligently to gain the friendship of Gourmandinet by giving him every day some delicious dainties. In this way, she made him so complete a slave to his appetite that he could not live without the jellies, bonbons, and cakes which she gave him in such profusion. At last, she sent for him to come to her, and said:\n\n“Gourmandinet, it depends entirely upon yourself whether you shall have a large trunk full of bonbons and delicious dainties or never again eat one during your life. “\n\n“Never again eat one! Oh! Madam, I should die of such punishment. Speak, madam, what must I do to escape this terrible fate? “\n\n“It is necessary, “ said the queen, looking at him fixedly, “that you should drive the princess Blondine near to the Forest of Lilacs. “\n\n“I cannot do it, madam; the king has forbidden it. “\n\n“Ah! you cannot do it; well, then, adieu. No more dainties for you. I shall command everyone in the house to give you nothing. “\n\n“Oh! madam, “ said Gourmandinet, weeping bitterly, “do not be so cruel. Give me some order which is in my power to execute. “\n\n“I can only repeat that I command you to lead the princess Blondine near to the Forest of Lilacs; that you encourage her to descend from the carriage, to cross the grating and enter the enchanted ground. “\n\n“But, madam, “ replied Gourmandinet, turning very pale, “if the princess enters this forest she can never escape from it. You know the penalty of entering upon the enchanted ground. To send ray dear princess there is to give her up to certain death. “\n\n“For the third and last time, “ said the queen, frowning fearfully, “I ask if you will take the princess to the forest? Choose! either an immense box of bonbons that I will renew every month or never again to taste the delicacies that you love. “\n\n“But how shall I escape from the dreadful punishment which his majesty will inflict upon me? “\n\n“Do not be disquieted on that account. As soon as you have induced Blondine to enter the Forest of Lilacs, return to me. I will send you out of danger with your bonbons, and I will charge myself with your future fortune. “\n\n“Oh! Madam, have pity upon me. Do not compel me to lead my dear princess to destruction. She has always been so good to me! “\n\n“You still hesitate, miserable coward! Of what importance is the fate of Blondine to you? When you have obeyed my commands I will see that you enter the service of Brunette and I declare to you solemnly that the bonbons shall never fail. “\n\nGourmandinet hesitated and reflected a few moments longer and, alas! at last, resolved to sacrifice his good little mistress for his gluttony.\n\nThe remainder of that day he still hesitated and he lay awake all night weeping bitter tears as he endeavored to discover some way to escape from the power of the wicked queen; but the certainty of the queen‘s bitter revenge if he refused to execute her cruel orders, and the hope of rescuing Blondine at some future day by seeking the aid of some powerful fairy, conquered his irresolution and decided him to obey the queen.\n\nIn the morning at ten o‘clock, Blondine ordered her little carriage and entered it for a drive, after having embraced the king her father and promised him to return in two hours.\n\nThe garden was immense. Gourmandinet, on the start, turned the ostriches away from the Forest of Lilacs. When, however, they were entirely out of sight of the palace, he changed his course and turned towards the grating which separated them from the enchanted ground. He was sad and silent. His crime weighed upon his heart and conscience.\n\n“What is the matter? “ said Blondine, kindly. “You say nothing. Are you ill, Gourmandinet? “\n\n“No, my princess, I am well. “\n\n“But how pale you are! Tell me what distresses you, poor boy, and I promise to do all in my power to make you happy. “\n\nBlondine‘s kind inquiries and attention almost softened the hard heart of Gourmandinet, but the remembrance of the bonbons promised by the wicked queen, Fourbette, soon chased away his good resolutions. Before he had time to reply, the ostriches reached the grating of the Forest of Lilacs.\n\n“Oh! the beautiful lilacs! “ exclaimed Blondine; “how fragrant how delicious! I must have a bouquet of those beautiful flowers for my good papa. Get down, Gourmandinet and bring me some of those superb branches. “\n\n“I cannot leave my seat, princess, the ostriches might run away with you during my absence. “\n\n“Do not fear, “ replied Blondine; “I could guide them myself to the palace. “\n\n“But the king would give me a terrible scolding for having abandoned you, princess.\n\nIt is best that you go and gather your flowers. “\n\n“That is true. I should be very sorry to get you a scolding, my poor Gourmandinet. “\n\nWhile saying these words she sprang lightly from the carriage, crossed the bars of the grating and commenced to gather the flowers.\n\nAt this moment Gourmandinet shuddered and was overwhelmed with remorse. He wished to repair his fault by calling Blondine but although she was only ten steps from him, although he saw her perfectly she could not hear his voice, and in a short time she was lost to view in the enchanted forest.\n\nFor a long time, Gourmandinet wept over his crime, cursed his gluttony and despised the wicked queen Fourbette.\n\nAt last, he recalled to himself that the hour approached at which Blondine would be expected at the palace. He returned to the stables through the back entrance and ran at once to the queen, who was anxiously expecting him.\n\nOn seeing him so deadly pale and his eyes inflamed from the tears of awful remorse, she knew that Blondine had perished.\n\n“Is it done? “ said she.\n\nGourmandinet bowed his head. He had not the strength to speak.\n\n“Come, “ said she, “behold your reward! “\n\nShe pointed to a large box full of delicious bonbons of every variety. She commanded a valet to raise the box and place it upon one of the mules which had brought her jewelry.\n\n“I confide this box to Gourmandinet, in order that he may take it to my father, “ she said. “Go, boy, and return in a month for another. “ She placed in his hand at the same time a purse full of gold.\n\nGourmandinet mounted the mule in perfect silence and set off in a full gallop. The mule was obstinate and wilful and soon grew restive under the weight of the box and began to prance and kick. He did this so effectively that he threw Gourmandinet and his precious box of bonbons upon the ground.\n\nGourmandinet, who had never ridden upon a horse or mule, fell heavily with his head upon the stones and died instantly.\n\nThus he did not receive from his crime the profit which he had hoped, for he had not even tasted of the bonbons which the queen had given him.\n\nNo one regretted him. No one but the poor Blondine had ever loved him."

The boy used to play with the tree, climb the branches, sleep under the shadow, pluck apples, etc. Every day he visited the tree and ate apples. The apple tree was so kind to the boy and enjoyed spending time with the little boy.\n\nThe boy joined the school and could not spend any time with the apple tree. After several months the boy came to the apple tree. The tree was so happy to see the boy and asked him to play with it.\n\nThe boy said that he was not a little one to play with the trees. But he had another request to the tree.\n\nThe tree asked what he wanted. The boy said that he needed toys to play, but his parents did not have sufficient money to buy toys for him.\n\nThe tree replied, ‘Dear boy, I do not have any money to buy toys for you, but you can pick the apples, sell them, get money and buy the toys you need.‘\n\nThe apple tree was eagerly waiting to see the boy return. The boy went happily after plucking apples, but never returned for several years.\n\nThe tree was so sad and it did not produce any apples thereafter.\n\nAfter almost 10 years, the boy returned to the apple tree as a youngster. The apple tree immediately recognized the boy and was happy to see him. The tree asked him to play again.\n\nThe boy said, ‘I‘m sorry I don‘t have time to play with you as I have to work. We are building a new home and need some wood for it. Can you please help me?\n\nThe apple tree replied, ‘Oh my dear boy, please cut my branches and get the needed quantity of wood, as much as you want.‘\n\nThe boy started to cut the branches of the tree and left the place. After several years, the boy returned as a middle-aged man to the tree. The tree, which was waiting for years to see the boy, was quite delighted.\n\nThe apple tree asked, ‘Can you play with me now?‘\n\nThe boy, who is now an aged man replied, ‘I‘m old now and I want to relax from heavy work. I need a boat to sail to various places. Can you help me?‘\n\nThe apple tree replied, ‘Oh my dear boy, I don‘t have a boat for you, but you can cut my trunk and make a boat.‘\n\nThe man cut the trunk of the tree and made the boat. He happily sailed to various places but never returned to the tree again, which now has only the roots!\n\nAfter two decades, the boy returned to the tree as an old man.\n\nThe tree recognized him and told, ‘Oh my dear boy, now I have nothing to give to you!‘\n\nThe old man said, ‘I just need rest, just give me a place‘\n\nThe apple tree, ‘Come on my dear, take rest in my roots! Good old roots are the best place to have peace and rest!‘\n\nThe man smiled with tears!\n\nThis is a life story of every individual. When we are young, we need the support of the parents. As we grow old, we ignore them and never care for them, but seek help from parents only when we need any help! Finally, when we become parents and age, we understand how great the parents are! Whatever may be the condition, parents are always ready to help their children."

Suddenly he caught sight of a big tree with a hole in it.\n\nInside the hole was a package. The hungry fox immediately thought that there might be food in it, and he became very happy.

Since his kids were growing, he and his wife wanted to renovate it.\n\nThey decided to break and open their living room wall. Initially, when Raj bought his house, wooden walls were used as a part of interior decorations. He decided to remove the wooden walls. The wooden walls were removed and he was shocked to see a lizard stuck in the hollow space between the walls.\n\nHe was greatly surprised and wondered how the lizard was there because the wooden wall was completely sealed and there was no room to move behind the walls. He saw that lizard‘s feet were struck by a nail, which was hammered from outside.\n\nRaj and his family were really amazed seeing the lizard behind the wooden wall and felt too bad for it. Mrs. Raj reminded him that they hammered a nail to hang their kid‘s photo. However, they all had a question about how the lizard survived for up to now without moving from the place.\n\nThe family decided to wait for some time and see the magic of how the lizard with a nail stuck on its feet survived for several months without moving. The obvious question is how the lizard survived without food as it could not move.\n\nWhile they were arranging other things, they had an eye on another lizard. Raj‘s son shouted for a while, ‘Dad look here!‘\n\nAnother lizard appeared carrying the food in his mouth. Yeah, that was a real surprise. The lizard fed food to the one stuck in the wall. This act was so heart touching and everyone was so amazed at the lizard for feeding the stuck one for a long time without getting tired. Both lizards carried the hope of surviving all odds and emerging from a difficult situation.\n\nBoth lizards had never-ending hope for each other and carried a heart full of love and care. The little creature is blessed to carry such a wonderful heart and brilliance. Why not we the human beings, mammals with six senses and bestowed with luxuries of life, carry love and care in our hearts, rather than hatred?\n\nMoral - Share love, care well. Sharing is caring."

      "body": "The Swallows:\n\nTHERE were some children in the north looking at the swallows flying south. “Why are they going away? “ the little one asked.\n\n“The summer is over, “ the elder sister answered, “and if they stayed here they would be starved and die of cold, and so when the summer goes, they journey south. “\n\n“Our mother and sisters are in the south, “ the little one said, as they looked after the birds. “Dear little swallows, tell mother that we are watching for her! “ But they were already flying over the sea. The chilly winds tried to follow, but the swallows flew so swiftly they were not overtaken; they went on, with the summer always before them. They were tired many a time; once they stayed to rest upon the French coast, and once, in the Bay of Biscay, they clung to the rigging of a ship all through the night, but in the morning they went on again.\n\nFar away in the south, two English children were looking from the turret window of an old castle.\n\n“Here are the swallows, “ they said; “perhaps they have come from England. Dear swallows, have you brought us a message? “ they asked.\n\n“It was very cold, we had no time for messages, and we must not lose the track of summer, “ the swallows twittered, and they flew on till they reached the African shore.\n\n“Poor little swallows, “ said the English children, as they watched the ship come into a port that was to take them back to their own land; “they have to chase the summer and the sun, but we do not mind whether it is summer or winter, for if we only keep our hearts warm, the rest does not matter. “\n\n“It is very good of the swallows to come to us, “ the elder sister said, in the next spring, when she heard their first soft twitter beneath the eaves, “for the summer is in many places, and we are so far from the south. “\n\n“Yes, it is very good of them to come, “ the children answered; “dear little swallows, perhaps they love us! “"

      "body": "The Wooden Doll:\n\nTHE wooden doll had no peace. My dears, if ever you are a doll, hope to be a rag doll, or a wax doll, or a doll full of sawdust apt to ooze out, or a china doll easy to break anything in the world rather than a good strong wooden doll with a painted head and movable joints, for that is indeed a sad thing to be. Many a time the poor wooden doll wished it was a tin train, or a box of soldiers, or a woolly lamb, or anything on earth rather than what it was.\n\nIt never had any peace; it was taken up and put down at all manners of odd moments, made to go to bed when the children went to bed, to get up when they got up, be bathed when they were bathed, dressed when they were dressed, taken out in all weathers, stuffed into their satchels when they went to school, left about in corners, dropped on stairs, forgotten, neglected, bumped, banged, broken, glued together, anything and everything it suffered, until many a time it said sadly enough to its poor little self, “ I might as well be a human being at once and be done with it!\n\n“ And then it fell to thinking about human beings; what strange creatures they were, always going about, though none carried them to save when they were very little; always sleeping and waking, and eating and di inking, and laughing and crying, and talking and walking, and doing this and that and the other, never resting for long together, or seeming as if they could be still for even a single day.\n\n“ They are always making a noise, “ thought the wooden doll; “ they are always talking and walking about, always moving things and doing things, building up and pulling down, and making and unmaking forever and forever, and never are they quiet. It is lucky that we are not all human beings, or the world would be worn out in no time, and there would not be a corner left in which to rest a poor doll‘s head."

      "body": "A Legend of the Marmara:\n\nDeep within the forest there lives the tallest of all trees. They stretch their thick branches full of leaves up into the blue skies and give us oxygen to breathe. Their trunks are very wide and many of these beautiful giants have been in the forest for hundreds of years. These mighty trees are known as Marmara (known as Lapuna in Spanish) and there are many stories that claim the Marmara possess a spirit that protects the forest. \n\nOne such story was told by an old man whose name was Adao. One day, a very long time ago, Adao and his two young friends decided that they would earn their money by cutting down trees in the forest and selling the lumber to local farmers and builders. The three friends built a small cabin in the forest and set out one morning to cut down their first tree. \n\nOne tree provided enough lumber for the three men to make an honest living for the whole month. The farmers were happy and so were the builders. And for every tree they chopped down the three friends planted two baby samplings that would one day grow into mighty Mafomeira. ‘This is how we keep the forest healthy and happy,’ Adao would say with a smile each time he planted a sapling in the earth. ‘And if we take care of the forest then the forest will take care of us.’ Planting the saplingsAdao and his friends were happy in the forest. They loved their simple cabin and they enjoyed their labours. \n\nThey only ever cut down one Marmara tree each month and they always made sure to plant the baby samplings in order to show respect for the forest. But then, almost without Adao noticing, things started to change. Adao’s friends began to look at the trees in a different way. One asked, ‘Why is it that we only cut a single tree each month when we could be cutting many more?’ ‘We could earn ourselves a great deal of money if we cut down more trees,’ said the other. Adao was very distressed to hear his friends talking in such a way because he respected the forest and did not want to cut down more trees than were needed. But his friends were not to be dissuaded and so they collected their savings and bought a big tractor and more cutting equipment. \n\nThey set out into the forest with their new equipment and began cutting down tree after tree. The mighty trunks fell to the ground one after another and as the forest filled with the crashing and tearing sound of the Lupuna trees Adao’s heart filled with sadness. \n\n'What are you doing, my friends?’ he asked. ‘We must not disrespect the forest in such a way.’ But the two friends would not listen; instead they chopped and stripped the trees and loaded them onto the tractor one after the other. All they could think about was money; they did not care about the forest anymore. The two friends became so skilled at chopping down the mighty Marmara trees that very soon Adao was unable to replace the fallen trees with enough saplings.\n\n He knew that what his friends were doing was wrong but he was unable to stop them because they were blinded by greed. He was sure that he was alone in his quest to prevent the forest from being disrespected and he was fast losing all heart. But he was not alone. The spirit of La Marmara was watching and listening, and the spirit was very angry that the trees were being cut down in such a disrespectful way.\n\n That night, as Adao lay awake in his cot in the little cabin, he heard the mighty trees stirring in the forest and was sure he felt a strange presence all around. On the breeze he could make out words whispered into the night. ‘You shall not treat the forest in such a way. You shall not go unpunished. I am the spirit of the Marmara and I am here to protect and preserve the trees and animals.’ The next day things did not go as planned for Adao’s friends. Both men awoke to a terrible pain in their stomachs and nothing they did seemed to ease the pain. \n \n Despite their discomfort, greed pulled both men from their cots and made sure that they collected the cutting equipment and prepared for the day ahead. But then the tractor would not start. ‘I do not care about the tractor,’ said one. ‘I am still cutting down trees today.’ ‘And I do not care about the pain in my stomach,’ said the other as he grabbed his axe and made ready to cut down the Marmara tree nearest to him. Poor Adao pleaded with his friends to stop what they were doing and spend the day planting saplings in the forest, but neither man would listen. \n \n Just as they raised their axes a mighty wind blew through the forest. The Marmara trees swayed and creaked and moaned in the wind and very soon a heavy rain began to fall. The wind and the rain destroyed the cabin and overturned the tractor. Then one of the friends dropped his axe and cut his leg very badly. The wind grew stronger and stronger until there was nothing left of the cabin at all but a few torn planks. \n \n The tractor was washed away as a nearby river broke its banks and it was then that Adao’s friends suddenly grew very scared. ‘We must run from here!’ they screamed. ‘The forest has destroyed all of our equipment and there is nothing left!’ Then the two friends ran out of the forest as fast as they could and never returned again.Despite fearing for his life Adao stayed where he was and allowed the winds to push him and the rains to fall on him and soak his clothes to his skin until he was cold and battered and bruised. ‘I will not leave the forest!’ he cried out at the top of his voice. ‘I will stay and plant new saplings to replace the trees that my greedy friends chopped down! I shall stay and do this until I die and nothing will change my mind!’ \n \n Then, all of a sudden, the winds died down and the rains came to an abrupt stop. The clouds cleared and the sun came out and dried up the forest floor. Adao was very grateful the storm was over, and as soon as he recovered his wits and dried his clothes he set about planting new saplings in the earth. He worked hard all day and sang to himself the whole time. \n\nHe planted many saplings and each time he did so he prayed that the sapling would grow into a mighty Marmara tree. All day and all night Adao worked in the forest planting his saplings until he was too tired and too hungry to work any longer. He grew afraid because he was exhausted and in need of food and shelter and remembered sadly how the cabin was destroyed by the storm. But when he returned to the clearing he was amazed to find his little cabin standing there unharmed, a small fire in the hearth and a modest meal on the table. Adao knew then that the spirit of the Marmara had created the storm just as it had returned his cabin to him. \n\nThe kind man sat down to his dinner and looked into the fire with watery eyes. ‘I shall continue to plant new saplings here until I am no more,’ he vowed to himself. ‘And I shall only ever cut down a single Marmara tree each month because that is all that is needed.’ And that is exactly what he did. They say that Adao lived for almost one hundred years and that he took his last breath in the forest.\n\n They say that his spirit joined the Marmara just as all others who have passed away in the forest have joined the spirit of the Marmara and help to protect the beautiful forest from all those who would disrespect the trees and the animals within. That is the legend of the Marmara and that is why it is important to preserve and respect the forests of the world."

      "body": "The Straw, The Coal, And The Bean:\n\nA Brothers Grimm fable about how beans came to have a black seam!\n\nIn a village lived a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her seeing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two.\n\nThen the straw began and said:\n\n‘Dear friends, where do you come from?’\n\nThe coal replied:\n\n‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain,—I should have been burnt to ashes.’\n\nThe bean said:\n\n‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’\n\n‘And would a better fate have befallen me?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has destroyed all my brothers and sisters in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\n\n‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.\n\n‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together as good friends, and because a new trouble might find us here, we should go away together to a foreign country.’\n\nThe idea pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over it.\n\nThe straw hit on a good idea, and said:\n\n‘I will lay myself straight across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’\n\nThe straw therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal, who was brave, but still glowing from the fire, tripped quite boldly on to the newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.\n\nThe straw, however, began to burn, broke in two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed when she got into the water, and breathed her last.\n\nThe bean, who had prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event, was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst.\n\nIt would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam."

      "body": "Fairy Tales - Blondine:\n\nTHERE was once a king called Benin. He was good and all the world loved him; he was just and the wicked feared him. His wife, Queen Doucette, was also good, and very beloved.\n\nThis happy pair had a daughter called the Princess Blondine, because of her superb fair hair, and she was as amiable and charming as her father the king and her mother the queen.\n\nUnfortunately, the poor queen died a short time after the birth of Blondine and for a long time, the king wept bitterly at his great loss. Blondine was too young to understand her mother‘s death: she did not weep but continued to laugh, to play and to sleep peacefully. The king loved her tenderly and she loved him more than all the world. He gave his little daughter the most beautiful jewels, the finest bonbons, and the rarest and delicious fruits. Blondine was very happy.\n\nOne day it was announced to the king, that all his subjects demanded that he should marry again in order to have a son who should reign after him. He refused at first but finally yielded to the pressing desires of his people and said to his minister Leger:\n\n“My dear friend, my subjects wish me to marry again but my heart is so sad because of the death of my cherished queen Doucette that I cannot undertake the task of seeking another wife. Go, then, my good Leger and find me a princess who will make my sweet Blondine happy. Go; I ask for nothing more. When you have found a perfect woman, you will demand her hand in marriage and conduct her to my court. “\n\nLeger set off immediately, visited many courts and saw innumerable princesses ugly, humpbacked and wicked.\n\nAt last, he arrived at the kingdom of the monarch Turbulent, who had a lovely daughter, bright, winning and apparently good. Leger found her so charming that he asked for her hand in marriage for his king Benin, without sufficiently inquiring into her real character.\n\nTurbulent was enchanted at the prospect of getting rid of his daughter who was jealous, proud and wicked. Also, her presence often interfered with his excursions for pleasure, with the chase and with his various entertainments at the palace.\n\nWithout a moment‘s hesitation, he acceded to the Prime Minister‘s request, and he returned with the princess to the kingdom of the good king Benin.\n\nPrincess Fourbette was accompanied by four thousand mules, loaded with the jewels and wardrobe of the charming bride.\n\nKing Benin had been apprised of their approach by a courier and went forward to receive the princess Fourbette. He found her beautiful but he noted the absence of the mild and attractive expression of the poor lost Doucette.\n\nWhen Fourbette‘s eyes fell upon Blondine her glance was so cruel, so wicked, that the poor child, who was now three years old, was greatly terrified and began to weep bitterly.\n\n“What is the matter? “ said the king. “Why does my sweet and sensible Blondine weep like a bad little girl? “\n\n“Papa! dear papa! “ cried Blondine, throwing herself into the arms of the king, “do not give me into the hands of this princess. I am afraid her eyes are cruel! “\n\nThe king was very surprised. He turned so suddenly towards the princess Fourbette that she had no time to control herself and he perceived the terrible glance with which she regarded the little Blondine.\n\nBenin immediately resolved that Blondine should be wholly separated from the new queen and remain as before under the exclusive protection of the nurse who had taken care of her and who loved her tenderly.\n\nThe queen thus saw Blondine rarely, and when she met her by chance she could not wholly dissimulate the hatred she felt for her.\n\nAbout a year from that time a daughter was born to queen Fourbette. She was named Brunette, because of her dark hair which was as black as the raven‘s wing.\n\nThe brunette was pretty but not so lovely as Blondine; moreover, she was as wicked as her mother. She detested Blondine and played all sorts of cruel tricks upon her, bit her, pinched her, pulled her hair, broke her toys and tore her beautiful dresses.\n\nThe good little Blondine was never in a passion with her sister but always tried to make excuses for her conduct.\n\n“Oh, papa! “ she said to the king, “do not scold Brunette; she is so little! she does not know that she grieves me when she breaks my toys! It is only in play that she bites me, pulls my hair and pinches me. “\n\nThe good king embraced his little daughter and was silent but he knew that Brunette was cruel and wicked; that Blondine was too gentle and good to accuse her. He loved Blondine, therefore, more and more from day to day and his heart grew cold to Brunette.\n\nThe ambitious queen Fourbette saw all this clearly and hated intensely the innocent and gentle Blondine. If she had not feared the rage of the king she would have made Blondine the most wretched child in the world.\n\nBenin had commanded that Blondine should never be left alone with the queen. He was known to be just and good but he punished disobedience severely and the queen herself dared not defy his commands."

      "body": "The Three Languages:\n\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town, and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you learnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I will send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back the father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered: ‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.\n\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs, which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so, they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of the castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower, and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the trouble.\n\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him, that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear."

      "body": "The Raven:\n\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young torun alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mothercould not quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, andseeing the ravens flying round the castle, she opened the window, andsaid: «I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have alittle peace.» Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when thechild in her arms was turned into a raven, and flew away from herthrough the open window. The bird took its flight to a dark wood andremained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hearnothing of their child.\n\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he hearda raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drewnear, the raven said, «I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am nowunder the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’«What am I to do?» he asked. She replied, «Go farther into the wooduntil you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offeryou food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, youwill fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In thegarden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must standand watch for me. I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock inthe afternoon for three successive days; the first day it will be drawnby four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by four blackhorses; but if you fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, Ishall not be set free.»\n\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, «Alas!I know even now that you will take something from the woman and beunable to save me.» The man assured her again that he would on noaccount touch a thing to eat or drink.\n\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him,and said, «Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let megive you something to eat and drink.»\n\n«No,» answered the man, «I will neither eat not drink.»\n\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, «If you willnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drinkcounts for nothing,» and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, anddrank.\n\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the gardenand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling offatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for alittle while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in anotherminute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such adeep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakenedhim. At two o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her fourwhite horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said toherself, sighing, «I know he has fallen asleep.» When she entered thegarden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on thetan-heap, fast asleep. She got out of her carriage and went to him;she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he stillcontinued sleeping.\n\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food anddrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistententreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drankagain.\n\nTowards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heapto watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began tofeel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and hecould not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fellfast asleep. As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, shesaid sorrowfully to herself, «I know he has fallen asleep.» She wentas before to look for him, but he slept, and it was impossible toawaken him.\n\nThe following day the old woman said to him, «What is this? You arenot eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?»\n\nHe answered, «I may not and will not either eat or drink.»\n\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front ofhim, and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist thetemptation, and took a deep draught.\n\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap inthe garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcomewith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himselfdown, he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seenapproaching, and this time her coachman and everything about her, aswell as her horses, were black.\n\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, «Iknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.» Shefound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were ofno avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flaskof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, theywould never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which hername was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his.Finally, she laid a letter near him, in which, after giving himparticulars of the food and drink she had left for him, she finishedwith the following words: «I see that as long as you remain here youwill never be able to set me free; if, however, you still wish to doso, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within yourpower to accomplish.» She then returned to her carriage and drove tothe golden castle of Stromberg.\n\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grievedat heart, and said, «She has no doubt been here and driven away again,and it is now too late for me to save her.» Then his eyes fell onthe things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knewfrom it all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to starton his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no ideain which direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time insearch of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he wenton walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Oncemore the night came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush andfell asleep. Again the next day he pursued his way through theforest, and that evening, thinking to rest again, he lay down asbefore, but he heard such a howling and wailing that he found itimpossible to sleep. He waited till it was darker and people had begunto light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him,he went towards it.\n\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller thanit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immensegiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, «If the giantsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.» However, aftera while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant sawhim, he called out, «It is lucky for that you have come, for I havenot had anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for mysupper.» «I would rather you let that alone,» said the man, «for I donot willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food Ihave enough to satisfy your hunger.» «If that is so,» replied thegiant, «I will leave you in peace; I only thought of eating you becauseI had nothing else.»\n\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought outthe bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk ofthem, were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer,and ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished hissupper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle ofStromberg. The giant said, «I will look on my map; on it are markedall the towns, villages, and houses.» So he fetched his map, andlooked for the castle, but could not find it. «Never mind,» he said,«I have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look onthose,» but they searched in vain, for the castle was not markedeven on these. The man now thought he should like to continue hisjourney, but the giant begged him to remain for a day or two longeruntil the return of his brother, who was away in search ofprovisions. When the brother came home, they asked him about the castleof Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soonas he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when he hadfinished his supper, they all went up together to his room and lookedthrough his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he fetchedother older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until atlast they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. «How shall Ibe able to get there?» asked the man. «I have two hours to spare,’said the giant, «and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of thecastle; I must then return to look after the child who is in our care.»\n\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leaguesof the castle, where he left him, saying, «You will be able to walkthe remainder of the way yourself.» The man journeyed on day and nighttill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw theenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He wasoverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain,but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climbhe fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, hewas greatly grieved, and said to himself, «I will remain here and waitfor her,» so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat andwatched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughterdriving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\n\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting andhe called out to them, «God be with you.» They stopped when they heardthe call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again withtheir fighting, which now became more furious. «God be with you,’he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing noone went back to their fighting. A third time he called out, «God bewith you,» and then thinking he should like to know the cause ofdispute between the three men, he went out and asked them why they werefighting so angrily with one another. One of them said that he hadfound a stick, and that he had but to strike it against any doorthrough which he wished to pass, and it immediately flew open.Another told him that he had found a cloak which rendered its wearerinvisible; and the third had caught a horse which would carry itsrider over any obstacle, and even up the glass mountain. They had beenunable to decide whether they would keep together and have the thingsin common, or whether they would separate. On hearing this, the mansaid, «I will give you something in exchange for those three things;not money, for that I have not got, but something that is of farmore value. I must first, however, prove whether all you have told meabout your three things is true.» The robbers, therefore, made him geton the horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he hadput this round him he was no longer visible. Then he fell upon themwith the stick and beat them one after another, crying, «There, youidle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!»\n\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate ofthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted thesteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a goldengoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for hestill wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off hisfinger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched thebottom. «That is my own ring,» she exclaimed, «and if that is so theman must also be here who is coming to set me free.»\n\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown offthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him,and cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms;and she kissed him, and said, «Now you have indeed set me free, andtomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.»"

      "body": "Smut:\n\nNOW, this story is quite true. Once upon a time, there was a cat called Mr. Puff; he lived in a grand house, quite close to the Turkish Embassy. A lord and a lady ‘and several servants lived with Mr. Puff; he was very kind to them, letting them do in all things as they liked, and never sending them away or keeping the house to himself. One day Mr. Puff, being out in the rain, found a poor little kitten, covered with mud, and crying bitterly: so Mr. Puff took the kitten between his teeth, carried it home, and set it down on the drawing-room hearth-rug. The lord and the lady had the kitten washed, and gave it food, and called it Smut. Then Smut went and sat him down on the lord‘s writing-table.\n\nWhen Smut grew to be a cat, but before he was still a large one, the lord and the lady thought awhile, and spoke, “ We have a dear friend, “ they said, “and he is catless; therefore, if Mr. Puff will agree, we will take Smut to him as a present. “ And Mr. Puff agreed. So Smut was put into a birdcage, for there was nothing else to serve him for a traveling carriage, and taken to the dear friend‘s house.\n\nThe dear friend had a little girl with golden hair, and when she saw Smut, she cried out for joy, and said, “Never before did I see a dicky-bird with a furry coat, a long tail, and little white teeth. “ But Smut shook his head as if to say, “I am not a dicky-bird, sweet maid, but only a four-legged cat; “ then they opened the birdcage door, and he walked out, waving his tail.\n\nNow, as Smut grew up, his gravity and dignity made all who knew his history wonder, and few could believe that he had once been a dirty kitten, covered with mud, glad to accept the charity of Mr. Puff. When a year had gone, or perhaps even a longer time, there was a great war in Turkey, and terrible battles were fought. Then Smut looked very anxious and went quite bald, and his coat fell off in little patches, but no one could tell why. At last, he died, and the little girl wept sorely, and all who had known him grieved and lamented. \n\nAnd when Smut had been sleeping only a little while beneath the lilac tree, accident revealed that, instead of a lowly foundling, he had been of high degree, for the little vagrant Mr. Puff had found was no less a person than the Turkish Ambassador‘s coachman‘s wife‘s cat‘s kitten."

      "body": "The Wedding Of Mrs Fox:\n\nOnce upon a time there was an old fox with nine tails. He did not believe that his wife was faithful to him and wanted to put her to the test. He stretched himself out beneath the bench, did not move a limb, and pretended to be stone dead.\n\nMrs. Fox locked herself in her room, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat on the hearth and cooked.\n\nAs soon as it became known that the old fox had died, suitors began to appear. The maid heard someone knocking at the front door. She opened it, and there stood a young fox, who said:\n\nWhat are you doing, Miss Cat?\nAre you asleep, or are you awake?\nShe answered:\n\nI'm not asleep; I am awake.\nDo you want to know what I am doing?\nI am cooking warm beer with butter in it.\nWould you like to be my guest?\n\"No thank you, Miss,\" said the fox. \"What is Mrs. Fox doing?\"\n\nThe maid answered:\n\nShe is sitting in her room\nMourning and grieving.\nShe has cried her eyes red,\nBecause old Mr. Fox is dead.\n\"Miss, tell her that a young fox is here who would like to court her.\"\n\n\"I'll do that, young man.\"\n\nThe cat went upstairs and knocked on the door.\n\n\"Mrs. Fox, are you there?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, yes.\"\n\n\"A suitor is outside.\"\n\n\"What does he look like? Does he have nine bushy tails like the late Mr. Fox?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the cat. \"He has but one.\"\n\n\"Then I'll not have him.\"\n\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the suitor away.\n\nSoon afterward there was another knock at the door. Another fox was there who wanted to court Mrs. Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare any better than the first one. Then others came, each with one additional tail, but all were turned away until finally one came who had nine tails, just like old Mr. Fox. When the widow heard that, she spoke joyfully to the cat:\n\nOpen up the door\nAnd throw old Mr. Fox out.\nThey were just about to celebrate the wedding when beneath the bench old Mr. Fox began to stir. He attacked the entire party with blows and drove them all out of the house, including Mrs. Fox.\n\nSecond Tale\nFollowing the death of old Mr. Fox, the wolf presented himself as a suitor. The cat, who was serving as Mrs. Fox's maid, opened the door. The wolf greeted her, saying:\n\nGood day, Mrs. Cat,\nWhy are you sitting alone?\nWhat good things are you making there?\nThe cat answered:\n\nBread and milk.\nWould you like to be my guest?\n\"No thank you, Mrs. Cat.\" answered the wolf. \"Isn't Mrs. Fox at home?\"\n\nThe cat said:\n\nShe's upstairs in her room\nMourning and grieving,\nBemoaning her plight,\nBecause old Mr. Fox is dead.\nThe wolf answered:\n\nIf she wants another man,\nJust have her come downstairs.\nThe cat ran upstairs\nTo give her the news.\nShe ran to the great room,\nAnd knocked on the door\nWith her five golden rings.\n\"Mrs. Fox, are you in there?\nDo you want another man?\"\nMrs. Fox asked, \"Is the gentleman wearing red breeches, and does he have a pointed little face?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the cat.\n\n\"Then he's of no use to me.\"\n\nAfter the wolf had been sent away there came a dog, a deer, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the other animals of the forest, one after the other. But each one lacked one of the good qualities that old Mr. Fox had had, and the cat had to send each of the suitors away. Finally a young fox came.\n\nMrs. Fox asked, \"Is the gentleman wearing red breeches, and does he have a pointed little face?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the cat, \"that he does.\"\n\n\"Then let him come upstairs,\" said Mrs. Fox, and she told the maid to make preparations for the wedding feast.\n\nCat, sweep out the kitchen,\nAnd throw the old fox out the window.\nHe brought home many a big fat mouse,\nBut he ate them all alone,\nAnd never gave me a one.\nThen Mrs. Fox married young Mr. Fox, and everyone danced and celebrated, and if they have not stopped, then they are dancing still."

      "body": "Cat And Mouse In Partnership:\n\nA cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship that he felt for her, that at last the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together. \"But we must make preparations for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger,\" said the cat, \"and you, little mouse, cannot venture out everywhere, or in the end you will be caught in a trap.\"\n\nThis good advice was followed, and they bought a pot of fat, but they did not know where to store it. Finally, after much consideration, the cat said, \"I know of no place where it will be better stored up than in the church. No one dares take anything away from there. We will put it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are need it.\"\n\nSo the pot was stored safely away, but it was not long before the cat took a great longing for it, and said to the mouse, \"I wanted to tell you, little mouse, that my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and she has asked me to be his godfather. He is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the baptismal font. Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered the mouse. \"By all means go, and if you get anything good to eat, think of me. I would like to drink a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\"\n\nAll this, however, was untrue. The cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godfather. He went straight to the church, crept up to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked off the top of the fat. Then he went for a stroll on the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then stretched out in the sun, licking his whiskers whenever he thought of the pot of fat. He did not return home until it was evening.\n\n\"Well, here you are again,\" said the mouse. \"You must have had a happy day.\"\n\n\"Everything went well,\" answered the cat.\n\n\"What name did they give the child?\" asked the mouse.\n\n\"Top-Off,\" said the cat quite coolly.\n\n\"Top-Off?\" cried the mouse. \"That is a very odd and uncommon name. Is it a usual one in your family?\"\n\n\"What does that matter?\", said the cat. \"It is no worse than Crumb-Thief, as your godchildren are called.\"\n\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of longing. He said to the mouse, \"You must do me a favor, and once more manage the house alone for a day. I have been asked again to be godfather, and since the child has a white ring around its neck, I cannot refuse.\"\n\nThe good mouse consented. However, the cat crept behind the town wall to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat. \"Nothing tastes as good as that which one eats by oneself,\" he said, and was quite satisfied with his day's work.\n\nWhen he arrived home the mouse asked, \"What name was this child christened with?\"\n\n\"Half-Gone,\" answered the cat.\n\n\"Half-Gone? What are you saying? I have never heard that name in all my life. I'll wager it is not in the almanac.\"\n\nThe cat's mouth soon again began to water for the delicious goods. \"All good things come in threes,\" he said to the mouse. \"I have been asked to be godfather again. The child is totally black, only it has white paws. Otherwise it has not a single white hair on its whole body. This only happens once every few years. You will let me go, won't you?\"\n\n\"Top-Off. Half-Gone,\" answered the mouse. \"They are such odd names, that they make me stop and think.\"\n\n\"Here you sit at home,\" said the cat, \"with your dark gray fur coat and long braid of hair capturing fantasies. That is because you do not go out in the daytime.\"\n\nDuring the cat's absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat devoured all the rest of the fat. \"One has peace only after everything is eaten up,\" he said to himself. Well filled and fat, he did not return home until nighttime.\n\nThe mouse immediately asked what name had been given to the third child.\n\n\"You will not like it either,\" said the cat. \"His name is All-Gone.\"\n\n\"All-Gone!\", cried the mouse. \"That is the most worrisome name of all. I have never seen it in print. All-Gone! What can that mean?\" Then she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep.\n\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godfather, but when winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their stored food, and said, \"Come cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves. It will taste good now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the cat. \"You will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.\"\n\nThey set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of fat, to be sure, was still in its place, but it was empty. \"Alas,\" said the mouse, \"now I see what has happened. Now it comes to light. You are a true friend. You ate everything when you were serving as a godfather. First top off, then half done, then ...\"\n\n\"Be quiet!\" cried the cat. \"One more word, and I will eat you too.\"\n\n\"All gone\" was already on the poor mouse's lips. She had scarcely spoken it before the cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. You see, that is the way of the world."

      "body": "Snowdrop:\n\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\n\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon herself in it, and say:\n\n'Tell me, glass, tell me true!  Of all the ladies in the land,  Who is fairest, tell me, who?'\nAnd the glass had always answered:\n\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.'\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual:\n\n'Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!'\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\n\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.\n\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second, ‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth, ‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.\n\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.’\n\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and said:\n\n'Tell me, glass, tell me true!  Of all the ladies in the land,  Who is fairest, tell me, who?'\nAnd the glass answered:\n\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.'\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door. ‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\n\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.’\n\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:\n\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.'\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.\n\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’ ‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:\n\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.'\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.\n\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\n\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe with me.’\n\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.\n\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:\n\n'Tell me, glass, tell me true!  Of all the ladies in the land,  Who is fairest, tell me, who?'\nAnd the glass answered:\n\n'Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.'\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need."

He fakes his death with the help of a dead pig’s blood. When Huck runs away, he finds an island. There, he comes to know that searchers from the town are searching for him in the river. Huck decides to stay in hiding.\n\nHe soon encounters a runaway slave. After hearing the slave’s story, Huck thinks it is best to help him. Although he didn’t know if what he was doing was right or wrong. While the two camped out, a storm makes the Mississippi river flood. These two, make a raft when they see a house floating. They loot the house.\n\nWhen they do so, they find a dead body inside the house. The slave, Jim, refuses to let Huck see the dead man’s face. They leave the house. Soon, Huck learns that Jim’s owner has seen smoke coming from woods. And knows that Jim is hiding there. He also learns that there is a reward for Jim’s capture. They decide to run away.\n\nThey take their raft and move downriver, towards Ohio River. Slavery was prohibited there. On their way, these two run into a gang of robbers. Huck and Jim are captured. But in the end, they run off with the robber’s treasure.\n\nThey continue towards the Ohio river. But during night time’s fog, they miss the mouth of the river and float to the people looking for Jim instead. Upon being accused of stealing another person’s property, Huck lies. He tells them that his father on the raft is suffering from smallpox. The men leave Huck and go away. Next night, a steam boat rips the raft into two. And the two of them are separated.\n\nHuck ends up at the house of Grangerfords who were fighting another family, Shepherdsons. The reason for the fight was the elopement of son and daughter of the family. A gun fight broke out and many from both sides died. Before Huck could do something, Jim returns with a repaired raft.\n\nJim and Huck run away. They rescue two phony aristocrats. All of them continued downriver, still. Soon, they came to a town. There they heard talks of a rich man dying and leaving his inheritance for his two brothers. The two phony aristocrats enter, pretending to be the brothers. They are welcomed by Wilk’s sisters, the dead man and soon the procedure of letting out the inheritance begins.\n\nThe townspeople were dubious of trusting the two phonies. Huck tells the oldest of Wilk’s sister about the scam. But before something can happen, the real brothers arrive. The phonies, Huck and Jim leave the town. The two phonies, then sell Jim to a local farmer. They also tell the farmer that a reward is being offered for the runaway slave.\n\nHuck finds out and goes to rescue Jim. As it turns out Jim was being held in Tom’s aunt and uncle’s house. They mistake Huck for Tom. Tom was about to visit them. When Tom arrives, Huck tells him everything before Tom reaches the house. Tom then, pretends to be his own younger brother. They hatch a plan to escape together with Jim.\n\nBut when they escape, Tom is shot in the leg. Poor Jim gives up running away and helps Tom. While Huck went to find a doctor, Jim was bound in chains again. Next morning Tom reveals that Jim had always been free. Huck and Tom were playing a game as a payback for the troubles they caused Jim. Aunty Polly, the one with whom Tom stayed, arrives.\n\nShe then identifies the two for who they actually are. The other aunt wants to adopt Huck. But Huck reveals that he doesn’t want to be civilized and he wants to go west. Tom returns to his town, and Huck sets for the west."

He thought about what he would do. It became very dark. As the woodcutter turned around, a huge troll was standing next to him. The woodcutter was scared though he pretended not to be.\n\n“Please, master! Lend me five yen. I’ll repay you tomorrow!” cried the troll. That was all the woodcutter’s money. However, the woodcutter was still scared, so he gave the troll five yen. He went home with nothing.\n\nThe next day, the woodcutter waited all day long for the troll. Finally, at night, the troll came and returned with his five yen. The next day, the troll came back.

The pebbles flew out the the magic stick. They covered the woodcutter’s son’s field. “Oh, no! My field,” cried the woodcutter’s son. That night, he did not sleep and was thinking what to do all night.\n\nFinally, he came up with an idea. The woodcutter’s son waited for the troll the next day. At night, the troll appeared. The woodcutter’s son began to talk, “Pebbles helped my vegetables to grow. I’m so lucky! Manure would ruin my field!” The troll was totally confused after hearing his statement.\n\nThe next morning, the woodcutter’s son ran to his feet. His field was covered in manure. The troll had fallen for his trick. The woodcutter’s son grew many vegetables. They were the best vegetables in the village. He grew vegetables on every season.

      "body": "Briar Rose:\n\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off, where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank. \n\nThen the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, ’I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me–you will soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. \n\nBut the queen said, ’I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom; but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her. So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand: and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world.\n\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining- hall. Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge. So she cried out, ’The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years.\n\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew her loved her.\n\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily. \n\n’Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ’what are you doing there?’ ’Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ’How prettily that little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground.\n\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\n\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\n\nAfter many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose, lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died. Then the young prince said, ’All this shall not frighten me; I will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but he was bent upon going.\n\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as if she was going to beat the boy.\n\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay, fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss. But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. \n\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear.\n\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long."

      "body": "Hans In Luck:\n\nHans had served his master for seven years, so he said to him, \"Master, my time is up, now I should be glad to go back home to my mother, give me my wages.\"\n\nThe master answered, \"You have served me faithfully and honestly, as the service was so shall the reward be\". And he gave Hans a piece of gold as big as his head.\n\nHans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket, wrapped up the lump in it, put it on his shoulder, and set out on the way home.\n\nAs he went on, always putting one foot before the other, he saw a horseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse. \"Ah, said Hans quite loud, what a fine thing it is to ride. There you sit as on a chair, you stumble over no stones, you save your shoes, and cover the ground, you don't know how.\"\n\nThe rider, who had heard him, stopped and called out, \"Hi, there, Hans, why do you go on foot, then.\"\n\n\"I must,\" answered he, \"for I have this lump to carry home, it is true that it is gold, but I cannot hold my head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what,\" said the rider, \"we will exchange, I will give you my horse, and you can give me your lump.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Hans, \"but I can tell you, you will have to crawl along with it.\"\n\nThe rider got down, took the gold, and helped Hans up, then gave him the bridle tight in his hands and said, \"If you want to go at a really good pace, you must click your tongue and call out, jup, jup.\"\n\nHans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so bold and free. After a little while he thought that it ought to go faster, and he began to click with his tongue and call out, jup. Jup.\n\nThe horse put himself into a sharp trot, and before Hans knew where he was, he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field from the highway. The horse would have gone off too if it had not been stopped by a countryman, who was coming along the road and driving a cow before him. Hans pulled himself together and stood up on his legs again.\n\nHe was vexed, and said to the countryman, \"It is a poor joke, this riding, especially when one gets hold of a mare like this, that kicks and throws one off, so that one has a chance of breaking one's neck. Never again will I mount it. Now I like your cow, for one can walk quietly behind her, and have, over and above, one's milk, butter and cheese every day without fail. What would I not give to have such a cow.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the countryman, \"if it would give you so much pleasure, I do not mind giving the cow for the horse.\"\n\nHans agreed with the greatest delight, the countryman jumped upon the horse, and rode quickly away.\n\nHans drove his cow quietly before him, and thought over his lucky bargain. \"If only I have a morsel of bread - and that can hardly fail me - I can eat butter and cheese with it as often as I like, if I am thirsty, I can milk my cow and drink the milk. My goodness, what more can I want.\"\n\nWhen he came to an inn he made a halt, and in his great concern ate up what he had with him - his dinner and supper - and all he had, and with his last few farthings had half a glass of beer. Then he drove his cow onwards along the road to his mother's village.\n\nAs it drew nearer mid-day, the heat was more oppressive, and Hans found himself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross. He felt it very hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst.\n\n\"I can find a cure for this,\" thought Hans, \"I will milk the cow now and refresh myself with the milk.\"\n\nHe tied her to a withered tree, and as he had no pail he put his leather cap underneath, but try as he would, not a drop of milk came. And as he set himself to work in a clumsy way, the impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its hind foot, that he fell on the ground, and for a long time could not think where he was.\n\nBy good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a wheel-barrow, in which lay a young pig.\n\n\"What sort of a trick is this,\" cried he, and helped the good Hans up. Hans told him what had happened. The butcher gave him his flask and said, \"take a drink and refresh yourself. The cow will certainly give no milk, it is an old beast, at the best it is only fit for the plough, or for the butcher.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Hans, as he stroked his hair down on his head, \"who would have thought it. Certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast like that at home, what meat one has. But I do not care much for beef, it is not juicy enough for me. A young pig like that now is the thing to have, it tastes quite different, and then there are the sausages.\"\n\n\"Listen, Hans,\" said the butcher, \"out of love for you I will exchange, and will let you have the pig for the cow.\"\n\n\"Heaven repay you for your kindness,\" said Hans as he gave up the cow, whilst the pig was unbound from the barrow, and the cord by which it was tied was put in his hand.\n\nHans went on, and thought to himself how everything was going just as he wished, if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set right. Presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They said good morning to each other, and Hans began to tell of his good luck, and how he had always made such good bargains. The boy told him that he was taking the goose to a christening-feast.\n\n\"Just lift her,\" added he, \"and laid hold of her by the wings, how heavy she is - she has been fattened up for the last eight weeks. Whosoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to wipe the fat from both sides of his mouth.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hans, as he weighed her in one hand, \"she is a good weight, but my pig is no bad one.\" Meanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other, and shook his head.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said at length, \"it may not be all right with your pig. In the village through which I passed, the mayor himself had just had one stolen out of its sty. I fear - I fear that you have got hold of it there. They have sent out some people and it would be a bad business if they caught you with the pig, at the very least, you would be shut up in the dark hole.\"\n\nThe good Hans was terrified. \"Goodness,\" he said, \"help me out of this fix, you know more about this place than I do, take my pig and leave me your goose.\"\n\n\"I shall risk something at that game,\" answered the lad, \"but I will not be the cause of your getting into trouble.\"\n\nSo he took the cord in his hand, and drove away the pig quickly along a by-path. The good Hans, free from care, went homewards with the goose under his arm.\n\n\"When I think over it properly,\" said he to himself, \"I have even gained by the exchange. First there is the good roast meat, then the quantity of fat which will drip from it, and which will give me dripping for my bread for a quarter of a year, and lastly the beautiful white feathers. I will have my pillow stuffed with them, and then indeed I shall go to sleep without rocking. How glad my mother will be.\"\n\nAs he was going through the last village, there stood a scissors-grinder with his barrow, as his wheel whirred he sang,\n\nI sharpen scissors and quickly grind,\nMy coat blows out in the wind behind.\nHans stood still and looked at him, at last he spoke to him and said, \"All's well with you, as you are so merry with your grinding.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the scissors-grinder, \"the trade has a golden foundation. A real grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket finds gold in it. But where did you buy that fine goose?\"\n\n\"I did not buy it, but exchanged my pig for it.\"\n\n\"And the pig?\"\n\n\"That I got for a cow.\"\n\n\"And the cow?\"\n\n\"I took that instead of a horse.\"\n\n\"And the horse?\"\n\n\"For that I gave a lump of gold as big as my head.\"\n\n\"And the gold?\"\n\n\"Well, that was my wages for seven years of service.\"\n\n\"You have known how to look after yourself each time,\" said the grinder. \"If you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in your pocket whenever you stand up, you will have made your fortune.\"\n\n\"How shall I manage that?\" said Hans.\n\n\"You must be a grinder, as I am, nothing particular is wanted for it but a grindstone, the rest finds itself. I have one here, it is certainly a little worn, but you need not give me anything for it but your goose, will you do it?\"\n\n\"How can you ask,\" answered Hans. \"I shall be the luckiest fellow on earth. If I have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, why should I ever worry again.\" And he handed him the goose and received the grindstone in exchange.\n\n\"Now,\" said the grinder, as he took up an ordinary heavy stone that lay by him, \"here is a strong stone for you into the bargain, you can hammer well upon it, and straighten your old nails. Take it with you and keep it carefully.\"\n\nHans loaded himself with the stones, and went on with a contented heart, his eyes shining with joy. \"I must have been born with a caul,\" he cried, \"everything I want happens to me just as if I were a sunday-child.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as he had been on his legs since daybreak, he began to feel tired. Hunger also tormented him, for in his joy at the bargain by which he got the cow he had eaten up all his store of food at once. At last he could only go on with great trouble, and was forced to stop every minute, the stones, too, weighed him down dreadfully. Then he could not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry them just then.\n\nHe crept like a snail to a well in a field, and there he thought that he would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water, but in order that he might not injure the stones in sitting down, he laid them carefully by his side on the edge of the well. Then he sat down on it, and was to stoop and drink, when he made a slip, pushed against the stones, and both of them fell into the water.\n\nWhen Hans saw them with his own eyes sinking to the bottom, he jumped for joy, and then knelt down, and with tears in his eyes thanked God for having shown him this favor also, and delivered him in so good a way, and without his having any need to reproach himself, from those heavy stones which had been the only things that troubled him.\n\n\"There is no man under the sun so fortunate as I,\" he cried out.\n\nWith a light heart and free from every burden he now ran on until he was with his mother at home."

      "body": "The Day Walk Made a Friend:\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a beautiful and extremely amiable girl named, Walk. She was a good girl, but she never liked her name as all the kids around her made fun of her name. She ran away from everybody who teased her name and hence, Walk never really had friends. She would play alone all the time.\n\nOn a regular day, when Walk returned home from school, she finished her homework as soon as possible and asked her mother, if she could go out and play. Her mother said yes, but warned her to not wander and go far away from home.\n\nWalk was happy that day; she went to her favorite spot near the river running just behind her house. Walk had this theory that wherever the river was splashing and moving, it meant that the river water was taking to her. Walk spoke back to the river in her own little weird way.\n\nToday, when talking to the river, she said, \"You are so fortunate river, as you get to travel different places and always be with your friends- ducks, turtles, fishes, and plants. I wish I had more friends and wouldn't be alone anymore.\"\n\nWhen she was bored talking to the river, she would pick up stones from nearby and try to skip them across the river like her dad. However, she would fail most of the times.\n\nShe would then say to the river, \"I am getting better each day. I am more of a thrower than a skipper.\" After many attempts at skipping rock, she finally finds a perfect rock, almost round, flat, and protruding at one end where she could hold and skip it in water.\n\nShe held the stone tight in her fingers, and innocently said to the river, \"Oh dear river, If only I could skip this rock and make a wish, I would wish for a dear friend just like you, and if the rock skips all the way across you while wishing, I wouldn't be as lonely as I am now.\" Saying this, Walk whipped her arm back just like her dad had taught her and skipped the rock across the river with full force and dedication.\n\nShe watched the rock skip once, twice, thrice, and she kept wishing for a friend while counting. To her amazement, the rock went on skipping for the fourth, fifth and sixth time, and eventually on the seventh skip, it finally made it across the river on to the shore of the opposite side. Walk was totally taken aback. She had been holding her breath so hard and wishing so desperately that when the stone skipped the river and landed across she could not just believe her eyes.\n\nHer deep thoughts and sheer happiness were disturbed when she heard footsteps coming her way. Walk immediately came to senses and started looking around. A little girl was tumbling down towards her. Walk panicked and started to run but she lost her balance and she fell off too. Rolling down towards the river, the unknown little girl and Walk fell almost on the same spot beside each other.\n\nThe tumbling girl was crying profusely and endlessly holding on to her knee. Walk pulled herself together and went close to the girl to help her. Walk saw that the girl's knee was bleeding. She said the calmest words to her, \"It will be alright, I will help you clean the wound.\" Walk took some water from the river, washed away the blood from the wound, tore a piece of cloth from her skirt, and tied it around the wound on the knee to cover the cut. She politely said to the girl, \"My house is nearby, let me help you, my mother will take care of the wound.\"\n\nWalk helped the girl walk until her house. Once they both had reached Walk's house, Walk called out to her mother, \"Mother, there is a girl with me and she fell down by the river. Her knee is cut and there is blood all over her dress.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Walk's mother came running out of the kitchen with the first-aid box. She made the little girl sit on a couch and started cleaning the wound. She cleaned her knee with an antiseptic and applied colorful bandages to lighten up the girl's face. She then enquired the girl asking her where she lived. The girl promptly told Walk and her mother that she had just moved in a house probably next door. All the houses looked so similar that she mixed up the one she lived in. Walk gasped and felt a hint of joy think about her wish.\n\nThe little girl looked at Walk and asked, \"What is your name?\" Walk was stunned and scared to tell her name because she did not want the girl to make fun of her name like other kids. However, Walk's mother replied, \"Her name is Walk and I am glad she could help you.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the little girl began to laugh and almost happen to fall on the ground. Walk felt the pinch and she was on the verge of breaking into tears. Walk closed her eyes, and said to herself, \"Is this the friend I get in return for my wish?\" Just then, the girl stopped laughing and voluntarily said, \"I am sorry for my manners, but it is absolutely funny as my name happens to be Run.\"\n\nWalk gave a surprised look to her new friend and almost broke into laughter herself. Just to make sure she asked Run whether her name was seriously \"Run,\" and she was not trying to make fun of her. Run reassuringly said to Walk, \"You helped me and wiped my wound, why would I ever lie to you or even make fun of you.\"\n\nListening to these words, Walk felt tremendous happiness and was filled with joy. Her wish to the river had come true, and now she had a very good friend named Run.\n\nWalk would never forget that day. It was the day Walk and Run became the best of friends forever."
