      "body": "Long time ago there lived a priest who was extremely lazy and poor at the same time. He did not want to do any hard work but used to dream of being rich one day. He got his food by begging for alms. One morning he got a pot of milk as part of the alms. He was extremely delighted and went home with the pot of milk. He boiled the milk, drank some of it and put the remaining milk in a pot. He added slight curds in the pot for converting the milk to curd. He then lay down to sleep.\n\nSoon he started imagining about the pot of curd while he lay asleep. He dreamed that if he could become rich somehow all his miseries would be gone. His thoughts turned to the pot of milk he had set to form curd. He dreamed on; \"By morning the pot of milk would set, it would be converted to curd. I would churn the curd and make butter from it. I would heat the butter and make ghee out of it. I will then go to that market and sell that ghee, and make some money. With that money i will buy a hen. The hen will lay may eggs which will hatch and there will be many chicken. These chicken will in turn lay hundreds of eggs and I will soon have a poultry farm of my own.\" He kept on imagining.\n\n\"I will sell all the hens of my poultry and buy some cows, and open a milk dairy. All the town people will buy milk from me. I will be very rich and soon I shall buy jewels. The king will buy all the jewels from me. I will be so rich that I will be able to marry an exceptionally beautiful girl from a rich family. Soon I will have a handsome son. If he does any mischief I will be very angry and to teach him a lesson, I will hit him with a big stick.\"During this dream, he involuntarily picked up the stick next to his bed and thinking that he was beating his son, raised the stick and hit the pot. The pot of milk broke and he awoke from his day dream.\n\nMoral: There is no substitute for hard work. Dreams cannot be fulfilled without hard work."

      "body": "A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda carton and pulled it over to the telephone. He climbed onto the carton so that he could reach the buttons on the phone and proceeded to punch in seven digits (phone numbers). The store-owner observed and listened to the conversation.\n\nBoy: 'Lady, Can you give me the job of cutting your lawn?\n\nWoman: (at the other end of the phone line): 'I already have someone to cut my lawn.'\n\nBoy: 'Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your lawn now.'\n\nWoman: I'm very satisfied with the person who is presently cutting my lawn.\n\nBoy: (with more perseverance) : 'Lady, I'll even sweep your curb and your sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the prettiest lawn in all of Palm beach , Florida.'\n\nWoman: No, thank you.\n\nWith a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver. The store-owner, who was listening to all this, walked over to the boy.\n\nStore Owner: 'Son... I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and would like to offer you a job.'\n\nBoy: 'No thanks.'\n\nStore Owner: But you were really pleading for one.\n\nBoy: No Sir, I was just checking my performance at the Job I already have. I am the one who is working for that lady I was talking to!'\n\nMoral: This is what we call 'Self Appraisal'. Every time if we don't get ahead of others, we blame others for it. We should look to our self and compare, find own weaknesses and work hard to throw away weaknesses. Always Work Hard, Honest and with full Dedication. It will always pay up."

      "body": "I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Isidro. He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events to raise money for youth at risk programs.\n\nThe last time I was there he introduced me by saying, \"I want to tell you why I let Jack use my horse. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.\n\n\"That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.\n\n\"He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, `See me after class.'\n\n\"The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, `Why did I receive an F?'\n\n\"The teacher said, `This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, `If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'\n\n\"The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, `Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.' \"Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all.\n\nHe stated, \"You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.\"\n\nMonty then turned to the assembled group and said, \"I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.\" He added, \"The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week.\" When the teacher was leaving, he said, \"Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up on yours.\"\n\nMoral: Don't let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what. No Dream is too big or too small when one works hard to live it. One should always try making dreams come true no matter what."

Bhola is unhappy at the way Khandya is behaving because he is losing money in the process. He decides to teach Khandya a lesson.\n\nThe next day instead of salt bags he loads Khandya with bags of cotton. Khandya is unaware of the change. As planned, he falls into the water and gets the bags wet. He is surprised to find the load unbearable. His otherwise master also starts beating him.\n\nKhandya learns his lesson and starts behaving..\n\nMoral: Work with honesty and sincerity because laziness will ruin you."

      "body": "One day all the employees reached the office and they saw a big advice on the door on which it was written: \"Yesterday the person who has been hindering your growth in this company passed away. We invite you to join the funeral in the room that has been prepared in the gym\". In the beginning, they all got sad for the death of one of their colleagues, but after a while they started getting curious to know who was that man who hindered the growth of his colleagues and the company itself.\n\nThe excitement in the gym was such that security agents were ordered to control the crowd within the room. The more people reached the coffin, the more the excitement heated up. Everyone thought: \"Who is this guy who was hindering my progress? Well, at least he died!\" One by one the thrilled employees got closer to the coffin, and when they looked inside it they suddenly became speechless. They stood nearby the coffin, shocked and in silence, as if someone had touched the deepest part of their soul. There was a mirror inside the coffin: everyone who looked inside it could see himself.\n\nThere was also a sign next to the mirror that said: \"There is only one person who is capable to set limits to your growth: it is YOU.\" You are the only person who can revolutionize your life. You are the only person who can influence your happiness, your realization and your success. You are the only person who can help yourself. Your life does not change when your boss changes, when your friends change, when your partner changes, when your company changes. Your life changes when YOU change, when you go beyond your limiting beliefs, when you realize that you are the only one responsible for your life. \"The most important relationship you can have is the one you have with yourself\".\n\nMoral: The world is like a mirror: it gives back to anyone the reflection of the thoughts in which one has strongly believed. The world and your reality are like mirrors lying in a coffin, which show to any individual the death of his divine capability to imagine and create his happiness and his success. It's the way you face Life that makes the difference."

Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and begin to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that fell on his back, the donkey was doing some thing amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up.\n\nPretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and totted off!\n\nMoral: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick is too not to get bogged down by it. We can get out of the deepest wells by not stopping. And by never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!"

She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed. Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire.\n\nOnce the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot. He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup.\n\nTurning to her, he asked. \"Daughter, what do you see?\" \"Potatoes, eggs and coffee,\" she hastily replied.\n\n\"Look closer\", he said, \"and touch the potatoes.\" She did and noted that they were soft.\n\nHe then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg.\n\nFinally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face.\n\n\"Father, what does this mean?\" she asked.\n\nHe then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity-the boiling water. However, each one reacted differently. The potato went in strong, hard and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak. The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard. However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.\n\n\"Which one are you?\" he asked his daughter. \"When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean?\"\n\nMoral: In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is how you choose to react to it and what you make out of it.

      "body": "\"A water bearer in India had two large pots, each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots had a crack in it, and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master's house, the cracked pot arrived only half full.\n\nFor a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and a half pots full of water in his master's house. Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect to the end for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.\n\nAfter two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream. \"I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologize to you. \"Why?\" asked the bearer. \"What are you ashamed of?\" \"I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your master's house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of this work, and you don't get full value from your efforts,\" the pot said.\n\nThe water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said, \"As we return to the master's house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.\" Indeed, as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it somewhat. But at the end of the trail, it still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load, and so again it apologized to the bearer for its failure.\n\nThe bearer said to the pot, \"Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path, but not on the other pot's side? That's because I have always known about your flaw, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the stream, you've watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master's table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house.\"\n\nMoral: Each of us has our own unique flaws. We're all cracked pots. In this world, nothing goes to waste. You may think like the cracked pot that you are inefficient or useless in certain areas of your life, but somehow these flaws can turn out to be a blessing in disguise.\""

An encouraging word to someone who is down can lift them up and help them make it through the day. So be careful of what you say. Speak life to those who cross your path.

All my time evolved in taking care of the family, my kids, my husband, doing the house chores and of course working to earn a living. Whenever I get to be invited by my colleagues to go out after work, I politely declined telling them the truth that I have a family to take care after work. Not to mention the tons of laundry, errands and other house chores waiting for me. Well, I guess that is all part of motherhood. Of course, I took responsibility of my being a mother and wife and tried my very best to maximize my time as much as possible.\n\nBut then, as years passed by I realized that the chores were unending. My to-do list never seemed to have an end. Even if I try to finish all of it, new ones will always come up. I tried to prioritize my tasks and still feel very exhausted at the end of the day. I tried to share responsibilities with my husband and kids, but still felt that I have no time for myself. The chores seemed to be endless.\n\nI craved for \"me time. \" And when I say me time, I only meant being able to do my eyebrows in an unhurried way, having an hour or so of quiet bliss, playing candy crush, listening to music, reading a book, or watching a movie without being constantly interrupted by my toddler with the words, \"It's my turn, mama.\" I have been so used to not having time for myself that I didn't give much thought about that \"me time\" until just recently.\n\nAfter 10 long years of waiting, my immigrant visa application was finally approved and I had to travel to a new country all by myself. Since the agency was going to pay for my airfare only, my husband and kids will have to follow at a later date as soon as I can purchase their plane tickets.\n\nAnd so it happened.\n\nI was alone in an apartment. Now I can do whatever I wanted and keep the house clean and tidy. I can read my favorite books and do all that I wanted to do with my time. I practically had all the time for myself while waiting for my job orientation!\n\nBut surprisingly it didn't make me happy. I was lonely. No more daily routine of nagging and pushing the kids to get up and help out. I missed my kids, I missed my husband, I missed my family back home. (I don't think I miss the nagging part. I do not like it too.) I felt something in me was missing. My kids, my family are already part of me. I spent nights crying myself to sleep easing the loneliness within me.\n\nThen I came to realize that making time for me doesn't mean being away from those I love. I can still have a \"me time\" even if I have the kids around and endless chores and errands to take care. I can prioritize and plan. I can change my attitude and approach towards house chores and errands. Life wouldn't be the same without the people you love near you.\n\nAs of the moment, I am looking forward that they can join me soon and still have time for myself"

      "body": "Got Lost In Forest:\n\nFive wise men got lost in the forest.\nThe first one said:\nI will go the left my intuition tells me that.\nThe second one said:\nI will go the right because the right comes from the word rightness.\nThe third one said:\nI will go back we came from there, it means I will go out from the forest.\nThe fourth one said:\nI will go straight we should move forward, the forest will end and something new will open.\nThe fifth said:\nYou are all wrong. There is a better solution. Wait for me.\nHe found the tallest tree and climbed into it. While he was climbing everyone else scattered towards their own sides. From above he saw where they should go to leave the forest faster. Now he could even see in what order the other wise men will reach the end of the forest. He climbed higher and saw the shortest way. He understood the problem and found the best solution! He knew that he did everything right. And the others were wrong. They were stubborn and they didn’t listen to him. He was the real Wise Man!\nBut he was wrong.\nEveryone was right. The one who went to the left, found himself in the thicket. He had to starve and fight with wild animals.\nBut he learned how to survive in the forest; he became a part of the forest and could teach others the same.\n\nThe one, who went to the right, met thieves. They took everything from him and made him steal with them. \n\nBut after some time, he had woken up something in those thieves that they have forgotten \nhumanity and compassion. The remorse was so strong in some of them, that after his death they also became the wise men.\nThe one, who went back, made a pathway through the forest, which soon became a road for those who wanted to walk in the forest without being afraid of getting lost.\n\nThe one, who went straight, became a pioneer. He visited the places where no one else was and opened wonderful new possibilities for people, amazing healing plants and magnificent animals.\n\nThe one, who climbed into the tree, became a specialist of finding short ways. People turned to him when they wanted to find the fastest way to deal with their problems, even if it didn't lead to any development.\nThis is how the five wise men reached their destiny."

      "body": "The Love Of God:\n\nThe story starts out where she, Beth, is sitting at an airport terminal, waiting to board a plane. She was sitting there with several other people who were also waiting, whom she did not know.\n\nAs she waited, she pulled out her Bible and started reading. All of a sudden she felt as if the people sitting there around her, were looking at her. She looked up, but realized that they were looking just over her head, in the direction right behind her.\n\nShe turned around to see what everyone was looking at, and when she did, she saw a stewardess pushing a wheelchair, with the ugliest old man sitting in it, that she had ever seen before. She said he had this long white hair that was all tangled and such a mess. His face was really, really wrinkled, and he didn’t look friendly at all. She said she didn’t know why, but she felt drawn to the man, and thought at first that God wanted her to witness to him. In her mind she said she was thinking, “Oh, God, please, not now, not here.”\n\nNo matter what she did, she couldn’t get the man off of her mind, and all of a sudden she knew what God wanted her to do. She was supposed to brush this old man’s hair.\n\nShe went and knelt down in front of the old man, and said “Sir, may I have the honor of brushing your hair for you?”\n\nHe said “What?”\n\nShe thought, “Oh great, he’s hard of hearing.” Again, a little louder, she said, “Sir, may I have the honor of brushing your hair for you?”\n\nHe answered, “If you are going to talk to me, you are going to have to speak up, I am practically deaf.”\n\nSo this time, she was almost yelling, “Sir may I please have the honor of brushing your hair for you?”\n\nEveryone was watching to see what his response would be. The old man just looked at her confused, and said “Well, I guess if you really want to.”\n\nShe said, “I don’t even have a brush, but I thought I would ask anyway.”\n\nHe said, “Look in the bag hanging on the back of my chair, there is a brush in there.”\n\nSo she got the brush out and started brushing his hair. She has a little girl with long hair, so she has had lots of practice getting tangles out, and knew how to be gentle with him. She worked for a long time, until every last tangle was out.\n\nJust as she was finishing up, she heard the old man crying, and she went and put her hands on his knees, kneeling in front of him again looking directly into his eyes, and said “Sir, do you know Jesus?”\n\nHe answered, “Yes, of course I know Jesus. You see, my bride told me she couldn’t marry me unless I knew Jesus, so I learned all about Jesus, and asked Him to come into my heart many years ago, before I married my bride.”\n\nHe continued, “You know, I am on my way home to go and see my wife. I have been in the hospital for a long time, and had to have a special surgery in this town far from my home. My wife couldn’t come with me, because she is so frail herself.”\n\nHe said, “I was so worried about how terrible my hair looked, and I didn’t want her to see me looking so awful, but I couldn’t brush my hair, all by myself.”\n\nTears were rolling down his cheeks, as he thanked Beth for brushing his hair. He thanked her over and over again.\n\nShe was crying, people all around witnessing this were crying, and as they were all boarding the plane, the stewardess, who was also crying, stopped her, and asked, “Why did you do that?”\n\nAnd right there was the opportunity, the door that had been opened to share with someone else, the love of God. We don’t always understand God’s ways, but be ready, He may use us to meet the need of someone else, like He met the need of this old man, and in that moment, also calling out to a lost soul who needed to know about His love."

The whale was weighted down by hundreds of pounds of traps that caused her to struggle to stay afloat. She also had hundreds of yards of line rope wrapped around her tail, her torso and a line tugging in her mouth.\n\nA fisherman spotted her just east of the Farallone Islands (outside the Golden Gate) and radioed an environmental group for help. Within a few hours, the rescue team arrived and determined that she was so bad off, the only way to save her was to dive in and untangle her – a very dangerous proposition. One slap of the tail could kill a rescuer.\n\nThey worked for hours with curved knives and eventually freed her. When she was free, the divers say she swam in what seemed like joyous circles. She then came back to each and every diver, one at a time, and nudged them, pushed them gently around – she thanked them. Some said it was the most incredibly beautiful experience of their lives.\n\nThe guy who cut the rope out of her mouth says her eye was following him the whole time, and he will never be the same.\n\nMay you, and all those you love, be so blessed and fortunate… to be surrounded by people who will help you get untangled from the things that are binding you.\n\nAnd, may you always know the joy of giving and receiving gratitude."

When I finally came to the family, I saw the faces of those little children disfigured by hunger. There was no sorrow or sadness in their faces, just the deep pain of hunger. I gave the rice to the mother. She divided it in two, and went out, carrying half the rice with her. When she came back, I asked her, “Where did you go?” She gave me this simple answer, “To my neighbors-they are hungry also.”\n\nI was not surprised that she gave–because poor people are generous. But I was surprised that she knew they were hungry. As a rule, when we are suffering, we are so focused on ourselves we have no time for others.\n\n–Mother Teresa"

      "body": "The Power Of Determination:\n\nA true story about athlete Glenn Cunningham who was horribly burned in a schoolhouse fire at the age of 8. Doctors predicted he would never walk again. Determined to walk, Glenn would throw himself off his wheelchair and pull his body across the yard and along a fence. Twenty-two months later, he took his first steps and through sheer determination, learned to run despite the pain…\n\nThe little country schoolhouse was heated by an old-fashioned, pot-bellied coal stove. A little boy had the job of coming to school early each day to start the fire and warm the room before his teacher and his classmates arrived.\n\nOne morning they arrived to find the schoolhouse engulfed in flames. They dragged the unconscious little boy out of the flaming building more dead than alive. He had major burns over the lower half of his body and was taken to a nearby county hospital.\n\nFrom his bed the dreadfully burned, semi-conscious little boy faintly heard the doctor talking to his mother. The doctor told his mother that her son would surely die – which was for the best, really – for the terrible fire had devastated the lower half of his body.\n\nBut the brave boy didn’t want to die. He made up his mind that he would survive. Somehow, to the amazement of the physician, he did survive. When the mortal danger was past, he again heard the doctor and his mother speaking quietly. The mother was told that since the fire had destroyed so much flesh in the lower part of his body, it would almost be better if he had died, since he was doomed to be a lifetime cripple with no use at all of his lower limbs.\n\nOnce more the brave boy made up his mind. He would not be a cripple. He would walk. But unfortunately from the waist down, he had no motor ability. His thin legs just dangled there, all but lifeless.\n\nUltimately he was released from the hospital. Every day his mother would massage his little legs, but there was no feeling, no control, nothing. Yet his determination that he would walk was as strong as ever.\n\nWhen he wasn’t in bed, he was confined to a wheelchair. One sunny day his mother wheeled him out into the yard to get some fresh air. This day, instead of sitting there, he threw himself from the chair. He pulled himself across the grass, dragging his legs behind him.\n\nHe worked his way to the white picket fence bordering their lot. With great effort, he raised himself up on the fence. Then, stake by stake, he began dragging himself along the fence, resolved that he would walk. He started to do this every day until he wore a smooth path all around the yard beside the fence. There was nothing he wanted more than to develop life in those legs.\n\nUltimately through his daily massages, his iron persistence and his resolute determination, he did develop the ability to stand up, then to walk haltingly, then to walk by himself – and then – to run.\n\nHe began to walk to school, then to run to school, to run for the sheer joy of running. Later in college he made the track team.\n\nStill later in Madison Square Garden this young man who was not expected to survive, who would surely never walk, who could never hope to run – this determined young man, Dr. Glenn Cunningham, ran the world’s fastest mile**!"

      "body": "The Necklace:\n\nShe was one of those pretty and charming girls born, as though fate had blundered over her, into a family of artisans. She had no marriage portion, no expectations, no means of getting known, understood, loved, and wedded by a man of wealth and distinction; and she let herself be married off to a little clerk in the Ministry of Education. Her tastes were simple because she had never been able to afford any other, but she was as unhappy as though she had married beneath her; for women have no caste or class, their beauty, grace, and charm serving them for birth or family, their natural delicacy, their instinctive elegance, their nimbleness of wit, are their only mark of rank, and put the slum girl on a level with the highest lady in the land. \n\nShe suffered endlessly, feeling herself born for every delicacy and luxury. She suffered from the poorness of her house, from its mean walls, worn chairs, and ugly curtains. All these things, of which other women of her class would not even have been aware, tormented and insulted her. The sight of the little Breton girl who came to do the work in her little house aroused heart-broken regrets and hopeless dreams in her mind. She imagined silent antechambers, heavy with Oriental tapestries, lit by torches in lofty bronze sockets, with two tall footmen in knee-breeches sleeping in large arm-chairs, overcome by the heavy warmth of the stove. She imagined vast saloons hung with antique silks, exquisite pieces of furniture supporting priceless ornaments, and small, charming, perfumed rooms, created just for little parties of intimate friends, men who were famous and sought after, whose homage roused every other woman's envious longings. \n\nWhen she sat down for dinner at the round table covered with a three-days-old cloth, opposite her husband, who took the cover off the soup-tureen, exclaiming delightedly: \"Aha! Scotch broth! What could be better?\" she imagined delicate meals, gleaming silver, tapestries peopling the walls with folk of a past age and strange birds in faery forests; she imagined delicate food served in marvellous dishes, murmured gallantries, listened to with an inscrutable smile as one trifled with the rosy flesh of trout or wings of asparagus chicken. \n\nShe had no clothes, no jewels, nothing. And these were the only things she loved; she felt that she was made for them. She had longed so eagerly to charm, to be desired, to be wildly attractive and sought after. \n\nShe had a rich friend, an old school friend whom she refused to visit, because she suffered so keenly when she returned home. She would weep whole days, with grief, regret, despair, and misery. \n\n*\n\nOne evening her husband came home with an exultant air, holding a large envelope in his hand. \n\n\"Here's something for you,\" he said. \n\nSwiftly she tore the paper and drew out a printed card on which were these words: \"The Minister of Education and Madame Ramponneau request the pleasure of the company of Monsieur and Madame Loisel at the Ministry on the evening of Monday, January the 18th.\" \n\nInstead of being delighted, as her husband hoped, she flung the invitation petulantly across the table, murmuring: \"What do you want me to do with this?\" \n\n\"Why, darling, I thought you'd be pleased. You never go out, and this is a great occasion. I had tremendous trouble to get it. Every one wants one; it's very select, and very few go to the clerks. You'll see all the really big people there.\" \n\nShe looked at him out of furious eyes, and said impatiently: \"And what do you suppose I am to wear at such an affair?\" \n\nHe had not thought about it; he stammered: \"Why, the dress you go to the theatre in. It looks very nice, to me . . .\" \n\nHe stopped, stupefied and utterly at a loss when he saw that his wife was beginning to cry. Two large tears ran slowly down from the corners of her eyes towards the corners of her mouth. \n\n\"What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you?\" he faltered. \n\nBut with a violent effort she overcame her grief and replied in a calm voice, wiping her wet cheeks: \"Nothing. Only I haven't a dress and so I can't go to this party. Give your invitation to some friend of yours whose wife will be turned out better than I shall.\" \n\nHe was heart-broken. \n\n\"Look here, Mathilde,\" he persisted. \"What would be the cost of a suitable dress, which you could use on other occasions as well, something very simple?\" \n\nShe thought for several seconds, reckoning up prices and also wondering for how large a sum she could ask without bringing upon herself an immediate refusal and an exclamation of horror from the careful-minded clerk. \n\nAt last she replied with some hesitation: \"I don't know exactly, but I think I could do it on four hundred francs.\" \n\nHe grew slightly pale, for this was exactly the amount he had been saving for a gun, intending to get a little shooting next summer on the plain of Nanterre with some friends who went lark-shooting there on Sundays. Nevertheless he said: \"Very well. I'll give you four hundred francs. But try and get a really nice dress with the money.\" \n\nThe day of the party drew near, and Madame Loisel seemed sad, uneasy and anxious. Her dress was ready, however. One evening her husband said to her: \"What's the matter with you? You've been very odd for the last three days.\" \n\n\"I'm utterly miserable at not having any jewels, not a single stone, to wear,\" she replied. \"I shall look absolutely no one. I would almost rather not go to the party.\" \n\n\"Wear flowers,\" he said. \"They're very smart at this time of the year. For ten francs you could get two or three gorgeous roses.\" \n\nShe was not convinced. \n\n\"No . . . there's nothing so humiliating as looking poor in the middle of a lot of rich women.\" \n\n\"How stupid you are!\" exclaimed her husband. \"Go and see Madame Forestier and ask her to lend you some jewels. You know her quite well enough for that.\" \n\nShe uttered a cry of delight. \n\n\"That's true. I never thought of it.\" \n\nNext day she went to see her friend and told her her trouble. \n\nMadame Forestier went to her dressing-table, took up a large box, brought it to Madame Loisel, opened it, and said: \"Choose, my dear.\" \n\nFirst she saw some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a Venetian cross in gold and gems, of exquisite workmanship. She tried the effect of the jewels before the mirror, hesitating, unable to make up her mind to leave them, to give them up. She kept on asking: \"Haven't you anything else?\" \n\n\"Yes. Look for yourself. I don't know what you would like best.\" \n\nSuddenly she discovered, in a black satin case, a superb diamond necklace; her heart began to beat covetously. Her hands trembled as she lifted it. She fastened it round her neck, upon her high dress, and remained in ecstasy at sight of herself. \n\nThen, with hesitation, she asked in anguish: \"Could you lend me this, just this alone?\" \n\n\"Yes, of course.\" \n\nShe flung herself on her friend's breast, embraced her frenziedly, and went away with her treasure. The day of the party arrived. Madame Loisel was a success. She was the prettiest woman present, elegant, graceful, smiling, and quite above herself with happiness. All the men stared at her, inquired her name, and asked to be introduced to her. All the Under-Secretaries of State were eager to waltz with her. The Minister noticed her. She danced madly, ecstatically, drunk with pleasure, with no thought for anything, in the triumph of her beauty, in the pride of her success, in a cloud of happiness made up of this universal homage and admiration, of the desires she had aroused, of the completeness of a victory so dear to her feminine heart. She left about four o'clock in the morning. Since midnight her husband had been dozing in a deserted little room, in company with three other men whose wives were having a good time. He threw over her shoulders the garments he had brought for them to go home in, modest everyday clothes, whose poverty clashed with the beauty of the ball-dress. She was conscious of this and was anxious to hurry away, so that she should not be noticed by the other women putting on their costly furs. \n\nLoisel restrained her. \n\n\"Wait a little. You'll catch cold in the open. I'm going to fetch a cab.\" \n\nBut she did not listen to him and rapidly descended the staircase. When they were out in the street they could not find a cab; they began to look for one, shouting at the drivers whom they saw passing in the distance. \n\nThey walked down towards the Seine, desperate and shivering. At last they found on the quay one of those old nightprowling carriages which are only to be seen in Paris after dark, as though they were ashamed of their shabbiness in the daylight. \n\nIt brought them to their door in the Rue des Martyrs, and sadly they walked up to their own apartment. It was the end, for her. As for him, he was thinking that he must be at the office at ten. \n\nShe took off the garments in which she had wrapped her shoulders, so as to see herself in all her glory before the mirror. But suddenly she uttered a cry. The necklace was no longer round her neck! \n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" asked her husband, already half undressed. \n\nShe turned towards him in the utmost distress. \n\n\"I . . . I . . . I've no longer got Madame Forestier's necklace. . . .\" \n\nHe started with astonishment. \n\n\"What! . . . Impossible!\" \n\nThey searched in the folds of her dress, in the folds of the coat, in the pockets, everywhere. They could not find it. \n\n\"Are you sure that you still had it on when you came away from the ball?\" he asked. \n\n\"Yes, I touched it in the hall at the Ministry.\" \n\n\"But if you had lost it in the street, we should have heard it fall.\" \n\n\"Yes. Probably we should. Did you take the number of the cab?\" \n\n\"No. You didn't notice it, did you?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\nThey stared at one another, dumbfounded. At last Loisel put on his clothes again. \n\n\"I'll go over all the ground we walked,\" he said, \"and see if I can't find it.\" \n\nAnd he went out. She remained in her evening clothes, lacking strength to get into bed, huddled on a chair, without volition or power of thought. \n\nHer husband returned about seven. He had found nothing. \n\nHe went to the police station, to the newspapers, to offer a reward, to the cab companies, everywhere that a ray of hope impelled him. \n\nShe waited all day long, in the same state of bewilderment at this fearful catastrophe. \n\nLoisel came home at night, his face lined and pale; he had discovered nothing. \n\n\"You must write to your friend,\" he said, \"and tell her that you've broken the clasp of her necklace and are getting it mended. That will give us time to look about us.\" \n\nShe wrote at his dictation. \n\n*\n\nBy the end of a week they had lost all hope. \n\nLoisel, who had aged five years, declared: \"We must see about replacing the diamonds.\" \n\nNext day they took the box which had held the necklace and went to the jewellers whose name was inside. He consulted his books. \n\n\"It was not I who sold this necklace, Madame; I must have merely supplied the clasp.\" \n\nThen they went from jeweller to jeweller, searching for another necklace like the first, consulting their memories, both ill with remorse and anguish of mind. \n\nIn a shop at the Palais-Royal they found a string of diamonds which seemed to them exactly like the one they were looking for. It was worth forty thousand francs. They were allowed to have it for thirty-six thousand. They begged the jeweller not to sell it for three days. And they arranged matters on the understanding that it would be taken back for thirty-four thousand francs, if the first one were found before the end of February. Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs left to him by his father. He intended to borrow the rest. \n\nHe did borrow it, getting a thousand from one man, five hundred from another, five louis here, three louis there. He gave notes of hand, entered into ruinous agreements, did business with usurers and the whole tribe of money-lenders. He mortgaged the whole remaining years of his existence, risked his signature without even knowing if he could honour it, and, appalled at the agonising face of the future, at the black misery about to fall upon him, at the prospect of every possible physical privation and moral torture, he went to get the new necklace and put down upon the jeweller's counter thirty-six thousand francs. \n\nWhen Madame Loisel took back the necklace to Madame Forestier, the latter said to her in a chilly voice: \"You ought to have brought it back sooner; I might have needed it.\" \n\nShe did not, as her friend had feared, open the case. If she had noticed the substitution, what would she have thought? What would she have said? Would she not have taken her for a thief? \n\n*\n\nMadame Loisel came to know the ghastly life of abject poverty. From the very first she played her part heroically. This fearful debt must be paid off. She would pay it. The servant was dismissed. They changed their flat; they took a garret under the roof. \n\nShe came to know the heavy work of the house, the hateful duties of the kitchen. She washed the plates, wearing out her pink nails on the coarse pottery and the bottoms of pans. She washed the dirty linen, the shirts and dish-cloths, and hung them out to dry on a string; every morning she took the dustbin down into the street and carried up the water, stopping on each landing to get her breath. And, clad like a poor woman, she went to the fruiterer, to the grocer, to the butcher, a basket on her arm, haggling, insulted, fighting for every wretched halfpenny of her money. \n\nEvery month notes had to be paid off, others renewed, time gained. \n\nHer husband worked in the evenings at putting straight a merchant's accounts, and often at night he did copying at twopence-halfpenny a page. \n\nAnd this life lasted ten years. \n\nAt the end of ten years everything was paid off, everything, the usurer's charges and the accumulation of superimposed interest. \n\nMadame Loisel looked old now. She had become like all the other strong, hard, coarse women of poor households. Her hair was badly done, her skirts were awry, her hands were red. She spoke in a shrill voice, and the water slopped all over the floor when she scrubbed it. But sometimes, when her husband was at the office, she sat down by the window and thought of that evening long ago, of the ball at which she had been so beautiful and so much admired. \n\nWhat would have happened if she had never lost those jewels. Who knows? Who knows? How strange life is, how fickle! How little is needed to ruin or to save! \n\nOne Sunday, as she had gone for a walk along the Champs-Elysees to freshen herself after the labours of the week, she caught sight suddenly of a woman who was taking a child out for a walk. It was Madame Forestier, still young, still beautiful, still attractive. \n\nMadame Loisel was conscious of some emotion. Should she speak to her? Yes, certainly. And now that she had paid, she would tell her all. Why not? \n\nShe went up to her. \n\n\"Good morning, Jeanne.\" \n\nThe other did not recognise her, and was surprised at being thus familiarly addressed by a poor woman. \"But . . . Madame . . .\" she stammered. \"I don't know . . . you must be making a mistake.\" \n\n\"No . . . I am Mathilde Loisel.\" \n\nHer friend uttered a cry. \n\n\"Oh! . . . my poor Mathilde, how you have changed! . . .\" \n\n\"Yes, I've had some hard times since I saw you last; and many sorrows . . . and all on your account.\" \n\n\"On my account! . . . How was that?\" \n\n\"You remember the diamond necklace you lent me for the ball at the Ministry?\" \n\n\"Yes. Well?\" \n\n\"Well, I lost it.\" \n\n\"How could you? Why, you brought it back.\" \n\n\"I brought you another one just like it. And for the last ten years we have been paying for it. You realise it wasn't easy for us; we had no money. . . . Well, it's paid for at last, and I'm glad indeed.\" \n\nMadame Forestier had halted. \n\n\"You say you bought a diamond necklace to replace mine?\" \n\n\"Yes. You hadn't noticed it? They were very much alike.\" \n\nAnd she smiled in proud and innocent happiness. \n\nMadame Forestier, deeply moved, took her two hands. \n\n\"Oh, my poor Mathilde! But mine was imitation. It was worth at the very most five hundred francs! . . . \""

      "body": "The Cockroach Theory For Self Development:\n\nAt a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and sat on a lady.\n\nShe started screaming out of fear.\n\nWith a panic stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.\n\nHer reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.\n\nThe lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but… it landed on another lady in the group.\n\nNow, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.\n\nThe waiter rushed forward to their rescue. In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.\n\nThe waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt. When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.\n\nSipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach responsible for their histrionic behavior?\n\nIf so, then why was the waiter not disturbed? He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.\n\nIt is not the cockroach, but the inability of those people to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach, that disturbed the ladies.\n\nI realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it’s my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.\n\nIt’s not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.\n\nMore than the problem, it’s my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life."

He caught the hare, but with some hesitation as he knew the hare wouldn’t fill him up.\n\nAs the lion was about to kill the hare, he spotted a deer coming his way and thought, “Instead of eating this small hare, let me eat that big deer.”\n\nSo he let the hare go and went after the deer, but it vanished in the forest. The lion now had nothing to eat as the hare was also long gone.\n\nMoral of the story: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."

The farmer complained.. \"Who could be so careless as to leave such a big stone on the road? Why does someone not remove it?\" He went away complaining.\n\nThe next day, the same thing happened with a milkman. He too went away grumbling but left the stone as it was.\nThen one day, a student came across the stone. Worried that someone may fall over it and hurt himself, he decided to push it aside.

Inside was written, \"You are the true wealth of this nation.\"\nThere are two kinds of people \nTalkers and doers.\nTalkers merely talk, while doers do.\n\nMoral of the story: If you don't want to get involved you have no right to criticize  become the change you wish to see in this world.\nService to society is the rent we pay for the space we occupy on this earth."

      "body": "What Do We Really Want In Life?:\n\nThe American businessman was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna.\n\nThe American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them. The Mexican replied only a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish.\n\nThe Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs.\n\nThe American then asked, “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”\n\nThe Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siesta with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos, I have a full and busy life, senor.”\n\nThe American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually NYC where you will run your expanding enterprise.”\n\nThe Mexican fisherman asked, “But senor, how long will this all take?” To which the American replied, 15-20 years.\n\n“But what then, senor?”\n\nThe American laughed and said “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions.”\n\n“Millions, senor then what?”\n\nThe American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar.”\n\nMoral of the Story:\n\nToo often we run around chasing things, we don’t know what our aim in life is. Satisfaction can be found in the simplest form of life."

      "body": "The Secret Of Work:\n\nOnce upon a time there lived a king in southern India named Sri Rana Charya. He was very curious to know about his village. \n\nOne day he called out a group of courtiers and said, “Go, and find how the people of my village are and bring the person who knows about the secret of work. But one condition, any person you meet, he should not know that I sent you.\" \n\nThe courtiers didn’t understand the king and they walked away. The courtiers thought about what to do the whole night, each of them got a plan and they said to each other. But all the members liked the plan of Raghu (a clever person among the other courtiers) and they all agreed to it. \n\nThe very next day they all dressed as Tribals and they arranged a bullock cart with them and they went around. \n\nFirst they saw a woodcutter who was cutting down trees they went to him and said “Do you like this job sir?\" \n\nThe woodcutter replied “No, I do it because this work comes from our ancestors so I was forced by my parents to do this job\". \n\nThe courtiers said goodbye to the woodcutter and walked away. \n\nWhile traveling further, the courtiers saw an angry washer man and they decided to talk to him. \n\nOne of them asked “Hello sir! We come from East India and we are new to this place, we’ve come to visit our friend Ram who lives here somewhere nearby could you please tell his address\". \n\nThe washer man said “Are you mad? Can’t you see what I am doing? I am doing an idiotic job.\" \n\nThe courtiers asked him “Sir, Do you like this job?\" \n\nThe washer man continued angrily “No, when I was small I did not show much interest in studies and I never listened to my parents so, I became a washer man, as I should look after my family and earn a living. To feed them I do this job\". \n\nThe courtiers apologized for disturbing and went away. \n\nThen they made up their minds to leave the job and send a message to the king that no one in the village knows about the secret of work. \n\nBut suddenly, they saw a small hut with 5 candles and 3 lamps and a man studying a science book and one of them said that it is a school. They went inside and asked the lecturer the same question. \n\nThe lecturer replied “I love this job and it gives me satisfaction and happiness teaching so many uneducated children\". \n\nHearing this the courtiers took the lecturer to the king and the king appreciated him for knowing the secret of work and soon he became the best teacher in the village and was given an award and soon a big school was built. \n\nMoral: Any work you do it does not matter, but you have to have some interest in that. If you want to achieve greater heights, believe in yourself. And then you can know that \n\n“Work is worship.\""

On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, “How was the trip?”\n\n“It was great, Dad.”\n\n“Did you see how poor people live?” the father asked.\n\n“Oh yeah,” said the son.\n\n“So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?” asked the father.\n\nThe son answered, “I saw that we have one dog and they had four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden, and they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden, and they have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard, and they have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to live on, and they have fields that go beyond our sight. We have servants who serve us, but they serve others. We buy our food, but they grow theirs. We have walls around our property to protect us; they have friends to protect them.”\n\nThe boy’s father was speechless.\n\nThen his son added, “Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are.”"

Their personalities were very different, and Li-Li was angered by many of her mother-in-law’s habits. In addition, she criticized Li-Li constantly.\n\nDays passed days, and weeks passed weeks. Li-Li and her mother-in-law never stopped arguing and fighting. But what made the situation even worse was that, according to ancient Chinese tradition, Li-Li had to bow to her mother-in-law and obey her every wish. All the anger and unhappiness in the house was causing the poor husband great distress.\n\nFinally, Li-Li could not stand her mother-in-law’s bad temper and dictatorship any longer, and she decided to do something about it.\n\nLi-Li went to see her father’s good friend, Mr. Huang, who sold herbs. She told him the situation and asked if he would give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all. Mr. Huang thought for a while, and finally said, “Li-Li, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and obey what I tell you.”\n\nLi-Li said, “Yes, Mr. Huang, I will do whatever you tell me to do.” Mr. Huang went into the back room, and returned in a few minutes with a package of herbs.\n\nHe told Li-Li, “You can’t use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day prepare some delicious meal and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, in order to make sure that nobody suspects you when she dies, you must be very careful to act very friendly towards her. Don’t argue with her, obey her every wish, and treat her like a queen.”\n\nLi-Li was so happy. She thanked Mr. Huang and hurried home to start her plot of murdering her mother-in-law.\n\nWeeks went by, months went by, and every other day, Li-Li served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She remembered what Mr. Huang had said about avoiding suspicion, so she controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother. After six months had passed, the whole household had changed.\n\nLi-Li had practiced controlling her temper so much that she found that she almost never got mad or upset. She hadn’t had an argument in six months with her mother-in-law, who now seemed much kinder and easier to get along with.\n\nThe mother-in-law’s attitude toward Li-Li changed, and she began to love Li-Li like her own daughter. She kept telling friends and relatives that Li-Li was the best daughter-in-law one could ever find. Li-Li and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter.\n\nLi-Li’s husband was very happy to see what was happening.\n\nOne day, Li-Li came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again. She said, “Mr. Huang, please help me to stop the poison from killing my mother-in-law! She’s changed into such a nice woman, and I love her like my own mother. I do not want her to die because of the poison I gave her.”\n\nMr. Huang smiled and nodded his head. “Li-Li, there’s nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to improve her health. The only poison was in your mind and your attitude toward her, but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her.”\n\nAuthor Unknown"

As he strolled along the beach, he could see a man going back and forth between the surf’s edge and the beach. As he approached the man, he noticed that he was throwing starfishes to the sea. The man noticed hundreds of starfish stranded on the sand brought by the tides.\n\nThe man was stuck by the apparent vanity of the task. There were hundreds of starfish on the beach and many of them were sure to perish as the sun grew stronger by the day. But the man continued the task of picking up a starfish one by one and throwing them into the sea.\n\n“I must ask, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?”  he asked as he approached the man throwing the starfish.\n\nThe  man replied, “The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw them in, they’ll die soon.”\n\nObserving the frugality of the task, the man said, “ There are thousands of starfish stranded on the beach. There is no way you can throw all of them back to the surf. You can’t possibly make a difference.” The person looked at the man, stooped down and picked up one more starfish and threw it as far as he could into the ocean.  He turned back to the man and replied: “It surely made a difference to that one!”\n\nOften we get overwhelmed by the challenges of the world as it seems to be humongous and unconquerable. We may feel like our actions are trivial. But this should not stop us from our attempt to create positive change in the world. We often forget and ignore the impact of our actions on the world. Sometimes even our tiniest act of kindness may be affecting someone in a great way.\n\nHope these inspirational short stories charged your spirit, helped you to gain a new perspective in your life or at least made you smile."

      "body": "What Goes Around Comes Around:\n\nOne day a man saw an old lady, stranded on the side of the road, but even in the dim light of day, he could see she needed help. So he pulled up in front of her Mercedes and got out. His Pontiac was still sputtering when he approached her.\n\nEven with the smile on his face, she was worried. No one had stopped to help for the last hour or so. Was he going to hurt her? He didn’t look safe; he looked poor and hungry. He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. It was those chills which only fear can put in you. He said, “I’m here to help you, ma’am. Why don’t you wait in the car where it’s warm? By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson.”\n\nWell, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt.\n\nAs he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and was only just passing through. She couldn’t thank him enough for coming to her aid.\n\nBryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her. She already imagined all the awful things that could have happened had he not stopped. Bryan never thought twice about being paid. This was not a job to him. This was helping someone in need, and God knows there were plenty, who had given him a hand in the past. He had lived his whole life that way, and it never occurred to him to act any other way.\n\nHe told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Bryan added, “And think of me.”\n\nHe waited until she started her car and drove off. It had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt good as he headed for home, disappearing into the twilight.\n\nA few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to grab a bite to eat, and take the chill off before she made the last leg of her trip home. It was a dingy looking restaurant. Outside were two old gas pumps. The whole scene was unfamiliar to her.\n\n The waitress came over and brought a clean towel to wipe her wet hair. She had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for the whole day couldn’t erase. The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant, but she never let the strain and aches change her attitude. The old lady wondered how someone who had so little could be so giving to a stranger. Then she remembered Bryan.\n\nAfter the lady finished her meal, she paid with a hundred dollar bill. The waitress quickly went to get change for her hundred dollar bill, but the old lady had slipped right out the door. She was gone by the time the waitress came back. The waitress wondered where the lady could be. Then she noticed something written on the napkin.\n\nThere were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady wrote: “You don’t owe me anything. I have been there too. Somebody once helped me out, the way I’m helping you. If you really want to pay me back, here is what you do, do not let this chain of love end with you.” Under the napkin were four more $100 bills.\n\nWell, there were tables to clear, sugar bowls to fill, and people to serve, but the waitress made it through another day. That night when she got home from work and climbed into bed, she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. How could the lady have known how much she and her husband needed it? With the baby due next month, it was going to be hard… \n\nShe knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she gave him a soft kiss and whispered soft and low, “Everything’s going to be all right. I love you, Bryan Anderson.”\n\nThere is an old saying “What goes around comes around.”\n\nAuthor: Unknown"
