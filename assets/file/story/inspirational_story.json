      "title": "The Elephant Rope",
      "body": "A gentleman was walking through an elephant camp, and he spotted that the elephants weren’t being kept in cages or held by the use of chains.\n\nAll that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs.\n\nAs the man gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the elephants didn’t just use their strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead, they didn’t try to at all.\n\nCurious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to escape.\n\nThe trainer replied;\n\n“when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”\n\nThe only reason that the elephants weren’t breaking free and escaping from the camp was that over time they adopted the belief that it just wasn’t possible.\n\nMoral of the story:\nNo matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible. Believing you can become successful is the most important step in actually achieving it."

      "body": "In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner’s daughter.\n\nHe decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman’s daughter.\n\nNeedless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.\n\nThe loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.\n\nThe daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn’t have to marry the loan-shark.\n\nStanding on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman’s garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.\n\nWhilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he’d picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag.\n\nHe then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.\n\nThe daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:\n\nRefuse to pick a pebble from the bag.\nTake both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.\nPick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father’s freedom.\nShe drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it ‘accidentally’ dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;\n\n“Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.”\n\nThe pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn’t want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father’s debt.\n\nMoral of the story:\nIt’s always possible to overcome a tough situation throughout of the box thinking, and not give in to the only options you think you have to pick from."

That they would never make it out.\n\nEventually, one of the frogs took heed to what the others were saying and he gave up, falling down to his death. The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Again, the crowd of frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die.\n\nHe jumped even harder and finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear us?”\n\nThe frog explained to them that he was deaf.

Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to push the stone out of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.\n\nAfter the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been.\n\nThe purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King explaining that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.\n\nMoral of the story:\nEvery obstacle we come across in life gives us an opportunity to improve our circumstances, and whilst the lazy complain, the others are creating opportunities through their kind hearts, generosity, and willingness to get things done."

He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.\n\nUntil it suddenly stopped making any progress and looked like it was stuck.\n\nSo the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.\n\nThe man didn’t think anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. But that didn’t happen. The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with tiny wings and a swollen body.\n\nDespite the kind heart of the man, he didn’t understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the small opening; were God’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was out of the cocoon.\n\nMoral of the story:\nOur struggles in life develop our strengths. Without struggles, we never grow and never get stronger, so it’s important for us to tackle challenges on our own, and not be relying on help from others."

His father decided to hand him a bag of nails and said that every time the boy lost his temper, he had to hammer a nail into the fence.\n\nOn the first day, the boy hammered 37 nails into that fence.\n\nThe boy gradually began to control his temper over the next few weeks, and the number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased.\n\nHe discovered it was easier to control his temper than to hammer those nails into the fence.\n\nFinally, the day came when the boy didn’t lose his temper at all. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day he kept his temper under control.\n\nThe days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence.\n\n“you have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same.

Out of the kennel came Lady, who ran down the aisle of his shop followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.\n\nOne puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said, “What’s wrong with that little dog?”\n\nThe shop owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didn’t have a hip socket.

That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I’ll pay full price. In fact, I’ll give you $2.37 now, and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for.”\n\nThe shop owner countered, “You really don’t want to buy this little dog. He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies.”\n\nTo his surprise, the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.

The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three months of training the master had taught him only one move. \"Sensei,\"(Teacher in Japanese) the boy finally said, \"Shouldn't I be learning more moves?\" \"This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,\" the sensei replied.\n\nNot quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training. Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.\n\nThis time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened. \"No,\" the sensei insisted, \"Let him continue.\" Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament.\n\nHe was the champion. On the way home, the boy and sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind.\n\n\"Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?\"\n\n\"You won for two reasons,\" the sensei answered. \"First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. And second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.\"\n\nThe boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.\n\nMoral: Sometimes we feel that we have certain weaknesses and we blame God, the circumstances or ourselves for it but we never know that our weaknesses can become our strengths one day.

He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events to raise money for youth at risk programs.\n\nThe last time I was there he introduced me by saying, \"I want to tell you why I let Jack use my horse. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.\n\n\"That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.\n\n\"He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, `See me after class.'\n\n\"The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, `Why did I receive an F?'\n\n\"The teacher said, `This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, `If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'\n\n\"The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, `Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.' \"Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all.\n\nHe stated, \"You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.\"\n\nMonty then turned to the assembled group and said, \"I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace.\" He added, \"The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week.\" When the teacher was leaving, he said, \"Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up on yours.\"\n\nMoral: Don't let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what. No Dream is too big or too small when one works hard to live it. One should always try making dreams come true no matter what."

      "body": "A Mouse running over his face awakened a Lion from sleep. Rising up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him. Then the Mouse piteously entreated, saying:\n\n\"If you would only spare my life, I would be sure to repay your kindness.\" The Lion laughed at him but allowed him go. It happened shortly after this that some hunters, who bound him by strong ropes to the ground, caught the Lion. The Mouse, recognizing his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free, exclaiming:\n\n\"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, never expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor, Now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion.\"\n\nMoral: It is possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion."

      "title": "The Praying Hands",
      "body": "Back in the fifteenth century, in a tiny village near Nuremberg, lived a family with eighteen children. Eighteen! In order merely to keep food on the table for this mob, the father and head of the household, a goldsmith by profession, worked almost eighteen hours a day at his trade and any other paying chore he could find in the neighborhood. Despite their seemingly hopeless condition, two of Albrecht Durer the Elder's children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art, but they knew full well that their father would never be financially able to send either of them to Nuremberg to study at the Academy.\n\nAfter many long discussions at night in their crowded bed, the two boys finally worked out a pact. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother while he attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy, either with sales of his artwork or, if necessary, also by laboring in the mines.\n\nThey tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won the toss and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was almost an immediate sensation. Albrecht's etchings, his woodcuts, and his oils were far better than those of most of his professors, and by the time he graduated, he was beginning to earn considerable fees for his commissioned works.\n\nWhen the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner on their lawn to celebrate Albrecht's triumphant homecoming. After a long and memorable meal, punctuated with music and laughter, Albrecht rose from his honored position at the head of the table to drink a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled Albrecht to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, \"And now, Albert, blessed brother of mine, now it is your turn. Now you can go to Nuremberg to pursue your dream, and I will take care of you.\"\n\nAll heads turned in eager expectation to the far end of the table where Albert sat, tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side while he sobbed and repeated, over and over, \"No ...no ...no ...no.\"\n\nFinally, Albert rose and wiped the tears from his cheeks. He glanced down the long table at the faces he loved, and then, holding his hands close to his right cheek, he said softly, \"No, brother. I cannot go to Nuremberg. It is too late for me. Look ... look what four years in the mines have done to my hands! The bones in every finger have been smashed at least once, and lately I have been suffering from arthritis so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less make delicate lines on parchment or canvas with a pen or a brush. No, brother ... for me it is too late.\"\n\nMore than 450 years have passed. By now, Albrecht Durer's hundreds of masterful portraits, pen and silver-point sketches, watercolors, charcoals, woodcuts, and copper engravings hang in every great museum in the world, but the odds are great that you, like most people, are familiar with only one of Albrecht Durer's works. More than merely being familiar with it, you very well may have a reproduction hanging in your home or office.\n\nOne day, to pay homage to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply \"Hands,\" but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed his tribute of love \"The Praying Hands.\"\n\nMora: The next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one - no one - ever makes it alone!"

      "title": "The White Elephant",
      "body": "Once upon a time, there lived a herd of eighty thousand elephants at the bottom of the majestic Himalayas. Their leader was a magnificent and rare white elephant who was an extremely kind-hearten soul. He greatly loved his mother who had grown blind and feeble and could not look out for herself.\n\nEach day this white elephant would go deep into the forest in search of food. He would look for the best of wild fruit to send to his mother. But alas, his mother never received any. This was because his messengers would always eat them up themselves. Each night, when he returned home he would be surprised to hear that his mother had been starving all day. He was absolutely disgusted with his herd.\n\nThen one day, he decided to leave them all behind and disappeared in the middle of the night along with his dear mother. He took her to Mount Candorana to live in a cave beside a beautiful lake that was covered by gorgeous pink lotuses.\n\nIt so happened that one day, when the white elephant was feeding he heard loud cries. A forester from Benaras had lost his way in the forest and was absolutely terrified. He had come to the area to visit relatives and could not find his way out.\n\nOn seeing this big white elephant he was even more terrified and ran as fast as he could. The elephant followed him and told him not to be afraid, as all he wanted to do was to help him. He asked the forester why he was crying so bitterly. The forester replied that he was crying because he had been roaming the forest for the past seven days and could not find his way out.\n\nThe elephant told him not to worry as he knew every inch of this forest and could take him to safety. He then lifted him on to his back and carried him to the edge of the forest from where the forester went on his merry way back to Benaras.\n\nOn reaching the city, he heard that King Brahmadutta's personal elephant had just died and the King was looking for a new elephant. His heralds were roaming the city, announcing that any man who had seen or heard of an elephant fit for a King should come forward with the information.\n\nThe forester was very excited and immediately went up to the King and told him about the white elephant that he had seen on Mount Candorana. He told him that he had marked the way and would require the help of the elephant trainers in order to catch this fantastic elephant.\n\nThe King was quite pleased with the information and immediately dispatched a number of soldiers and elephant trainers along with the forester. After travelling for many days, the group reached the lake besides which the elephants resided. They slowly moved down to the edge of the lake and hid behind the bushes. The white elephant was collecting lotus shoots for his mother's meal and could sense the presence of humans. When he looked up, he spotted the forester and realized that it was he who had led the King's men to him. He was very upset at the ingratitude but decided that if he put up a struggle many of the men would be killed. And he was just too kind to hurt anyone. So he decided to go along with them to Benaras and then request the benevolent King to be set free.\n\nThat night when the white elephant did not return home, his mother was very worried. She had heard all the commotion outside and had guessed that the King's men had taken away her son. She was scared that the King would ride him in to battle and her son would definitely be killed. She was also worried that there would be no one to look after her or even feed her, as she could not see. She just lay down and cried bitterly.\n\nMeanwhile her son was led in to the beautiful city of Benaras where he was given a grand reception. The whole city was decorated and his own stable was gaily painted and covered with garlands of fragrant flowers. The trainers laid out a feast for their new state elephant who refused to touch a morsel. He did not respond to any kind of stimuli, be it the fragrant flowers or the beautiful and comfortable stable. He just sat there looking completely despondent.\n\nThe worried trainers went straight to report the situation to their King, as they were scared that the elephant would just waste away without any food or water. The King was extremely concerned when he heard what they had to say and went to the stable himself. He offered the elephant food from the royal table and asked him why he grieved in this manner. He thought that the elephant should be proud and honored that he was chosen as the state elephant and would get the opportunity to serve his King.\n\nBut the white elephant replied that he would not eat a thing until he met his mother. So the King asked him where his mother was. The elephant replied that she was back home on Mount Candorana and must be worried and hungry as she was blind and had no one to feed her and take care of her. He was afraid that she would die.\n\nThe compassionate King was touched by the elephant's story and asked him to return to his blind, old mother and take care of her as he had been doing all along. He set him free in love and kindness. The happy elephant went running home as fast as he could. And he was relieved to find that his mother was still alive. He filled his trunk with water and poured it over his sick mother who thought that it was raining. Then she cried out as she thought that some evil spirit had come to harm her and wished and prayed that her son was there to save her.\n\nThe white elephant gently bent over his blind mother and stroked her lovingly. She immediately recognized his touch and was overjoyed. Her son lifted her up and told her that the kind and compassionate King of Benaras had set him free and he was here to love and look after his mother forever.\n\nHis mother was absolutely thrilled and blessed the kind King with peace, prosperity and joy till the end of his days. She was so thankful to him for sending her son back home. The white elephant was able to take good care of his mother till the day she died. And when he died himself, the King erected a statue of him by the side of the lake and held an annual elephant festival there in memory of such a caring and noble soul.\n\nMoral: Always give affection and care to our dear ones. Always respect other's feelings."

      "body": "The Brand New Wizard:\n\nValue: Patience\n\nSammy was a very impatient little wizard. He had been studying under the great wizardOrzo for a year and still could only do the simple tricks. How often he went to the baseof the mountain and saw Orzo go to the top where the lightning flashed about him as hecalled out the great spells that sent healing and miracles into the villages below.\n\nSammy knew there was one great spell that was so powerful; it would even defeat thegreat dragon Belial. But the most powerful spell he knew was just the word “IppidiBippidi” which he could use to make fire come from the end of a stick. And even thatwas hard to use because he kept burning up the stick, making the fire go into somethingwrong like his dog Ralph or it would shoot out the wrong end of the stick. Plus most ofthe time when Sammy use the spell “Ippidi Bippidi”, his pants fell down.\n\n“If you want to do great magic and such,” the great wizard laughed seeing hisperformance, “you will need to learn to keep your pants up each time.”\n\nSometimes Orzo took him on adventures as long as he promised to just mind the food andnot try to battle the great dragon before he was ready. And Sammy did as he was toldbecause while he was impatient, he was obedient to his master. In the last great battle,Sammy was able to get close and see the horrible dragon spewing hate and fire and liesand death at the villages and at Orzo. Sammy crept closer and closer to learn as much ashe could about how the great wizard defeated the evil one.\n\nSuddenly Orzo threw his hands into the air with his staff between them and looked upinto the sky above the dragon, the battle, the village and all else and said the mostpowerful magic word of the universe. The powerful spell created an eruption of powerfrom Orzo’s staff that sent the evil dragon flying in terror from the battle. Sammylistened closely and learned the word but he dared not say it. He hid it in his heart until itwas his time.\n\nPeace came to the land for a year and Sammy grew better at his duties. “Look master,”he ran into the chambers with Ralph, his dog right behind him. “I have gotten better atthe spell.” He said.\n\nHe held out his tiny stick which was his staff. Then squinting his eyes to concentrate hesaid the spell. “IPPIDI BIPPIDI” he said and he held his breath. Sure enough, a smallpillar of fire shot from the proper end and did not hit the dog. But the stick was a littleburnt at the end so it needed work. “See?” Sammy said thrusting out his chest proudlyand his pride might have lifted him from the ground. But then his pants fell down.\n\n“We have to get you better pants little wizard.” His master laughed but it was clear Orzowas pleased at the progress. “It takes great patience to become a great wizard but oneday I will teach you the master spell, the word that is above all words and can even defeatthe great dragon.” Orzo promised and Sammy didn’t have the courage to tell him he hadlearned the word but never breathed it.\n\nBelial struck without warning and this time on the home village of Sammy and Orzo.Before they had a chance to counter attack, the great evil was up on the town spreadingdevastation and death. Sammy and Orzo bolted from their beds hearing his terrible roarsand seeing his fiery breath exploding out in the village everywhere.\n\n“SAMMY, FIND MY STAFF!” Orzo commanded frantically as he gathered his gear totake the battle to the dragon. Together they shot out the door and out into the town. Assoon as they were into the courtyard, they stood at the feet of the great beast. Sammyknew this was bad because Orzo did his best war from the mountaintop, not down in thevalley where the village was.\n\n“HIDE SAMMY.” Orzo commanded. Sammy quickly found an overturned wagon tostay behind. The flames flew form Belial and from the mighty staff of Orzo as the fiercewar between good and evil took place right in the midst of mankind. Suddenly, Sammysaw a baby waddling out from its home nearby. The mommy was crying out in terror asshe watched her baby walking directly toward Belial.\n\nSammy moved without thinking. He dove and scooped up the baby and rolled with itback to the doorstep of the mommy. She cried loudly and snatched his baby and pulledher inside. Just then, Belial roared and fire shot out toward Sammy. Sammy rolled out ofthe way just in time. But when he turned over, he saw something that terrified him. Orzohad turned to watch Sammy save the baby and that distracted was all the enemy needed.Just as Orzo raised his staff to utter the word that is above all words, Belial’s clawslapped him to the ground. Orzo rolled over and over and came to rest injured andmoaning.\n\nSammy discovered courage inside him that he never knew was there. He reached downand grabbed the staff of his master and stepped into the clearing directly in front of thedemonic dragon. Just then, Orzo woke up but could not move for his injuries. “SAMMYNO!” he cried out. But Sammy somehow found the strength in side him. He lifted thestaff into the air in one hand.\n\n“IPPIDI BIPPIDI!” He spoke the only spell he had practiced. A tiny flame shot from thestaff and barely burnt the dragons toe. Instead of hurting him, that only made Belialangry. It rose up on its hind legs and roared in fierce fury rising high to bring his feetdown to destroy the village once and for all. Sammy decided he had to use the secretword he had learned, the word above every word. There was no time to learn it or waitfor Orzo to teach him. He lifted his staff up high over his head and grasped it in bothhands and then he shouted the words….\n\n‘IN THE NAME OF JESUS!” He spoke and the authority in his voice shattered the airand brought trembling to Sammy, the villagers and even to Orzo. Suddenly there wassilence. Belial froze in mid attack, unable to move. And then, as though he had beenexploded from the inside, his form just turned to mist and disappeared. The great evilwas defeated.\n\n“Am I in trouble for knowing the words?” Sammy asked his master as he helped himback to their home.\n\n“No, they are all words that all who serve our Lord should know. For He is the greatestwizard, not I and not you. And those words, well, that is the name that no evil can standagainst.” His master said reverently. “Because at the name of Jesus every knee shallbow, both on earth and under the earth and in heaven.” He said giving his apprentice aloving squeeze. “But you know what the best part is?” Orzo said\n\n“What master?” Sammy asked as Ralph barked and ran ahead into their home.“Well you finally learned to cast your great spells,” Orzo said with a laugh, “without yourpants falling down.”"

      "body": "The Beggar Prince:\n\nValue: The Lost\n\nExplanation to teachers and parents. I do not usually have to explain the theme of achildren’s story but this one may be misinterpreted. In this story of a prince who is lostfrom his kingdom, it might be easy to interpret the prince as being Jesus himself, the sonof the King who came to live with us on sinful earth. But that is not the intent of thisstory. The prince represents each of us as children of God who are not aware that ourfather is the King and deliberately do not enter into our inheritance and remain lost in thesqualor and poverty of sin. JM\n\n“THE SON OF THE KING IS LOST!” The cry went out from runners on horsebackwho galloped through every street, every village, every field and forest of the kingdomwith the terrible news. Young prince Roger was missing. The King was frantic to findhis only son. Posters showing his face were up on every tree and wall that could bear hisimage. The reward as more than most peasants could even count much less inherit andthe search for the child royalty was the all that the people of the kingdom could talkabout.\n\nEven in the beggar’s village, the anxiety for the lost prince was noticeable. While thepoor, the homeless, the sick and the outcasts that were citizens of this village were oftentoo absorbed with survival and finding safe and peaceful places to sleep and eat, thethought of their beloved prince being lost, stolen or dead was heartbreaking to them. Theprince was the darling of the kingdom. At only twelve, every boy wanted to be him,every girl his future bride and every parent his future in laws..\n\nGodfrey lived in the beggar village with his uncle Sven although he rarely saw his Unclebecause he was often off finding food for them or trying to get honest work. So Godfreyhad time in the village to make friends and even play, like the other boys and girls of richpeople could do. To a beggar a rich person is just someone with a real mom and dad, ahouse to live in, clothes that were clean and new, a school to go to and enough to eat notto mention presents at Christmas.\n\nGodfrey went down to the “playground” which was an area of the city that various boxes,tubes and broken toys that were thrown away by people who were not beggars threwaway were gathered for the children to play with during the day. Uncle Sven organizedthis playground so somebody made sure the things there were “safe” or as safe as aplayground in a beggars village could be. As Godfrey was trying to take apart a brokentool, he looked up and saw a boy he did not recognize. He walked over to introducehimself.\n\n“Hello, my name is Godfrey. Who are you?”\n\n“I don’t know.” The boy answered mysteriously.\n\n“What do you mean you don’t know? You know your name and who you live with don’tyou?” Godfrey objected.\n\n“No. I forgot everything. I don’t know my name and I don’t live with anyone. Someonefound me wandering on the streets of Kingdom City and they brought me here becausethey said beggars have to live here. I don’t think I have a name. I am not anybody.”\n\nGodfrey found this new boy very strange. Even beggars usually know who they are. Butinstead of being nosey, the boys just played together and became friends. They metevery day and made up games from the thrown away junk that was kept in the beggar’splayground. One day they were walking on the roads outside the beggar’s village whenGodfrey saw one of the signs for the lost prince. Instantly he stopped and stared.\n\n“What’s wrong, Godfrey” the boy with no name asked.\n\n“Look, there on the sign is a drawing of the Prince of the Kingdom who is lost. Look atit. That drawing looks just like you.” Both boys stared but the nameless boy could notsee it. It was clear as can be to Godfrey that the nameless boy looked exactly like PrinceRoger.\n\n“Well I am not Prince Roger.” The nameless boy objected. “Look at me. Do I look oract like a prince? If I had run away from the castle, wouldn’t I be in prince’s clothing?Wake up Godfrey. I don’t think there even is a Prince or a King or a Kingdom.\n\nEverybody is just rotting away in their own beggars villages every where.”\n\nHow could Godfrey get the lost and forgetful Prince Roger to look up and see who hereally is? He seemed so down, so lost, so convinced that the very real path to salvationand glories and riches just did not exist when Godfrey knew full well it did. The nextday, they were exploring unopened cans in the playground when Godfrey spotted aglimmer under the lost boy’s shirt.\n\n“Let me look at something.” He warned the nameless boy. “Don’t get nervous, I won’thurt you.” And he put his hand under the collar of his shirt and found a chain. Pulling itup there was a bright gold medallion hanging from the solid silver chain. “Look at this.Did you know this was there?” Godfrey asked.\n\n“No, it’s a surprise to me.” The boy answered.\n\n“Look at it. Its solid gold and the chain is silver. Look at the inscription. It says ‘To myprecious only son Roger’ and the symbol on it is the symbol of the King. Can’t you see?The King has put his mark on you that you will be his royal son forever and this mark cangive you your inheritance. We just have to get you back to the King.” Godfreyexplained with a voice that was both excited and full of compassion for the lost boy.\n\n“Well ok. I’ll play your little game if you want me to.” The lost prince finally concededbut not with very much conviction. Godfrey asked some people and found out how tomake his way to Kingdom City. He got a little food and the two beggar boys made theirway to the home of the King. Once there, Godfrey was able to find back alleys andpassageways to get the lost Prince to the gate of the palace. There he told his friend tojust walk into the courtyard and his friend did as he was asked to do.\n\n“IT’S THE PRINCE!” The hubbub went up like a riot. The excitement shot through thecastle and far off in the castle walls, Godfrey could hear the King shouting “MY SON?MY SON HAS COME BACK TO ME? BRING HIM TO ME?” and the love in thatfather’s voice almost made Godfrey cry. Godfrey repeated his route back out ofKingdom City and into the quiet Beggars village and went to the playground to think butwhen he got there, he was shocked at what he saw. There sat the royal King Roger, in hisold beggar’s clothes playing with a stone.\n\n“Why are you here?” Godfrey asked terribly upset that the prince was not at home withhis family. “You are Prince Roger. You should be on the throne, ruling the universewith your father.” He cried.\n\n“Godfrey, I appreciate your efforts but that was all just a game. There is no King, noKingdom and I am just a beggar, just like you.” He said and that depressed statement ofblindness to his royal inheritance upset Godfrey so much, he went home where his UncleSven was home at last from his work. Godfrey told his Uncle all about the Prince andhow they had traveled to the King but the Prince just could not understand hisinheritance.\n\n“Well it’s like all of us sometimes, Godfrey.” Uncle Sven said lovingly. “We are allChildren of God and are heirs to His vast fortunes. The cattle of every hill are His andHe want us to live in his love and joy but so many times we live in sin and poverty,refusing to see the wealth that is already ours. Go and get the young prince. We willfeed him and care for him and pray for him that God will open his eyes to who he reallyis, the son of the most high King.”\n\nGodfrey did that and along the way he prayed for himself and the other beggars and forall of us that all of us would understand who we really are, the children of the Master ofthe Universe and the sons and daughters of a God who will give all to us, if we will justlive with him and let him live in us."

      "body": "Keeping The Roots Stronger:\n\nOnce upon a time, there were two neighbors living next to each other. One of them was a retired teacher and another was an insurance agent who had a lot of interest in technology. Both of them had planted different plants in their garden. The retired teacher was giving a small amount of water to his plants and didn’t always give a full attention to them, while the other neighbor interested in technology, had given a lot of water to his plants and looked after them too well.\n\nThe retired teacher’s plants were simple but looked good. The insurance agent’s plants were much fuller and greener. One day, during the night, there was a heavy rain and a wind due to a minor storm. Next morning, both of the neighbors came out to inspect the damage to their garden. The neighbor who was an insurance agent saw that his plants came off from the roots and were totally destroyed. But, the retired teacher’s plants were not damaged at all and were standing firm.\n\nThe insurance agent neighbor was surprised to see it, he went to the retired teacher and asked, “We both grew the same plants together, I actually looked after my plants better than you did for yours, and even gave them more water. Still, my plants came off from the roots, while yours didn’t. How is that possible?”\n\nThe retired teacher smiled and said, “You gave your plants more attention and water, but because of that they didn’t need to work themselves for it.  You made it easy for them.  While I gave them just an adequate amount of water and let their roots search for more.   And, because of that, their roots went deeper and that made their position stronger.  That is why my plants survived”.\n\nMoral:  This story is about parenting where children are like plants.  If everything is given to them, they will not understand the hard work it takes to earn those things.  They will not learn to work themselves and respect it.  Sometimes it’s best to guide them instead of giving them.   Teach them how to walk, but let them follow their path."

I laud the morning thoughts that keep my spirit strong, Then close my eyes, and visualize an unknown heaven on earth; I see the flowers bloom, the sun-rise, and the sky pervading in the sound of birds. \n\nKissed by the soft breeze, I open my eyes, It’s serene everywhere in the environment so blessed, And I still hear the soft words of the song of my soul."

We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden; they have the stars. Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.”\n\nWhen the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless. His son added, “Thanks Dad for showing me how poor we are!”\n\nOur outlook on life depends on the way we look at things.

      "body": "\nValue: Lying\n\nLots of us have imaginary friends. John had one and he talked to him every day. John’simaginary friend was named Duncan. Since John was an only child, he had lots of timefor Duncan. Whenever mom and dad were too busy, he and Duncan made up lots of fungames together. They would play in the yard and turn it into a wonderful forest full ofwild imaginary creatures. Sometimes they were spacemen fighting the evil Lord Gnulleand his army of mutants. Duncan and John always won. Other times Duncan would justget in his jammies and watch movies with John and make funny remarks about the adults.One day John and Duncan were working on a fort in a part of the yard where nobody everwent. Duncan had already talked John into taking scrap wood from building sites near byeven though John didn’t really feel ok about it. “Go ahead.” Duncan said. “Look, theyhave so much wood. They won’t miss a few boards.” John never let himself he hadstolen the boards and Duncan said was ok so he took them.\n\nAt home, he got busy building the fort. Duncan said it was ok to use John’s daddy’s toolsbecause they both knew that John’s daddy wanted John to learn to use tools so this was aperfect way. Suddenly as he worked, John cut his finger. It was bleeding pretty badly sohe ran crying into the house to have mommy fix it. As mommy was putting the band-aidon she asked, “How did you cut your finger John?”\n\n“Don’t tell her it was on your daddy’s saw.” Duncan whispered. “Tell her you cut itstacking firewood.”\n\n“But that’s a lie.” John answered his friend. Mommy didn’t see the chat happeningbecause parents can’t see what happens with your imaginary friend.\n\n“Don’t worry. I have a magic dust and I will throw it on her to turn the lie into the truth.”Duncan whispered.\n\n“I cut it stacking up some of the firewood like you wanted me to do mommy.” John saidfeeling really guilty inside and just then, he saw Duncan blow the magic dust.\n\n“Well, I am glad you were doing something good sweetie.” Mommy said. “Just try to bemore careful next time.”\n\nWow it had worked. John’s mom really did believe it and when she did, it almost made ittrue. Well at least until John went back to building his fort and saw the blood on the saw.So he cleaned it up then the lie became the truth. Duncan and John worked all afternoonbut as suppertime came close, it looked like rain.\n\n“We better go in and tell mommy what we want for supper.” Duncan recommended. “Iwant macaroni and cheese.” He cheered which seemed odd to John because imaginaryfriends don’t eat.\n\n“Ok, we better put daddy’s tools up or I will get caught and be in big trouble.” John toldDuncan.\n\n“Oh leave them.” Duncan said. “We will need them tomorrow to finish the fort and thisway it won’t take so long getting them out. Anyway, daddy never uses them during theweek so we can clean up on Friday.” So John listened to Duncan and left the tools out.He thought about it later when he was watching TV with his parents and it started to rainbut it was too late to run out there now and daddy would know for sure. Then, just likeDuncan said, they used the tools the next day and everything was fine.\n\nSaturday daddy found the tools. He called John into the garage. “John, did you play withmy tools and leave them out?” daddy said holding his favorite saw. “See? It’s rusting.Was it out when it rained that night?”\n\n“Tell him no.” Duncan whispered. “Tell him that he left them out the last time heworked on the fence and that you found them and put them up for him.”\n\n“But that’s a lie!” John objected to his imaginary friend.\n\n“I will use my magic dust to make it the truth like we did before.” Duncan reassuredhim. So John said what Duncan wanted him to and when he finished the lie, he heardDuncan blow the magic dust. Daddy stared at John like he could see right through him.John even saw daddy’s eyes shift like he could actually see Duncan and John got reallyscared. If daddy has magic and knows about Duncan, he will be in big trouble.\n\n“Ok John, we will talk about it later.” Daddy said.\n\n“We did it!” Duncan said triumphantly. “The magic dust worked and changed the lieinto the truth.” John still felt really bad in his spirit and the play that day was not so fun.“John lets talk about the tools.” John’s daddy said coming into his bedroom and sittingon the bed. Then he did something John didn’t expect. He picked John up and huggedhim and let him sit on his lap. “Now, you have always been an honest boy and you knowyou can tell me the truth no matter what, don’t you?”\n\n“Yes daddy.” John said feeling himself close to tears. “Daddy, I left the tools out. I liedto you in the garage.” He said sniffling a bit.\n\n“NO DON’T TELL HIM THAT. WHAT ABOUT OUR SECRETS?” Duncancomplained loudly but John didn’t listen.\n\n“Who taught you to lie like that?” John’s daddy asked.\n\n“My imaginary friend Duncan.” John said feeling much better getting it out.“John, remember in the Bible where the serpent convinced Eve to lie? Well that serpentwas kind of like Duncan because Eve hid things from those she loved, first her husbandand then God. But God can see in our hearts and knows when we lie because nothing ishidden from him. God knows you and Duncan used lies to cover up things.” Daddy saidholding John so he felt safe even though he was being corrected.\n\n“Yes daddy I know. I have felt awful about it all day.” John confessed.\n\n“Well, the Bible teaches us not to listen to spirits that make us sin. If Duncan is makingyou sin then its time he either met the Lord or you got a new imaginary friend. Maybeone that goes to our church.” Daddy said and then he prayed with John and Johnrepented of lying and of listening to a spirit that told him to sin. He hopped down fromdaddy’s knee and ran out to have a snack with mommy.\n\n“Oh and John?” His daddy said standing up from the bed. “Tell Duncan his magic dustdoesn’t work because I could see him blowing it the whole time.” He said and John’sjaw dropped.\n\n“You could see Duncan? And you knew about the dust?” he gasped. “How much canmommies and daddies see?” he gasped.\n\n“You never know John.” Daddy said chuckling. “You just never know."

      "body": "A Blank Question Paper:\n\nOne day a professor entered the classroom and asked his students to prepare for a surprise test.  They waited anxiously at their desks for the test to begin.  The professor handed out the question paper with the text facing down as usual.  Once he handed them all out, he asked his students to turn the page and begin.  To everyone’s surprise, there were no questions, just a black dot in the center of the page.\n\nThe professor seeing the expression on everyone’s face, told them the following, “I want you to write what you see there.”  The confused students got started on the inexplicable task.  At the end of the class, the professor took all the answer papers and started reading each one of them aloud in front of all the students.  All of them with no exceptions described the black dot, trying to explain its position in the middle of the sheet etc.\n\nAfter all had been read, the classroom was silent.  The professor began to explain, “I am not going to grade on you this, I just wanted to give you something to think about.  No one wrote about the white part of the paper.  Everyone focused on the black dot and the same happens in our lives.  We have a white paper to observe and enjoy, but we always focus on the dark spots.  Our life is a gift given to us by God with love and care.  We always have reasons to celebrate, nature renewing itself every day, our friends around us, the job that provides our livelihood, the miracles we see every day.”\n\n“However, we insist on focusing only on the dark spots, the health issues that bother us, the lack of money, the complicated relationship with a family member, the disappointment with a friends etc.  The dark spots are very small compared to everything we have in our lives, but they are the ones that pollute our minds.  Take your eyes away from the black spots in your life.  Enjoy each one of your blessings, each moment that life gives you.  Be happy and live a life positively!”\n\nMoral: As the professor explained, life is a bag of good and bad things, we all have positives and negatives along the way.  But we must always concentrate greater on the positives for a healthy and happy life.  Life goes on no matter what so do not waste your time thinking about the negatives."

      "body": "Learn to Appreciate:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a man who was very helpful, kindhearted, and generous. He was a man who will help someone without asking anything to pay him back. He will help someone because he wants to and he loves to. One day while walking into a dusty road, this man saw a purse, so he picked it up and noticed that the purse was empty. Suddenly a woman with a policeman shows up and gets him arrested.\n\nThe woman kept on asking where did he hide her money but the man replied, \"It was empty when I found it, Mam.\" The woman yelled at him, \"Please give it back, It's for my son's school fees.\" The man noticed that the woman really felt sad, so he handed all his money. He could say that the woman was a single mother. The man said, \"Take these, sorry for the inconvenience.\" The woman left and policeman held he man for further questioning.\n\nThe woman was very happy but when she counted her money later on, it was doubled, she was shocked. One day while woman was going to pay her son's school fees towards the school, she noticed that some skinny man was walking behind her. She thought that he may rob her, so she approached a policeman standing nearby. He was the same policeman, who she took along to inquire about her purse. The woman told him about the man following her, but suddenly they saw that man collapsing. They ran at him, and saw that he was the same man whom they arrested few days back for stealing a purse.\n\nHe looked very weak and woman was confused. The policeman said to the woman, \"He didn't return your money, he gave you his money that day. He wasn't the thief but hearing about you son's school fees, he felt sad and gave you his money.\" Later, they helped man stand up, and man told the woman, \"Please go ahead and pay your son's school fees, I saw you and followed you to be sure that no one steals your son's school fees.\" The woman was speechless.\n\nMoral: Life gives you strange experiences, sometime it shocks you and sometimes it may surprise you. We end up making wrong judgments or mistakes in our anger, desperation and frustration. However, when you get a second chance, correct your mistakes and return the favor. Be Kind and Generous. Learn to Appreciate what you are given."

And with their birthdayscoming in December, Mommy and Daddy also always made sure their birthdays werespecial even though Christmas was right around the corner. The party was so fun with aclown and cake and songs and wonderful presents from their friends and grandparentsand uncle and aunts. \n\nIt went by so fast but before they knew it, everyone had gone homeand it was time to clean up and get ready for bed.Evening family devotions were one of the most important parts of Lee and Larry’s day.Daddy read part of the story of Jesus coming at Christmas which is where he read everyyear during December so they would know the real reason for Christmas, to celebrate thebirth of Jesus. \n\nAt the end of it, Lee asked, “Daddy, did Jesus get a birthday party everyyear with presents and a clown too?”Everybody laughed trying to imagine what kind of birthday party Mary and Joseph gavefor Jesus when He was six. Larry wondered, “I bet he liked the same kind of toys welike.”“Well, what does God like?” Lee added. \n\n“I mean, we like cookies and cartoons andtoys, but what kind of things are fun for God?” It was a question that for a minuteMommy and Daddy had to think about.“I know!” Said Larry. “I bet he likes angels because he has them around all the time.Maybe he and the angels play family games like we do sometimes. Maybe they playMonopoly.” \n\nThis made Mommy laugh really hard.“Or maybe he likes bowling.” Lee continued. “I heard someone say that when you hearthunder, that means that God is bowling in heaven. I bet he is really good at it.”“I bet he is PERFECT at it!” Laughed Larry.“Well boys,” Mommy finally said after they had come up with lots of silly ideas of whatGod did for fun, “What God really likes is when people love each other and take care ofeach other like we do in our family.” \n\nThat made sense to Lee and Larry so Lee huggedMommy and Larry hugged daddy to just make God happy.“You know what Pastor Johansson told us on Sunday is that God really likes worship.”Daddy added.“You mean like when we sing praise songs in Church?” Larry asked and daddy nodded.“Well I can make up a worship song.” So Larry jumped to his feet and began to make upa song to a very bad tune. “Jesus is so cool. Its fun being with God. \n\nHe is the funnestGod anyone could have.” Larry sang very badly so Lee had put his hands over his ears.“Singing worship songs is good but that’s not the only way to worship.” Daddy said,maybe to make Larry stop singing. “There are lots of ways to worship.”‘LIKE WHAT DADDY, TELL US, TELL US.” Both boys jumped up and downwanting to know how to make God happy.“Well like Mommy said, when we love each other and love the world that Jesus died for,that’s a kind of worship.\n\n When we think about God and listen to the sermon or in SundaySchool, that’s a way of worshipping because we are learning how great God is and Helikes that. Or when we sit around and tell each other what the greatest things about Godare.\n\n You know how much you like hearing people say how smart or cute you boys are?Well God likes when we talk together about how great he is.” Daddy answered.“I know a game we can play that is like Daddy is talking about.” Mommy said makingboth boys want to know the game a lot. \n\n“It’s called ‘What is the best thing about God.And each of us has to come up with one really great thing we like about God. Who wantsto go first?” Lee and Larry jumped and shouted “ME ME!” waving their hands in the airlike they do at school. Finally, Mommy said, “Well Lee, since you are two minutes olderthan Larry, you can go first.”“Ok,” Lee said and then he stopped and thought. “The best thing about God is ………hmmmm……………..” He puzzled because he had so many things that were great aboutGod but he wanted to pick the best one so he would win the game. \n\n“That he knowseverything. That’s really cool. That means he can help me with my homework.” Larryconcluded with a proud expression on his face.“My turn, my turn.” Larry said eagerly wiggling to get a chance to talk. \n\n“I think the bestthing about God is that he can beat up the devil because the devil is scary and mean andugly and bad and God can beat him up so the devil can’t hurt us like he did those demonfilled people in Jesus day.”Mommy and Daddy hugged the twins because it was getting time to get to bed.“Mommy thinks the best thing about God is he gave me these two little rascals and theyare the best thing in Mommy’s world.” \n\nShe said cuddling and tickling both boys. Thatwas the kind of thing mommies always say. The giggled and hugged Mommy and werealmost ready to go to their bunk beds when Lee said.“Daddy you didn’t say what the best thing about God is. You have to play too.”“Well, I am surprised you all left the very extra best one for me.” Daddy said with ateasing smile. \n\n“It’s that he sent Jesus to die for us and give us life forever and ever andthat because of that we will be a family in heaven for millions of years. That’s prettygood isn’t it?”“Daddy wins!” The twins declared.“This is such a fun game and we had a perfect birthday Daddy.” Larry added. “Can weplay ‘What’s the best thing about God’ tomorrow too?” he begged his Mommy.“You can play it anytime you want.” Daddy answered. “Because talking about howgreat God is makes him happy and its worship. \n\nPlay it before you go to sleep tonight andwhen you wake up in the morning and God will be close to you all day long.“WE WILL.” They both shouted and they ran to the bedroom bickering about who getsto go first."

The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three months of training the master had taught him only one move. \"Sensei,\"(Teacher in Japanese) the boy finally said, \"Shouldn't I be learning more moves?\" \"This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,\" the sensei replied.\n\nNot quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training. Several months later, the sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match. Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.\n\nThis time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened. \"No,\" the sensei insisted, \"Let him continue.\" Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard. Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament.\n\nHe was the champion. On the way home, the boy and sensei reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind.\n\n\"Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?\"\n\n\"You won for two reasons,\" the sensei answered. \"First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo.

Oh, how they preened their feathers and tried on different flowersand new ways to waddle that they thought would give them the edge to win the contest.They quacked nonstop each evening before the competition about which one was theprettiest duckling of them all and often times they fought and got their feelings hurt andhad to go pout because each thought he was the prettiest and each one worried that he orshe wasn’t.\n\nIt seemed like every duck in the colony could only think of the pageant and getting ready.Every duck except for Chucky. Chucky didn’t care about being beautiful or beingadmired. His favorite thing to do was have friends over and getting to know them andsharing Jesus with them. The other ducks just didn’t understand Chucky at all. Heassociated with the most unacceptable types. Chucky enjoyed having the frogs, theturtles, even the field mice to his home. To the other dignified ducks, it was out of thequestion to associate with such unworthy beasts who were clearly not as advanced andsophisticated much less as pretty as the ducks.\n\n“Chucky, why don’t you pretty yourself up? I bet with some preening and some prettyflowers, you could be able to compete in the beauty pageant on Saturday.” His friendGracie Gander said to him.\n\n“That’s not important Gracie.” He answered her. But Friday night I am having a smalldinner party. Why don’t you come? Roger Rodent will be here with his family as wellas Terry Turtle and his girlfriend Teresa. We are going to play twister. It will be fun.”“Oh Chucky, there is no way I could socialize with THOSE species.” Gracie saidproudly and she strutted out of Chucky’s home proudly.\n\nThe day of the pageant was so exciting. Ducks scurried about in nervous excitementabout the chance to win the big prize, although there really was no prize. Finally the timecame. Chucky and his guests watched form a distant hill as they sipped their tea and atetheir cookies. The Ducks mixed and mingled in a group waiting for the pageant to start,sometimes pushing and biting each other in frustration and jealousy.\n\n“FLY!” came the sudden command. Suddenly, catastrophe struck. From the tall grass,the human hunters stood up and began to shoot their guns. The duck colony was caughttotally by surprise. An alert duckling spotted the hunters just before they struck andsounded the alarm. Instinct set in and the colony lifted into the air flying every directionso as not be good targets and flew in a panic away from the lake. The rifles rang theirshots out in a riot of explosions that sounded like the world was ending. But no duck waskilled. The hunters were mad and took their equipment and moved on to another site toshoot ducks.\n\nChucky excused himself from his guests who understood his concern. Quickly hewaddled to the standard retreat spot where his fellow ducks would gather after such anattack. He got there before most of the frightened colony but when he did, he foundsomething very upsetting. Gracie was hurt badly. Chucky went to her and comfortedher. “Why me Chucky?” She cried and he plucked his own feathers to pad the placeswhere she was hurt for warmth. Soon the whole colony arrived and they were all worriedand upset but they would not come near Gracie.\n\n“Come help me.” Chucky pleaded with them. “She is hurt. She needs all of our help.”“Oh no.” the other ducks said proudly. “We could never soil ourselves with her now.What if some of the dirt and blood got on our feathers? No, no, Chucky. Just leave her.We cannot afford to be soiled like that.” And slowly the colony slipped away. ButChucky didn’t care about being dirty or getting her blood on him. He just knew he had tosave his dear friend.\n\n“I have to get her to my house where I can help her heal.” She quacked to himself.\n\n“We will help.” Came the squeaky voice from the edge of the clearing. There stood hismany friends that the other ducks would not associate with. The frogs, the turtles, thefield mice, the rodents, the snakes all showed up. Chucky was always there for them,now they were here for him. They gathered around Gracie and helped transport her toChucky’s home where she began to heal.\n\n“Chucky, I feel so ashamed I was bad to your friends.” Gracie said a few days later asshe was getting better. “Why do you think they helped you save me?” She wondered.\n\n“Because that is what Jesus would do.” Chucky responded bringing her some more soup.“We are made in God’s image and God sent his son to save us and nothing would stophim from doing that. So the least we can do is reach out to friend to show her the samelove.” he said. Gracie was so grateful and wanted to learn more about Jesus andChucky’s good friends. Never again did she worry about being beautiful or proud as shewas before the pageant. Now she just wanted to be more like Jesus, just like you and Iwant to be."

      "body": "Mercury And The Woodcutter:\n\nOnce there was a woodcutter. He lived near a forest. He earned his living by cutting wood from the jungle and selling it in the market.\n\nOne day he was cutting down a tree on the bank of the river. While he was cutting it, his axe fell into the river and was lost.\n\nHe tried his best to search it but in vain. He was very poor and was not in a position to purchase another. So he began to weep and cry at the loss of it.\n\nMercury, the God of the river, heard his cry and appeared before him. He asked him why he was weeping. The woodcutter told him that he had only one axe with which he used to cut wood and earn his living. As the axe had fallen into the river, so was he weeping.\n\nThe god at once jumped into the water and came out with a golden axe. The woodcutter refused to take it.\n\nThen again he dived into the water. This time he brought out a silver axe. Again, the woodcutter said that it was not his. His axe was an ordinary one made of iron.\n\nMercury dived into the water the third time and appeared with an iron axe. \"That is my axe,\" shouted the woodcutter out of joy. The god was very pleased with him for his honesty and gave him all the three axes. The woodcutter was overjoyed and went home thanking the god.\n\nMoral:\nHonesty is the best policy."

      "body": "Is It Sin If You Didn’t Know?:\n\nThou Shalt not Steal\n\nSusan and Janie and Heather loved to go to the mall. If they had a little money to spend,that was extra fun but even if they didn’t they loved to just look at things and get treats atthe food court and meet friends from school and church and just be kids for a while.Susan’s mother felt sure the mall was safe because the girls were together and had goodcommon sense and several members of their church worked at the mall and the foodcourt so they kept an eye on the girls, even though the girls didn’t know that.\n\nThis Saturday was like all the others as Susan waited for Janie and Heather to get to herhouse for mom to drive them to the mall. She fussed with her make up and hair tryingdifferent styles and thinking of how the kids in school would react to a different color.Finally, they got here and everybody in the house scattered as the girls had their reunionin the front all with all the necessary giggling and gossiping and telling each other howcute they looked in their outfits.\n\n“Mom are you ready to go?” Susan called up the stairs. “Janie and Heather are here.”\n\n“Just a minute honey.” Susan’s mom yelled down and finally she came down all ready togo but she had Susan’s little brother Timmy tagging along with her. “Susan, be a dearand let Timmy tag along with you girls. Mrs. Henderson next door is sick so he can’t goover there.”\n\nAt first, Susan pouted and made a fuss because she was afraid Timmy would be a bother.\n\n“Susan let him come. We love Timmy. He is so funny and cute and we will help youwatch him so he doesn’t wander off.” Janie whispered to her friend.\n\n“Yes do Susan” Heather chimed in “You know all the kids love Timmy when he comesand sits in on Sunday School when your dad teaches.”\n\nSo Susan agreed and they all had a big time tickling Timmy in the car and getting him tolaugh and making him everybody’s cute little brother, not just Susan’s. At the mall, thefour had a wonderful time together. Instead of being a bother, Timmy learned how tomake his sister and her friends laugh with his silly faces or things he would say makingfun of the clothes or the people at the mall walking around. “He’s so funny Susan, wejust love him.” Heather said once laughing at his antics so hard that she almost felldown. The afternoon passed quickly and before they knew it, mom had picked them upand they were on the way home for a sleepover.\n\nThe girls got busy getting Susan’s room ready for a night of watching chick flicks anddoing all the fun things that a sleepover had to have. There was plenty of popcorn andice cream and make up to do each other over with and they were talking and trying todecide what movies to watch. Suddenly the air was filled with loud sobs.\n\n“Susan!” She heard her sweet little brother cry out from his room down the hall. Allthree girls ran in. There on his bed sat Timmy cross-legged. He had spread on hisblanket some of the toys he had bought at the mall but he was holding a big candy barand just sobbing. Susan loved Timmy tons and didn’t want him to cry so she sat on thebed and held him and Heather and Janie patted him and comforted him.\n\n“What is it Timmy, did someone hurt you?” Susan gently asked him as he calmed downenough to talk.\n\n“No, look!” and he opened his hand which was wrapped around a very large candy bar.\n\n“I don’t think I paid for this Susan. I know I had it in my hand at that candy booth in thefood court. But Heather called for me to come look at the movie posters and I just ran toher with it in my hand and put it in my bag without thinking. I stole it Susan.” Hesobbed. “God is going to hate me, won’t he? I did a terrible sin.”\n\n“Susan, remember Pastor Smith’s sermon last week on ‘Thou Shalt Not Steal?” Janieasked. “I know all of us including Timmy went to the alter and promised God we neverwould steal. What’s going to happen Susan? Will Timmy go to hell for stealing now?”Janie asked her friend and she was near tears at the idea of Timmy being in so muchtrouble with God.”\n\n“I don’t know” Susan exclaimed nearing tears herself holding Timmy tight.All of the children were about to break down in tears when Heather finally said, “Waitlet’s ask your mom.” She ran to the door, out into the hall and called down to Susan’smom. “Mrs. Morris, please come help!” Her voice was so full of panic that Susan’smom came rushing up the stairs expecting to find someone bleeding. She found the girlsand Timmy sobbing in Timmy’s room.\n\n“Timmy, Susan, what’s wrong? Are you sick?” Their mom said warmly but a littlescared touching each of their heads for a temperature like all moms do.\n\n“No its worse. I think Timmy is doomed.” Susan cried. “See when we went to themall…” and between all four of them Mrs. Morris figured out what the problem was.Suddenly just laughed out loud like she had heard the funniest joke ever.\n\n“Why are you laughing mom? I don’t want Timmy to go to hell.” Susan objected.\n\n“Kids listen to me. Timmy, did you intend to steal the candy?” She asked holdingTimmy’s hand. Heather and Janie sat cross-legged on the floor listening.\n\n“No Mommy, I didn’t even know I did it. Is that sin Mommy? Is it sin if you didn’tknow?” He asked desperate to know if he was in bad trouble with God.\n\n“Kids remember our Sunday School lesson about sin? Remember what sin is?” Sheasked.\n\n“I remember Mrs. Morris.” Said Janie. “Sin is anything that keeps us from loving God.”\n\n“That’s right Janie. Timmy, sin is something that comes out of your heart when it wantsto rebel against God. It is something you decide to do when you know you shouldn’t. Ifyou had found the candy in your bag and not cried and not told anyone and kept it or ateit knowing you had not paid for it, then you would have stolen it and you would be in sin.“Then I am not doomed, Mommy?” Timmy said trying to feel relieved.\n\n“You are sensitive to what God wants, Timmy. Girls you are too, that’s why you cried somuch. That’s good. It hurts your heart to think of someone you love going to hell.That’s how God feels and that is why Jesus came and died for our sins. Let’s pray thatGod take all of our sins out of our hearts.” And they all bowed their heads and prayedand when they looked up, instead of tears, there were pretty smiles on all their faces.\n\n“But what about the candy bar, Mom?” Susan wanted to know.\n\n“Tell you what, Timmy. Let’s let the girls get their sleepover going. You and I will runover to the mall, tell the man what happened and you can pay for the candy bar with yourallowance money and everything will be right again.”\n\n“Will it really Mommy?” Timmy said with excitement “Will it make it like I never didthe bad thing.”\n\n“It will be better than that because the man will know you are an honest boy and he willtrust you even more. Better than that, while we are there, let’s get candy bars for all of usand we can join the party, ok?”\n\nHOORAY! All the children leapt with glee and danced around hugging and kissing Mrs.Morris for being so wise."

She never talkedto me.” Janey said.\n\n“Well, you have to ask her the right questions.” Gary said smugly. “I just asked herwhat she wanted to be and she told me that she wanted to be…..”\n\n“President, that’s right.” Fluffy said walking slowly into the room. “No need to whisper,everybody knows I am going to be president. No, no, you had it all wrong Gary.” Thelittle yellow cat with long soft fur said beginning to purr. “I don’t think I am president,NOW. But I will be, its my destiny.” She said with a bit of an accent. A feline accent nodoubt.\n\n“But Fluffy,” Janey said having trouble believing she was conversing with the house cat.“Why do you think you should be president? You are just a cat?”\n\n“I know God made me for great things Janey.” Fluffy said licking her toes. “He madeyou for great things too, maybe not as great as me but great things.”\n\n“Fluffy?” Gary said puzzled. “Do the other animals want to be president also?” hewanted to know.\n\n“Well no,” Fluffy answered, “that would be just silly now wouldn’t it?\"\n\n“Not as silly as 12 pound cat who needs help getting down from trees wanting to bepresident.” Janey thought but she didn’t say it because she didn’t want to upset Fluffy.\n\n“No, it’s different for different ones.” Fluffy continued. “Ralphie the dog thinks he isAlexander the Great. But I think he might be mistaken because I think Alexander theGreat didn’t walk on all fours” Fluffy speculated.\n\n“The gerbil thinks he is Abraham Lincoln. I am working with him on that one. And thenthere’s your two gold fish, Frank and Ernest? Well they think they are world war twoflying aces. I wish you would talk to them about that Janey. They like you.” Shecontinued seeing the amazement on the faces of the humans. “The duckling we got forEaster thinks he is Albert Einstein and you know that big fat squirrel that keep seating allthe bird seed your parents put out?” Fluffy asked.\n\n“Yes, who does he think he is?” Gary wondered.\n\n“He thinks he is The Pope.” Fluffy informed Gary. “But he isn’t because I saw a pictureof the pope on TV yesterday and the pope is definitely not a squirrel.” She concluded.“Wow,” said Janey. “I had no idea animals thought so highly of themselves.” And shewhistled.\n\n“Well Janey,” Fluffy continued rolling on her back until she fell off the couch. “It’spossible some of us might be mistaken. But you know, you can feel inside that God hascreated you for something special can’t you?”\n\n“I know what you mean.” said Gary. “Pastor Mathers talked about knowing God’s willfor your life last Sunday and ever since then I have felt God has a calling for me but Idon’t know what it is.”\n\n“Me too Gary.” Janey said petting Fluffy which she liked a lot. “At the youth retreat, Ialmost felt like God was leading me to go on the missions trip but I don’t know for sure.”\n\n“Well, I am only a house cat.” Fluffy said realistically “but us animals know that God hasmade each of us for a special purpose. Janey and Gary, you keep praying and you willfind out what he has put you on earth to do. You know what Janey, when you pet me, Ireally get the sense you are going to do some big things for God.” Fluffy said and thatmade Janey smile.\n\n“What about me Fluffy?’ Gary said feeling slightly left out. “I think God might have bigthings for me too.”\n\n“I know he does Gary.” Fluffy said jumping down and turning her tail to walk out in ahuff as cats like to do. “But first maybe you should learn to clean up your room.”"

      "body": "The Broken Angel:\n\nValue: The Love of God\n\nMaggie liked watching big storms. So when the rain was really pouring down that night,she sat in the front room with the lights off and watched it safely in her house. Suddenlyshe saw a small figure walking into their cul-de-sac. It was a girl. She had no coat onand the rain was soaking her hair and dress completely. It was clear she was crying.\n\n“Mommy come quick.” Maggie cried out and when mommy saw the poor girl, sherushed out onto the porch. Maggie came out with her and as she looked more closely,she suddenly recognized the girl. “Oh Mommy, its Angie!” Angie was Maggie’s bestfriend ever and they had been like sisters since kindergarten.\n\n“Go get her Maggie.” Mommy said wisely knowing that if Angie was upset, seeing herdear friend first would be the best thing. She watched her daughter rush to the street andembrace her friend and then lead her back to the porch. As the girls approached, mommywent inside and got some blankets to dry Angie.\n\n“I ran away Maggie. I am so cold.” Angie said as Maggie brought her to the house.\n\n“Come in. You will get sick out here.” Maggie said in tears so afraid for her friend.Angie came in and quickly mommy and daddy were there drying her hair and warmingher. Mommy gave her some of Maggie’s warmest things to wear for a while and daddygot some of the hot soup they had enjoyed at dinner and the whole family sat with herand made her feel safe and loved as she recovered. Angie just looked at Maggie’s momand dad in amazement as she sipped her soup and finally the shivering stopped.\n\n“Why don’t you two girls go to Maggie’s room and play so you can settle down.”Mommy said noticing that Angie wasn’t talking much with the adults around.\n\n“Why did you run away?” Maggie asked right away when they were in her room.\n\n“I was so afraid. My mom has a very expensive display of glass angel statues. Wellwhile they were out today, I took one down the play with it and I broke its wing. I thinkit was her favorite and I knew she would be so mad so I ran away. I was so upset, Ididn’t know where else to go so I came to you.” Angie said crying again.\n\n“I am so glad you came here Angie.” Maggie said hugging her friend.\n\n“Your parents are so amazing. They didn’t act mad that I messed up their carpet oranything.\n\n“Angie, parents are like that. Your mom and dad are too. Sure, they correct us. We needthat. But your mom and dad love you no matter what.” Maggie explained.\n\n“Angie, your mom is on the phone.” Maggie’s mommy called. Right away Angie gotscared. Then Maggie’s mommy stepped into the room holding her hand over the speaker.“She is crying Angie. I told her you were safe but she wants to tell you how much sheloves you.”\n\nMaggie and her mom stepped out so she could take the call. Finally, she came outsniffling. She handed the phone to Maggie’s mom to talk to her parents and then turnedto Maggie. “She said nothing in the world was more important than me and she wantedme home in my own room where I can be safe and with her and daddy.” Angie saidlooking confused.\n\nWhen Maggie’s mom finished on the phone she sat down with the girls and helped Angiedry her tears. Maggie’s daddy came in and sat down too. “I don’t understand why mymommy isn’t really mad I broke her angel.” She told Maggie’s parents.\n\n“Angie, you have to understand something about parents.” Daddy said. “Your dad andmom love you no matter what. When they scold or try to teach you, that is part of lovebecause they just want you to grow up to be all that God made you to be. But their loveis unconditional. That means nothing you can do will make you deserve it and nothingbad you ever do will ever make them stop loving you.”\n\n“But I don’t understand how they can do that” Angie said looking to Maggie’s dad forhelp.\n\n“That’s easy Angie.” Mommy interrupted. “It’s because that is how God loves us andhow God loves you. God is your heavenly father and he made moms and dad just likehim. In fact, God loved you and me so much, he was willing to let Jesus die on the crossso we can always be in heaven with him. Your mom and dad would die rather than seeyou hurt sweetie. That is the nature of God in them.” She said holding Angie’s hand.\n\n“But I love them so much. I don’t want them to die or sick or get old or even be sad.”Angie said emotionally.\n\n“Then let’s get you home to them and when you get there, you hug them and tell themhow much you love them.” Daddy instructed her. “Then in the future if you dosomething wrong, you tell them right away and never ever run away again ok?”\n\n“I promise.” Angie said and then Maggie and her parents drove her home.\n\nAs she ran up to the door and hugged her mom and then her dad. Maggie said. “It’s toobad about the broken angel.”\n\nBut mommy just smiled and hugged Maggie as she watched. “It looks to me like the reallittle angel isn’t broken any more and will never get broken again.”"

      "body": "Stanley The Snowman:\n\nValue: The Story of Hanukah\n\nAman wrote a very fun little Christmas song called “Frosty the Snowman” and you allknow it pretty well. Why don’t you sing a little of it because I tell you the true story ofFrosty the Snowman?\n\nAll done? Good, well what you don’t know that most of the Christmas stories you knowabout, even the silly ones, started as a true story but the songwriters change them some sothey make good songs. Well that’s especially true with the story of Frosty. But his namewasn’t Frosty. It was Stanley. You have to admit “Stanley the snowman was a jollyhappy soul.” sounds pretty silly.\n\nStanley was built by Jack and Susan and their dad two days before Christmas. Jack wasin 4th grade and Susan was in 5th and they made sure Stanley had lots of good clothes towear and extra good things for his eyes, nose and mouth. See their daddy told them thatan ancient custom tells us that if you make a snowman realistic enough, he will come tolife. It’s not a bad theory. This Christmas, you and your family see if you make a supergood snowman and you might have an adventure like the one I am telling you about too.\n\nStanley did come to life that night. Dad waited up and watched him begin to step out onhis new snow legs and begin to explore the world. Your dad is aware of a lot of magic hehasn’t told you about yet so listen when he tells his stories. They are all true. Stanleydidn’t just dance around all night though. Before Jack and Susan met him Christmas eveday, he had build a very nice snowman home, a little house for his snow dog if jack andSusan were to make him one and a snow car although it didn’t actually drive.\n\nJack and Susan were pretty shy when they got up early that morning and saw Stanleyhappily making his house. Finally, Jack led Susan out to meet the magical snowman.“Hello?’ Jack said timidly.\n\n“Hello isn’t a question.” Stanley said and he put his big snow head back and laughed.“You are alive. Just like daddy said.” Susan said. “How can it be?” She gasped still alittle afraid.\n\n“Well Susan,” Stanley explained. “Every Christmas, there is so much magic and miraclepower in the air because of the coming of Christ, some of it leaks out onto silly snowmenlike me.” He bowed low bending at his snowman waist. “I am Stanley. I am here toplay with you.”\n\n“HOORAY!” the children yelled and they stopped being afraid and ran and played withStanley with all their might. Stanley was pretty good at finding games and they rode onhis shoulders as he went all over town, meeting their friends and teachers and the Minsterat their church too.\n\n“I have heard of the Christmas miracle.” Pastor Kelly said, “but you are a wholedifferent kind of miracle aren’t you Stanley?” He laughed.\n\nAs the sun went down, it was finally Christmas Eve. Jack and Susan sipped hot cocoamommy made inside of Stanley’s wonderful snowman house. “You are the bestChristmas present ever Stanley.” Susan said and she hugged his neck getting snow onher cheeks.\n\n“But there are so many wonderful presents to have Susan. What would be the bestpresent in the whole world?” Stanley asked.\n\n“I don’t know Stanley” Jack said feeling confused a little.\n\n“Well let’s go see.” The magical snowman said. Just like that, they were flying throughthe night sky just like Santa but holding onto Stanley snow hands for all they could.They stopped at a big palace of a mighty king. “These children have a castle and they areprinces and princesses. Maybe I should make you the kings kids for a Christmaspresent.” He said loudly so the guards nearby got nervous.\n\n“No, “Susan said shyly. I wouldn’t be able to run and play with everyone, just otherprincesses, I wouldn’t like that. Show us more.”\n\nAnd Stanley did. They flew like the wind passing birds and airplanes and knocking onthe windows to spell out Merry Christmas in the frost as they flew next to them goingwherever Stanley wanted to go. They saw children who go wonderful stables full ofhorses, others that got staring roles in the best movies just because their parents werepowerful and rich. They even met children who wished to become an eagle and fly highin the sky or any animal they wanted and the magic of Christmas made it all so. Stanleysaid because of the powerful magic of Christmas, all of these things could be theirs. Jackand Susan loved the wonderful travel and seeing so many amazing and exotic things butfinally Susan said. “Stanley can we go home?”\n\nBack at their back yard, Stanley served them cookies in his little home again. “But whydon’t you want the most expensive presents and ponies and all these things. After all,Christmas brings that kind of magic.” He asked.\n\n“Well,” Jack said. “The more we flew, the more I knew it wouldn’t be Christmas unlessit was with our mommy and our daddy in our little house with regular presents.Somehow, those presents don’t mean Christmas to me.\n\n“Me too, Stanley. Something was missing from all that and that thing, whatever it is,makes Christmas wonderful.”\n\n“Then I know the most special present of all that will make Christmas more special thanever before.” Stanley said with a big snowman smile and he clapped his hands. InstantlyJack and Susan were in a stable. They saw Mary and Joseph looking down. And thenJoseph signaled that it was their turn to look.\n\n“Jack,” Susan said gasping with awe and wonder at where they were. “It’s the babyJesus.” And they stepped up and looked down at his innocent eyes and his sweet smile.Jack even reached down and stroked his cheek. For his whole life, Jack never forgot howthe skin of the newborn savior felt. Outside of the stable, they ran to Stanley.\n\n“This is the present that is better than any we have seen tonight.” Jack said happily.\n\n“That’s because God gave this present to give us life that can never end.” Stanleyexplained. “Horses would go away, mansions would decay, toys would break or youwould grow out of all those things. But life eternal is something you will never stopusing.”\n\n“It feels like it really is Christmas now Stanley!” Susan said loudly and with that, theywere instantly on their porch.\n\n“You know it all along that nothing could compare with Jesus for the best Christmaspresent ever didn’t you?” Jack said to Stanley.\n\n“Yes Jack and I knew you knew it too. It was fun having an adventure but now its timeto worship the new born king.”\n\n“But we don’t want you to go Stanley.” Susan said with a small sob.\n\n“I won’t be far away. Next Christmas build a snowman twice as good and we will haveadventures a hundred times better than these. But just like this Christmas Eve, we willend each night worshiping Jesus for saving all people from their sins.”\n\n“HOORAY!” the kids shouted and they gave final snowy kisses and hugs to theirwonderful friend and ran inside to get on their best Christmas outfit’s to go to church andtruly praise Jesus for coming to fill their lives with love and the joy of Christmas everyyear."

      "body": "A Trip On A Comet:\n\nThe Sabbath Day\n\n“God is going to hear you talking about that Tommy and he won’t like it.” Steve told hisbest friend as they were going to school Monday morning.\n\n“Well I don’t get it. What is Sunday even good for anyway? I don’t get it. We go tochurch every Sunday but nobody knows why. Maybe it’s just a bunch of goofy rules thechurch made up so why should we do it anyway?” Tommy said in a snotty way. Tommyreally was a good boy. He loved God and his family and all those things but sometimeshe just had questions and he wanted someone to tell him the truth. Lots of us are likethat.\n\n“Tommy, be careful. If you keep asking those kinds of questions, well God can hearyou.” Steve said but Tommy said “fine” and he meant it. He didn’t care if God did hearhim. If God wanted to show him why Sunday was important, that would suit Tommy justfine. Tommy thought about it all day at school. As he walked out onto the playgroundafter school, he noticed that all of a sudden, there were not any other kids around.\n\nAs he came around the corner to the bicycles racks, he stopped short. He faced thebiggest pair of feet he ever saw. They had sandals and they together were so wide, hehad to turn his head to see from one toe to the other. Slowly Tommy’s eyes followed upthe massive legs to the edge of a huge white robe, on up the big body to a huge beamingface that was all white with a glow like it has a light bulb inside of it. Behind eachshoulder, he saw the edges of a huge angel’s wing.\n\n“Hello Tommy, you ready to go?” The angel said with a deep voice that seemed to fillevery inch of the air for miles around.\n\n“Who are you?” Tommy asked feeling it was a pretty good question.\n\n“I am Gabriel. I am the chief Angel of God. Are you ready to go find out why there is aSunday?” Gabriel answered in a kind but firm voice.\n\n“Where are we going?” Tommy wanted to know.\n\n“You will see when we get there.” The angel answered.\n\n“How will we get there?” Tommy continued.\n\n“Well by comet of course. See?” And Gabriel gestured over to the swing sets where hehad tied up to the jungle gym a steaming, flaming, very angry comet that didn’t like beingtied up and it wanted to go right now.\n\n“Well I……….” Tommy hesitated but he didn’t have time to finish deciding because ina flash he was holding on for dear life. The comet wasn’t tied to the jungle gym anymore, it was streaking through space faster than ten rockets with fire and smokestreaming past as Tommy held on to part of the comet and Gabriel’s toe. He suddenlyheard himself going “wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” but then he suddenly heard Gabriel going“wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee” too. Who knew angels go “wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee”?Suddenly it seemed like the comet wasn’t moving. Tommy couldn’t see anything butcould hear a sound like something out of control below. “Where is everything Gabriel?”Tommy asked.\n\n“Everything hasn’t been created yet.” He said, “Listen” and as Tommy listened, adifferent voice, a booming and yet endlessly loving voice spoke with more authority thanhis dad and the principle combined when it said…\n\n“LET THERE BE LIGHT!”.\n\nAnd so much light exploded, it was like a billion light bulbs. Suddenly things werehappening everywhere. He kept hearing that loving voice saying “LET THERE BE…”and more and more stuff happened. Below he saw a huge round thing form when herealized it was a planet and that it was his home, the earth. The sky formed up, really,really fast when that voice told it to and then the stars and the sun and then oceans andplants and plants and animals and then……… and then………\n\nThen Tommy saw a little space of dust. And that voice said “LET US MAKE MAN INOUR IMAGE…” and like some invisible hands were making a model, a shape of aperson formed in the dirt and then it was like a complete person with a face and fingersand everything but made all of dirt. Then a breeze came to it but not a regular breeze, itcame from that voice and when that breeze hit the dirt guy, he sat up and he was a person.\n\nSuddenly Tommy understood and he turned to Gabriel’s toe and then looked up and hesaid, “Gabriel is this why we have Sunday? To remember when God created the world?”“This is why we have the Sabbath, Tommy.” Gabriel said, “Let me show you why wehave a Sunday.” And the comet took off but moved like a super fast elevator andsuddenly Tommy was standing on a hill. He held on to Gabriel’s toe still but he wasn’thome or on the comet. He looked up at a huge signpost in the ground. But it wasn’t asignpost. It was a beam of wood and as he followed it up into the air, he saw a man, upon that wood, his arms out and he was stretched on a beam across. A beam that was like,well, like,….\n\n“It’s the cross!” Tommy said gasping at what he was seeing. He turned to Gabriel to tryto understand what he was seeing but when he did, Gabriel was gone. He turned backand the cross was gone but he saw the jungle gym and the swings and his bike in the bikerack and there stood Steve looking at him funny.\n\n“Tommy, where have you been? You look terrible.” Steve said helping Tommy get hisclothes back on right.\n\n“Never mind that. I know why we have a Sunday now Steve.”\n\n“You do? Why?”\n\n“Because of the Cross. Because Jesus died for us on that day and every Sunday weworship him for it and it is a holy day this week and every week for ever and ever andever.” Tommy said reverently.\n\n“Wow, that must have been some trip. Where did you go?”\n\n“I can’t explain it now Steve.” Tommy said. “But here is a souvenir and I will tell youlater” he said handing Steve something and walking to his bike. Steve looked down andopened his hand puzzled and wondered even more as he picked up the tiny piece ofcomet chip and put it in his pocket for later."

      "body": "Act Of Kindness And Goodwill:\n\nMr. Phillips was just getting ready to leave his office and he remembered that his wife had asked him to bring 1KG of Bananas. When He stepped out, he saw an ill-looking old lady across the road. She was selling fresh bananas on the street. Mr. Phillips usually buys bananas from a grocery shop few blocks away from his office but since he was in hurry to reach home today, he thought about buying them from across the road only.\n\nHe went to the old lady and asked her the price. She quoted $7 per 1KG. He told, “But the store where I usually buy from gives them for $5 per 1KG, can you not give me for the same price?” The Old Lady told, “No Sir, I can not afford to match that price. I can sell them to you at $6 per 1KG. That’s best I can afford to give you for.” Mr. Phillips told her, “nevermind”. He left in his car towards the usual grocery shop.\n\nHe went inside and picked up a good bunch of bananas. He went to the cashier to pay for them but he was surprised when the cashier told him that price per 1KG is $10. He told the cashier, “I have been buying bananas from here only for some years and this is a steep price increase, can’t you offer me a better deal for being a loyal customer?” The Manager overheard him and came there. He told Mr. Phillips, “Sorry Sir but our prices are fixed, we do not bargain.” Mr. Phillips felt little bad with that flat attitude. He thought for a second and put those bananas back. He went back to the old lady. She recognized him instantly and told him, “Sir, I can’t match that price, I won’t be able to earn any profit.”\n\nMr. Phillips told her, “Don’t worry about the price, I will pay you $10 Per KG! Now, give me 2KG.” The Old Lady got very happy, she packed 2KGs of Bananas and said, “I can’t take $10 but I will take $7 per KG. I appreciate your kindness.” She also told him, “My Husband used to own a small fruit shop but he got very sick. We have no child or any relatives who could support us. We had to sell his shop to cover his medical bills but he could not survive.” Tears were flowing from her eyes. She said, “But now to support myself I am trying to sell what I can afford to buy and sell, so I can survive for what’s left of my life.”\n\nMr. Phillips told her, “Do not worry, You are doing good and from tomorrow on, I will only buy bananas from you.”  He pulled out his wallet and gave her $100 extra and said, “Take this, Bring more different fruits to sell tomorrow, consider this an advance payment for fruits I will be buying from you. You can earn more if you have more choices of fruits to sell.” The Old Lady thanked him.\n\nLater, He recommended many of his colleagues to buy fruits from the lady which they did. And with the support from Mr. Phillips and many other buyers, she made a better living.\n\nMoral: Often we choose to go in big malls or big grocery shops for a shopping. We always pay the fixed price without bargaining. That is fine as we all have choices and people who run their business have their liabilities too.\n\n However, we need to spare a moment and think that why we have no courage or reason to bargain while shopping at big shops and why we try to bargain heavily with small street vendors? Think wisely. Always be helpful and supportive to someone who works hard to earn and has a need for it. Think, what Mr. Phillips had thought for a second and why he decided to buy from the old lady.."

      "body": "Merlin’s Magic Words:\n\nThe Name of Jesus\n\nJonathan and Gwen were the best of friends. They grew up next door neighbors and fromthe moment they could listen, they heard stories of the great King Arthur, his valiantknights of the round table, the beautiful princesses and the terrifying dragons and ofcourse the amazing and mysterious Merlin. How often they whispered to each other thatthey wished just one of these mythical people who were the rulers of their kingdomwould happen by to see them in their tiny village.\n\n“Do you think there are dragons in our forests or caves?” Gwen asked her friendcuriously.\n\n“Oh yes, there must be and when we are grown, I will fight them and King Arthur willmake me a knight of the round table.” Jonathan bragged beating on his chest until he hadto stop because it made him cough. The two walked along the path that lead to churchtalking about all these wonderful heroes and adventures that they wished they could bepart of. Up ahead they saw the tiny hut which was the church for their village and theycouldn’t help but look to the sky at the tall cross Jonathan’s daddy had carved and putthere to honor Jesus.\n\n“I wish I could see Merlin do his magic.” Jonathan continued.\n\n“Oh me too Jonathan” Gwen said with a sigh. It was not a sigh of unhappiness becauseshe was so content in her little village. She loved her parents and had wonderful friendslike Jonathan and they felt safe far from the wars that the king and his knights conductedto protect their homeland. But still, children long for adventure, even if they are afraidsometimes.\n\n“I wish I could clap my hands like this…” and he clapped loudly CLAP CLAP, “andMerlin would come and teach us his magic.”\n\n“Hee hee hee,” Gwen giggled, “Yes we could both clap...” and she mimicked her friendwith her more dainty claps CLAP CLAP “and he would come make us wizards too.\n\n“You are very good at clapping Sir Knight and Princess Gwen” the deep rumbling voicecame from just off the path. Gwen and Jonathan almost jumped out of their hair at thevoice. They landed on the other side of the path looking for the voice. There sitting on astump next to the church was what could only be a wizard. His long robe reached hissandaled feet. His white hair was long as was his pointed beard and his staff was tall andcrocked at the end and singed at the tip as though much fire had come from it. And hisrobe was covered with mythical and colorful symbols like stars and moons andmysterious runes that the children could not know.\n\n“Why did you call me Sir Knight?” Jonathan asked shyly. “I am just a little boy.”\n\n“Yes good Jonathan.” The kindly grandfatherly figure said with a smile. “Come closechildren, I am Merlin, you called for me. I come to give you the most powerful word inthe universe.” Gwen and Jonathan were drawn to the feet of the wizard. “You seeyourself as a child Jonathan. But Merlin can see beyond today to a world only a fewyears away. I can see for who you will become. For buried inside of you is the greatnessyou will grow in to. And inside this little boy Jonathan is a wonderful Knight who willserve his king and his Lord Jesus mightily not so many years from now.”\n\n“But how can you see us as we will be?” Gwen asked gazing wide eyed as the magicalman.\n\n“Because I see you as God sees you, Princess Gwen.” Merlin explained. “I see you forwhat God created you to be and a princess and a mighty knight you will be, if you serveJesus every day as you grow up.” The children smiled and blushed getting goose bumpsthinking of themselves as God sees them.\n\n“But did you say you were going to give us the most powerful magic ever?” Jonathansaid with a voice full of wonder and excitement.\n\n“Yes but first some lesser magic.” The wizard said with a wry grin. At that, he lifted hisstaff to the sky, exclaimed words the children could not understand and his clenched fistsprang open and sparks and tiny fires burst on the stones of the path in front of thechildren. Jonathan laughed and clapped and the sage wizard smiled with pleasure at theirgiggles.\n\n“DO MORE, DO MORE!” The children pleaded.\n\n“I will gladly,” Merlin said clearly having as much fun as the children. “Observe thatdog, you know him, all the villagers know him. His name is Buster” Merlin saidgesturing to the fluffy dog that was prancing down the path toward the church where heoften got fed by the priests. “Watch him walk like a human.” Merlin said in a powerfulmagician voice. He clapped again and just as though a spell changed Buster into aperson, the dog rose up on his hind legs and walked several steps. Merlin clapped againand Buster ran behind him.\n\nThe children clapped and giggled seeing the magical Merlin for real doing real magic forthem. “Please teach us to be wizards. Teach us the deepest secrets.” The said withhappy nagging in their voices.\n\n“All right but you must promise when I teach you the most powerful word in theuniverse, you will hold it dear in your heart.” The wizard warned them and they jumpedand leapt about like silly children, which they were, and promised and promised andpromised. Then Merlin made them sit at his feet and whispered to them.\n\n“The deep dark secret is this children…” he said gazing into their trusting eyes. “Thetricks you saw are not magic at all. Anyone can do them.” And at that, he opened hishand to show them some tiny white crystals. “These are sulfur crystals. They easilyburst into flames and they are how I made the ‘magic’ flames appear.”\n\n“But what about Buster?” Gwen objected. “You made him walk.”\n\n“Princess Gwen, the secret of magic is there is no source of power in the universe exceptthat which comes from God. You will be powerful in your knowledge of spiritual powerwhen you learn the word at which every knee shall bow and every spiritual being, demonand angel kneel and worship. Now watch.” And he whistled and buster came to him.He held his hand above the happy dog and opened it showing he had a treat which busterwas begging for. Merlin dropped the treat in his mouth after Buster danced on his toesgiving a show that made the children laugh and clap all over again. “When Buster walkedfor us earlier, he ran behind me to get his treat.” Merlin explained.\n\n“See children, these are harmless tricks but there is no spiritual power that can do mightyworks except those which God can do. And that is the powerful word you will nowknow. This word gives God’s children the power to do powerful things in His name.Just listen to the holy words about this amazing word.” And Merlin produced a big blackbook from his satchel.\n\n“I wonder if that is the book of spells.” Jonathan whispered but then Merlin read.“They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.” He read and the children justgasp with awe at the power of the word.\n\n“Tell us the word, Merlin. Please, please, please, please., please.” The children beggedand then he turned the pages of the book. As he lifted the book to read it, Gwen made outthe title. It was “The Holy Bible” and then Merlin read.\n\n“That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things inearth, and things under the earth;” and then he closed the book. “The name of Jesus is themost powerful word in the universe Children. With it we can heal the sick, cast out eviland become friends with God. And being a friend with God is even better than meetingKing Arthur, isn’t it children.\n\n“Yes Merlin” the children answered in awe.\n\n“But what can we do, Merlin?” Jonathan said confused. “We are just children.”\n\n“Obey Jesus, Children.” Merlin instructed. “Go to church and Sunday School everyweek. That is where you will learn how to use the name of Jesus. Pray and ask yourparents and teachers and pastor to teach you everything about God and Jesus and theBible and you will become powerful servants able to do mighty works, in the name ofchildren. And it can all start today, just inside this tiny church. That is where the poweris Sir Knight and Princess Gwen. Do you want it?”\n\n“YES’ and they ran to the church door and pulled it open. Just before they went in Gwenstopped.\n\n“Wait we forgot to thank him.” And they both looked back. But the powerful wizardwas not gone. All that remained was the a whirling smoke that curled around the stumpwhere he sat and Buster was dancing and barking happily on his hind legs like a human."

      "body": "Rubik’s Cube:\n\nValue: Missions\n\nPaul did not want to go on the mission trip to Ghana. He was absolutely terrified ofgoing. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Olson had gone on many such trips and knew the joysthat came from the hardships and especially the joys of sharing Jesus with people whowanted to know him so very much. So they made him go even though he pouted andlooked very afraid all the way over on the plane no matter what mommy and daddy saidto comfort him.\n\nWhen they arrived and got settled, everything Paul was afraid of turned out to be true.He hated it all. They didn’t have a nice hotel room to stay in. They had a hut. The foodwas weird and hard to eat and made of things American kids don’t eat. The peoplelooked funny, didn’t speak English and they even smelled strange to Paul. None of theevents or work assignments they got were fun to Paul and he felt sick a lot because hedidn’t like the food and didn’t sleep well. Noises in the night there were so differentfrom home.\n\nSo Paul just stayed in his hut every day as his parents went out and ministered to thepeople of the village. No matter how many wonderful stories he heard of God’s miraclesand the fun they were having getting to know the people, Paul was stubborn and hewould not leave his hut. He just sat there day in and day out and played with his Rubik’scube. He loved that toy. It was very good for keeping his mind off of his surroundingsand trying to solve it which he never did.\n\nOne Thursday morning, Paul got up and ate with his parents. He noticed that either theywere starting to serve American food or he was getting used to the stuff they cooked herebecause he kind of liked it and ate lots more than usual. Right on schedule then, Paul’sparents left to start the day’s work of building homes and buildings for the new church,teaching the people and working on Bible translations. Paul went to his bed and lookedfor his Rubik’s cube to start his day too.\n\nBut he could not find it. Where could it be? It was his best friend in this lonely place.He looked under his bedding, in his suitcase, everywhere. He was just frantic. He startedlooking all around the hut, even outside the windows on the off chance it got thrown outthere. Then he remembered. The night before his mom asked him to leave for a while soshe could clean up so he went out and found a tree stump down the hill from the hut areaand he had it with him. But it was too dark to play with it so he laid it on the stump. Thesounds of monkeys and animals in the trees started to make him afraid so he suddenlybolted back to the hut. He must have left it there.\n\nHe was going to have to go find it. Paul peeked out the door and the village area seemedquiet. So cautiously, he left the hut and walked down the hill toward the log. But hestopped when he got close. There was a small boy, about his size and age, sitting on thelog looking at something. As Paul approached carefully, the boy looked up. In his handswas the Rubik’s cube. The Ghana youth looked at it in his hands where he was playingwith it and then at Paul. Then the biggest smile you ever saw came over his face and heheld it out to Paul to return it to him. That smile was so warm, so happy and fun loving,it seemed to almost say to Paul, “come play with me”.\n\nPaul walked up slowly gazing at that friendly smile. The boy lifted the other hand andbegan to twist the Rubik’s cube skillfully but looking at Paul for approval. Paul watchedthe patterns the boy was making. “No not that way, this way” he felt himself saying inhis mind and before he knew it, he had sat down. Before long, the two boys wereengrossed in the toy. Paul could not resist helping the boy because it was clear thisstrange colored, funny smelling boy loved the Rubik’s cube just as much as Paul did andthat made him just like Paul, not a foreign person at all.\n\nThe boys played for hours and what Paul thought was a time for him to teach this simplevillager the hard logic of the Rubik’s cube suddenly changed when boy suddenly laughedwith joy and solved it. He chattered excited phrases to Paul in his own language and Paultook it from him and held it up and then burst into happy laughter. “YOU SOLVED IT!”he shouted with amazement and a thrilled joy. “I never saw anyone solve it! That’samazing!” Paul said with excitement. He patted the boy on the back showing his sincererespect for what he had done. “Hey let’s see if you can do it again.” Paul sand the thenhe mixed it all up again.\n\nRight away, the boy set to work, his tongue sticking out from his teeth just like Paul’s didwhen he was close to solving it. Paul watched tense as an athlete cheering in his heart forhis new friend to finish the puzzle. He didn’t see the lead missionary come up.\n\n“You boy’s having fun?” He said in his always friendly voice.\n\n“Yes. Reverend Keith. It’s amazing. He solved it! He solved the Rubik’s cube. This isso cool. I never had a friend who could…” Paul’s excited bragging was broken but ashriek of laughter form this Ghanan friend. ‘HE SOLVED IT AGAIN!” Paul declaredwith excitement and he literally jumped up and started patting the boy and telling himhow amazing he was. Reverend Keith was deeply pleased to see the boys from two verydifferent cultures find fun together. He talked to the boy whose name was Ramda andtold Paul his name and helped the boys talk to each other for about an hour before he hadto get back to work.\n\nRamda explained that he too had to go help his dad work on their hut but both boyspromised to meet tomorrow and play some more. As Paul and Reverend Keith walkedback to the missionary huts, Paul asked. “What did Ramda say to you as he wasleaving?”\n\n“Well Paul.” The missionary said. “He told me to thank you for playing with him and hemade an observation about the Rubik’s cube.”\n\n“Oh what did he say?” Paul asked with excitement. “He is so good at it. I want to knowhis secrets.”\n\n“He said it isn’t as hard as it looks.” Reverend Keith responded. “And you know Paul,the same is true of sharing your faith. By just being a friend, as you are being withRamda, even if you are enjoying it and it seems natural, you are sharing your faith. Allyou have to do is not hide what you know about Jesus and let God guide you in acts ofkindness, compassion and your natural desire to see Ramda be in heaven like you will.”\n\n“Well I want that for sure. Thanks Reverend. I will let God show me how to share Jesuswith Ramda. I want him in heaven partly because I want him to be happy and not go to,well, the bad place.” Paul answered.\n\n“What is the other part?” The missionary asked.\n\n“Well, so I will have him there to play with me.” Paul laughed."

      "body": "Beauty and the Beast:\n\nONCE upon a time there was a rich merchant, who had three daughters. They lived in a very fine house in a beautiful city, and had many servants in grand liveries to wait upon them. All their food was served on gold and silver dishes, and their gowns were made of the richest stuff sewn with jewels.\n\nThe two eldest were called Marigold and Dressalinda. Never a day passed but these two went out to some feast or junketing; but Beauty, the youngest, loved to stay at home and keep her old father company.\n\nNow, it happened that misfortune came upon the merchant. Ships of his which were sailing the high seas loaded with valuable goods, were wrecked, and in one day he found that he was no longer the richest merchant in the city, but a very poor man.\n\nThere was still left to him a little house in the country, and to this, when everything else had been sold, he retired. His three daughters, of course, went with him.\n\nMarigold and Dressalinda were very cross to think that they had lost all their money, and after being so rich and sought after, they must now live in a miserable cottage.\n\nBut Beauty’s only thought was to cheer her old father, and while her two sisters sat on wooden chairs and cried and bewailed themselves, Beauty lighted the fire and got the supper ready, for the merchant was now so poor that he could not even keep a servant.\n\nAnd so it went on. The two eldest sisters would do nothing but sulk in corners, while Beauty swept the floors and washed the dishes, and did her best to make the poor cottage pleasant. They led their sister a dreadful life too, with their complaints, for not only did they refuse to do anything themselves, but they said that everything she did was done wrong. But Beauty bore all their unkindness patiently, for her father’s sake.\n\nIn this way a whole year went by, and then one day a letter came for the merchant.\n\nHe hastened to find his daughters, for he was anxious to tell them the good news contained in the letter.\n\n“My dear children,” he said, “at last our luck has turned. This letter says that one of the ships supposed to have been lost has come safely home to port, and if that be so, we need no longer live in poverty. We shall not be so rich as before, but we shall have enough to keep us in comfort. Get me my traveling-cloak, Beauty. I will set out at once to claim my ship. And now tell me, girls, what shall I bring you when I come back?”\n\n“A hundred pounds,” said Marigold, without hesitating an instant.\n\n“I want a new silk dress,” said Dressalinda, “an apple-green one, sewn with seed-pearls, and green shoes with red heels, and a necklace of emeralds, and a box of gloves.”\n\n“And what shall I bring for you, my Beauty?” asked the father, as his little daughter helped him to put on his traveling-cloak.\n\n“Oh, bring me a rose,” said Beauty hastily.\n\nHer father kissed her fondly, and set out.\n\n“You silly girl,” said Marigold, “you just want our father to think you are more unselfish than we are—that’s what you want! A rose, indeed!”\n\n“Indeed, sister,” said Beauty, “that was not the reason. I thought our father would have enough to do in seeing to the safety of his ship, without being troubled to do shopping for me.”\n\nBut the sisters were very much offended, and went off to sit in their own room to talk of the fine things they would have when their father came back.\n\nIn the meantime the merchant went his way to the city, full of hope and great plans as to what he would do with his money.\n\nBut when he got there, he found that some one had played a trick on him, and no ship of his had come into harbor, so he was just as badly off as before.\n\nHe spent the whole day looking about to make sure there was no truth in the letter he had received, and it was beginning to get dusk when he started out, with a sad heart, to make the journey home again. He was tired and miserable, and he had tasted no food since he left home in the morning.\n\nIt was quite dark by the time he came to the great wood through which he had to pass to get to his cottage, and when he saw a light shining through the trees, he decided not to go to his home that night, but to make his way towards the light in the wood and ask for food and shelter.\n\nHe expected to find a woodcutter’s cottage, but what was his surprise, as he drew near to the light, to find that it came from the windows of a large and beautiful palace!\n\nHe knocked at the gates, but no one answered, and presently, driven by hunger and cold, he made bold to enter, and mounted the marble steps into the great hall.\n\nAll the way he never saw a soul. There was a big fire in the hall, and when he had warmed himself, he set out to look for the master of the house. But he did not look far, for behind the first door he opened was a cosy little room with supper set for one, a supper the mere look of which made you hungry.\n\nSo the merchant sat down as bold as you please, and made a very hearty supper, after which he again thought he would look for the master of the house.\n\nHe started off and opened another door, but there he saw a bed, merely to look at which made you sleepy, so he said to himself:\n\n“This is some fairies’ work. I had better not look any farther for the master of the house.”\n\nAnd with that he tumbled into bed, and, being very tired, he went to sleep at once, and slept like a top till it was time to get up in the morning.\n\nWhen he awoke he was quite surprised to find himself in such a soft and comfortable bed, but soon he remembered all that had happened to him.\n\n“I must be going,” he said to himself, “but I wish I could thank my host for my good rest and my good supper.”\n\nWhen he got out of bed he found he had something else to be grateful for, for on the chair by the bedside lay a fine suit of new clothes, marked with his name, and with ten gold pieces in every pocket. He felt quite a different man when he had put on the suit of blue and silver, and jingled the gold pieces of money in his pockets.\n\nWhen he went downstairs, he found a good breakfast waiting for him in the little room where he had supped the night before, and when he had made a good meal, he thought he would go for a stroll in the garden.\n\nDown the marble steps he went, and when he came to the garden, he saw that it was full of roses, red and white and pink and yellow, and the merchant looked at them, and remembered Beauty’s wish.\n\n“Oh, my poor daughters,” he said, “what a disappointment it will be to them to know that my ship has not come home after all, but Beauty at any rate can have what she wanted.”\n\nSo he stretched out his hand and plucked the biggest red rose within his reach.\n\nAs the stalk snapped in his fingers, he started back in terror, for he heard an angry roar, and the next minute a dreadful Beast sprang upon him. It was taller than any man, and uglier than any animal, but, what seemed most dreadful of all to the merchant, it spoke to him with a man’s voice, after it had roared at him with the Beast’s.\n\n“Ungrateful wretch!” said the Beast. “Have I not fed you, lodged you, and clothed you, and now you must repay my hospitality by stealing the only thing I care for, my roses?”\n\n“Mercy! mercy!” cried the merchant.\n\n“No,” said the Beast, “you must die!” The poor merchant fell upon his knees and tried to think of something to say to soften the heart of the cruel Beast; and at last he said, “Sir, I only stole this rose because my youngest daughter asked me to bring her one. I did not think, after all you have given me, that you would grudge me a flower.”\n\n“Tell me about this daughter of yours,” said the Beast suddenly. “Is she a good girl?”\n\n“The best and dearest in the world,” said the old merchant. And then he began to weep, to think that he must die and leave his Beauty alone in the world, with no one to be kind to her.\n\n“Oh!” he cried, “what will my poor children do without me?”\n\n“You should have thought of that before you stole the rose,” said the Beast. “However, if one of your daughters loves you well enough to suffer instead of you, she may. Go back and tell them what has happened to you, but you must give me your promise that either you, or one of your daughters, shall be at my palace door in three months’ time from to-day.”\n\nThe wretched man promised.\n\n“At any rate,” he thought, “I shall have three months more of life.”\n\nThen the Beast said, “I will not let you go empty-handed.”\n\nSo the merchant followed him back into the palace. There, on the floor of the hall, lay a great and beautiful chest of wrought silver.\n\n“Fill this with any treasures that take your fancy,” said the Beast.\n\nAnd the merchant filled it up with precious things from the Beast’s treasure-house.\n\n“I will send it home for you,” said the Beast, shutting down the lid.\n\nAnd so, with a heavy heart, the merchant went away; but as he went through the palace gate, the Beast called to him that he had forgotten Beauty’s rose, and at the same time held out to him a large bunch of the very best.\n\nThe merchant put these into Beauty’s hand when she ran to meet him at the door of their cottage.\n\n“Take them, my child,” he said, “and cherish them, for they have cost your poor father his life.”\n\nAnd with that he sat down and told them the whole story. The two elder sisters wept and wailed, and of course blamed Beauty for all that had happened.\n\n“If it had not been for your wanting a rose, our father would have left the palace in safety, with his new suit and his gold pieces; but your foolishness has cost him his life.”\n\n“No,” said Beauty, “it is my life that shall be sacrificed, for when the three months are over, I shall go to the Beast, and he may kill me if he will, but he shall never hurt my dear father.”\n\nThe father tried hard to persuade her not to go, but she had made up her mind, and at the end of the three months she set out for the Beast’s palace.\n\nHer father went with her, to show her the way. As before, he saw the lights shining through the wood, knocked and rang in vain at the great gate, warmed himself at the fire in the big hall, and then found the little room with the supper on the table that made you hungry to look at. Only this time the table was laid for two.\n\n“Come, father dear,” said Beauty, “take comfort. I do not think the Beast means to kill me, or surely he would not have given me such a good supper.”\n\nBut the next moment the Beast came into the room. Beauty screamed and clung to her father.\n\n“Don’t be frightened,” said the Beast gently, “but tell me, do you come here of your own free will?”\n\n“Yes,” said Beauty, trembling.\n\n“You are a good girl,” said the Beast, and then, turning to the old man, he told him that he might sleep there for that night, but in the morning he must go and leave his daughter behind him.\n\nThey went to bed and slept soundly, and the next morning the father departed, weeping bitterly.\n\nBeauty, left alone, tried not to feel frightened. She ran here and there through the palace, and found it more beautiful than anything she had ever imagined.\n\nThe most beautiful set of rooms in the palace had written over the doors, “Beauty’s Rooms,” and in them she found books and music, canary-birds and Persian cats, and everything that could be thought of to make the time pass pleasantly.\n\n“Oh, dear!” she said; “if only I could see my poor father I should be almost happy.”\n\nAs she spoke, she happened to look at a big mirror, and in it she saw the form of her father reflected, just riding up to the door of his cottage.\n\nThat night, when Beauty sat down to supper, the Beast came in.\n\n“May I have supper with you?” said he.\n\n“That must be as you please,” said Beauty.\n\nSo the Beast sat down to supper with her, and when it was finished, he said:\n\n“I am very ugly, Beauty, and I am very stupid, but I love you; will you marry me?”\n\n“No, Beast,” said Beauty gently.\n\nThe poor Beast sighed and went away.\n\nAnd every night the same thing happened. He ate his supper with her, and then asked her if she would marry him. And she always said, “No, Beast.”\n\nAll this time she was waited on by invisible hands, as though she had been a queen. Beautiful music came to her ears without her being able to see the musicians, but the magic looking-glass was best of all, for in it she could see whatever she wished. As the days went by, and her slightest wish was granted, almost before she knew what she wanted, she began to feel that the Beast must love her very dearly, and she was very sorry to see how sad he looked every night when she said “No” to his offer of marriage.\n\nOne day, she saw in her mirror that her father was ill, so that night she said to the Beast:\n\n“Dear Beast, you are so good to me, will you let me go home to see my father? He is ill, and he thinks that I am dead. Do let me go and cheer him up, and I will promise faithfully to return to you.”\n\n“Very well,” said the Beast kindly, “but don’t stay away more than a week, for if you do, I shall die of grief, because I love you so dearly.”\n\n“How shall I reach home?” said Beauty; “I do not know the way.”\n\nThen the Beast gave her a ring, and told her to put it on her finger when she went to bed, turn the ruby towards the palm of her hand, and then she would wake up in her father’s cottage. When she wanted to come back, she was to do the same thing.\n\nSo in the morning, when she awoke, she found herself at her father’s house, and the old man was beside himself with joy to see her safe and sound.\n\nBut her sisters did not welcome her very kindly, and when they heard how kind the Beast was to her, they envied her her good luck in living in a beautiful palace, whilst they had to be content with a cottage.\n\n“I wish we had gone,” said Marigold. “Beauty always gets the best of everything.”\n\n“Tell us all about your grand palace,” said Dressalinda, “and what you do, and how you spend your time.”\n\nSo Beauty, thinking it would amuse them to hear, told them, and their envy increased day by day. At last Dressalinda said to Marigold:\n\n“She has promised to return in a week. If we could only make her forget the day, the Beast might be angry and kill her, and then there would be a chance for us.”\n\nSo on the day before she ought to have gone back, they put, some poppy juice in a cup of wine which they gave her, and this made her so sleepy that she slept for two whole days and nights. At the end of that time her sleep grew troubled, and she dreamed that She saw the Beast lying dead among the roses in the beautiful gardens of his palace; and from this dream she awoke crying bitterly.\n\nAlthough she did not know that a week and two days had gone by since she left the Beast, yet after that dream she at once turned the ruby towards her palm, and the next morning there she was, sure enough, in her bed in the Beast’s palace.\n\nShe did not know where his rooms in the palace were, but she felt she could not wait till supper-time before seeing him, so she ran hither and thither, calling his name. But the palace was empty, and no one answered her when she called.\n\nThen she ran through the gardens, calling his name again and again, but still there was silence.\n\n“Oh! what shall I do if I cannot find him?” she said. “I shall never be happy again.”\n\nThen she remembered her dream, and ran to the rose garden, and there, sure enough, beside the basin of the big fountain, lay the poor Beast without any sign of life in him.\n\nBeauty flung herself on her knees beside him.\n\n“Oh, dear Beast,” she cried, “and are you really dead? Alas! alas! then I, too, will die, for I cannot live without you.”\n\nImmediately the Beast opened his eyes, sighed, and said:\n\n“Beauty, will you marry me?”\n\nAnd Beauty, beside herself with joy when she found that he was still alive, answered:\n\n“Yes, yes, dear Beast, for I love you dearly.”\n\nAt these words the rough fur dropped to the ground, and in place of the Beast stood a handsome Prince, dressed in a doublet of white and silver, like one made ready for a wedding. He knelt at Beauty’s feet and clasped her hands.\n\n“Dear Beauty,” he said, “nothing but your love could have disenchanted me. A wicked fairy turned me into a Beast, and condemned me to remain one until some fair and good maiden should love me well enough to marry me, in spite of my ugliness and stupidity. Now, dear one, the enchantment is broken; let us go back to my palace. You will find that all my servants—who, too, have been enchanted, and have waited on you all this long time with invisible hands—will now become visible.”\n\nSo they returned to the palace, which by this time was crowded with courtiers, eager to kiss the hands of the Prince and his bride. And the Prince whispered to one of his attendants, who went out, and in a very little time came back with Beauty’s father and sisters.\n\nThe sisters were condemned to be changed into statues, and to stand at the right and left of the palace gates until their hearts should be softened, and they should be sorry for their unkindness to their sister. But Beauty, happily married to her Prince, went secretly to the statues every day and wept over them.\n\nAnd by her tears their stony hearts were softened, and they were changed into flesh and blood again, and were good and kind for the rest of their lives.\n\nAnd Beauty and the Beast, who was a Beast no more, but a handsome Prince, lived happily ever after.\n\nAnd indeed I believe they are living happily still, in the beautiful land where dreams come true."

      "body": "Thank You For Doing The Most Important Job:\n\nI was heading to my writing group yesterday. Standing at the bus stop I decided to run back for a book to read on the journey. (Something I don’t normally do.)\n\nWhile waiting for the bus, I flicked through the pages and found my place. Because it was an old book I didn’t want to “dog-ear” the pages, so I searched in my pockets for something to use as a bookmark. All I had was a couple of ten pound notes, so I carefully folded one of them and slipped it between the pages.\n\nSitting on the bus I took the book out and was about to read but and I was distracted a young woman behind me who was speaking on her cell phone.\n\nShe was talking to her brother. She wanted to know where he was, why he wasn’t where he was supposed to be, why he had lied to their mother again and did he know that their mum had broken down in tears that morning because of him.\n\nShe kept it quiet but she didn’t pull any punches with him. She let him know exactly what she thought of him but I could tell there was love under all the disappointment. She tried so hard to get this boy/young man to come see his mother and make it all right, but I got the impression she was fighting a losing battle.\n\nI never looked around. I just stared at the book in my hand and the ten pound note sticking out of it.\n\nWhen she left the bus, I got off behind her.\n\n“Excuse me,” I said. “Do me a favour, would you? Take this money and buy your mum a box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers. And tell her a strange man said that being a mother is the hardest but most important job in the world.”\n\nI don’t think she knew how to respond to that. As I turned away I heard her softly say, “That’s really nice of you.”\n\nWalking on, I wondered at the coincidences which put that money there. I wondered if in some way I was saying a thank-you to my own mum. But most off all I hoped I had raised a smile on the face of a mother suffering for her child.\n\nBut most off all I hoped I had raised a smile on the face of a mother suffering for her child.\n\nAnd as for the son … one day, I’m sure, he’ll realise what a blessing a mother really is and what a shame it is to break her heart!"

She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed. Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. \n\nOnce the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot, and ground coffee beans in the third pot. He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter, moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. \n\nHe pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. “Daughter, what do you see?” “Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,” she hastily replied. \n\n“Look closer,” he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to her face. “Father, what does this mean?” she asked. He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same adversity– the boiling water.\n\n However, each one reacted differently. The potato went in strong, hard, and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it became soft and weak. The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard. However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.\n\n “Which are you,” he asked his daughter. “When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean? “ Moral:In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens wi"

      "body": "If I Were God:\n\nValue: God’s Nature\n\nApril and her friends often met at the ice cream shop after school to talk and hang out andhave fun. Their parents didn’t mind because the ice cream shop is near the elementaryschool and they could pick them up there. Today they were all excited about thediscussion they had in history class when the teacher was talking about the presidents ofthe country. After they had their lecture and video the teacher had a game called “If Iwere president” where everybody said what they would change if they got a chance to bepresident.\n\n“Well that was a fun game all right.” April said as she slid into the booth at the ice creamshop after school. “But if I were president, I would spend all my time on stopping wars.”“Not me.” Ginger interrupted. “In fact, I would need more power than just a presidenthas to get what I want. I would have to be God. Yeah, that’s a better game. What wouldyou do if you were God? I know what I would do. I would make sure there was neverany more mosquitoes. Ewww I hate those things.” She laughed.\n\n“Well if I were God, I would get rid of all the governments and have one government runby me.” Susanna said staring off into space. “And if anyone didn’t obey, I would justwipe out their country. That would put an end to all the wars and that stuff.”\n\nJust then, April’s little brother Stevie walked in which meant their mom had dropped himoff and would be back shortly to take April and Stevie home. Stevie was seven years old.He sat down and listened to the game.\n\n“I think if I were God, since I would have the power to do anything at all, I would firststop all the sickness and old age and bad storms and earthquakes so people all over theworld wouldn’t suffer so much.” Added Kimberly who always had a soft heart forsuffering people.\n\n“Well I don’t know. It seems to me that if everyone was a believer, we wouldn’t have somuch trouble with sin so maybe if I were God, I would just force everyone to be abeliever and then there would only be one world religion.” April said daydreaming abouthow that would be.\n\n“Don’t you think God would do that if he could, April?” Ginger said.\n\n“But God is all powerful, I wonder why he puts up with lost people and just doesn’t wipethem off the face of the earth in one wave of His hand and end all the sin and killing andawful sins people do.” April responded knowing she was unsure of what she was talkingabout and trying to remember if the answers to these questions had been covered inSunday school.\n\n“Well my uncle was lost until he received Christ last month. If God had wiped all thelost people before that, he would have gone to hell but now he is going to heaven so I amglad God didn’t do that and maybe that is why he is waiting.” Ginger said emotionallybecause she loved her uncle and all of her family.\n\n“Well if God had forced your uncle to get saved before he wiped out the rest, then hewouldn’t have gone to Hell.” Susanna added.\n\n“I am glad God didn’t force me to get saved. When I gave my heart to him, I wanted to.If he forced us, it might be like when mom and dad forces you to clean your room. Youdo it but you resent them for pushing you around. I don’t think God pushes peoplearound.” Ginger said.\n\n“Well he could if he wanted to.” April reminded everybody.\n\n“You know what I think God would do if he was God?” Stevie suddenly interrupted andeverybody laughed because of how he said that. “I think he wouldn’t be all bossy andmake anything change but I think he would come down from heaven and become ahuman so he can save the lost people because he created them to be his family and Iknow mommy and daddy would do anything to save us if April or I were lost. Theywould even give their lives to save ours.”\n\nEverybody stopped talking and just stared at Stevie. He may not have even known it buthe hit on exactly what God would do to save his children.\n\n“Not only is that what God would do Stevie,” said Kimberly, “that’s what he did do.”“What do you mean? I was just playing the game.” The little boy wondered.\n\n“She means that is what God did, when he came down as Jesus. He gave up His throneand of His powers and all of His kingship to become a poor human baby. Then he grewup here and became a teacher to teach us about Heaven. And then he went througheverything we go through so we know he understands it all. And then he let people killhim so we could be h is family and then he rose again to take us to heaven.” Kimberlycontinued.\n\n“Wow, I feel foolish for thinking He would do anything else. I should have known that.”Ginger said softly and humbly.\n\n“Me too.” Susanna added looking down at her ice cream. “Stevie how did you know allthat?”\n\n“Well,” Stevie said not knowing he had said anything smart at all. “I do listen in churchand Sunday school.”\n\n“Well girls,” April laughed. “Sounds like we need to do less gossiping and flirting andgiggling in Sunday school and do some listening.”\n\n“Yeah April.” Susanna agreed. “Then maybe we won’t find ourselves being shown up bya seven year old about how God really thinks and feels about things.\n\nApril and Stevie’s mom came and they went home to think about the conversation butStevie walked out feeling about seven foot tall because he learned something about Godand it was right."

It’s the middle of the night.” Hannah said shivering a bit from the coolnight air..\n\n“Its Lorenzo, he’s run away, we have to help them find him!” Betty said with deepconcern and worry in her voice. Lorenzo was a neighbor of Betty’s who lived severalhouses down. Many times when Hannah was over, they found Lorenzo wandering thestreets or in some strange place, just not being home. He told them things were not goodthere because his new step dad was mean to him but the girls didn’t know what to do.\n\n“How do you know he ran away?” Hannah whispered.\n\n“Officer Duncan and Youth Director Cindy came over and told my dad. Dad works atthe youth center and they have been trying to help Lorenzo.” She told her friend. It wastrue that Lorenzo had come to Officer Duncan several times. The kind policeman wantedto help more but Lorenzo would not trust him completely. Youth Director Cindy hadeven tried to come over and visit Lorenzo at home but when she got there, usuallyLorenzo was mysteriously “not here.” So all of the people who could help him mostwere frustrated because Lorenzo seemed to avoid them.\n\n“I know where he is.” Hannah suddenly said snapping her fingers. “Sabines woods! Hesaid he goes there sometimes because other people are afraid of it.” Hannah rememberedas Betty nodded knowing she was right. “Let me get some clothes on and we can go lookfor him.”\n\nThe girls entered the woods fearfully. It was so dark and their little flashlights didn’thelp much. “Lorenzo,” they tried to call out while whispering at the same time for fearthey would wake up something nasty in the woods. “Lorenzo, its Hannah and Betty,come on, come home with us.” They huddled together and whispered.\n\n“I can take you to him.” A voice said firmly and the girls yelped with surprise. Theylooked around and didn’t see anyone. “Up here sillies, on the branch.” And they lookedup and there was a very large black bird looking at them and talking.\n\n“Did you talk?” Betty asked fearfully. “I never heard a crow talk before.”\n\n“Yes I did but don’t be afraid. I am here to help you. You are looking for Lorenzo Ithink. I know where he is.” The bird said.\n\n“Oh please help us Mr. Crow, we are sorry we were afraid of you.” The girls saidtogether.\n\n“I will do it but first of all, I am a raven, not a crow. My name is Marvin the Raven.Come along then, I think he is with Grimley the groundhog. They were going to maketea. Marvin flew ahead but low and slowly so the girls could follow. Somehow a lightcame up the further into the woods they went so they could see without their flashlights.\n\n“Hannah, Betty, what are you doing here?” They suddenly heard the happy sound ofLorenzo’s voice. He came running form a clearing that was just teaming with animals,many of them walking around on their hind legs, drinking tea and talking in a mostsociable manner. Lorenzo ran to the girls and hugged them.\n\n“Lorenzo, how long have you known about all this?’ Hannah asked hugging him back.\n\n“Lots of kids come here.” He said with a big grin. “Lots of kids whose parents don’t lovethem come here because its safer here than at home. Let me introduce you to my friends.”\n\nThe next hour was amazing. They met Leonard the Llama who could quote Shakespeareflawlessly which is rare in a Llama. They met Grimley the Groundhog and his hugefamily of little baby groundhogs who loved to be petted. Grimley ideed make very goodtea. They met Morris the Unicorn who really liked Betty and let her ride him.\n\n“I didn’t know there were real unicorns much less in our woods.” Hannah said withamazement watching Betty hug Morris’s neck as she rode.\n\n“Well they keep pretty quiet and they like to be with other they feel safe around,”Lorenzo observed.\n\n“Everybody wants that.” Hannah heard herself say under her breath. After the ride.Lorenzo introduced them to a huge black bear.\n\n“Hannah and Betty, meet Rocco.” He said pointing up. The bear was easily twelve feettall, much bigger than any bear the girls had ever seen.\n\n“Pleased to meet you girls.” The bear said and then he bowed. Betty was a little afraidof him.\n\n“Don’t be afraid of Rocco, Betty.” Marvin the Raven said landing on the big bearsshoulders. Yes, he is very dangerous and anyone who would harm these woods wouldmeet with a very bad mauling from Rocco. But you are friends of Lorenzo so you willalways be safe with Rocco and with all of us here. Now Lorenzo, Rocco and I have aspecial mission to take you to meet the King and Queen of the Forest.”\n\nSo Marvin the Raven lead Rocco, Hanna, Betty on a treacherous mission to the far side ofthe forest, where even the most magical and courageous forest animals went. Theirdestination, to meet the King and Queen of the forest was by invitation only. Along theway, they crossed over streams of shimmering flowing gold only to find nearby terribledangers from falling poison podsand screaming monkeys who seem bent on stopping ordestroying the party. But one mighty roar from the mighty Rocco sent the monkeyrunning and screaming back to their lairs high in the trees.\n\nFinally, they climbed a tall hill to a clearing before a portal that was surrounded withivory pillars and majestic although sometimes spooky gargoyles. Marvin the Ravenlanded on the head of one such gargoyle and commanded all to kneel and bow so allowthe King and Queen to enter.\n\n“BEHOND THE KING AND QUEEN.” He said with majesty and they entered.\n\n“Hello Lorenzo. Girls you did a good job of saving him.” Said the very familiar voice ofthe King of the Forest.\n\n“Officer Duncan? You are the King of the Forest.” Lorenzo said with a gasp.\n\n“Hello Hannah, Hello Betty, Hello Lorenzo.” A soft female voice soothed every creaturethere.\n\n“Youth Director Cindy? How can this be?” Betty said rushing to her arms.\n\n“Its true children.” Officer Duncan said lifting Lorenzo lovingly into his strong arms.“We have known of the magic of this forest for as long as it has been here. We work inyour town to help children like Lorenzo but our roles in the magical world of Sabineswoods is a secret kept in the heart of all of its citizens. Marvin the Raven, Rocco the bearand all the rest you met last night, they serve us by loving and caring for children who arerunning from adults who hurt them. But you can trust the authorities in your lives kids.The policemen, the teachers, the church ministers you know, they are as magical as webecause they have been placed on this world by Jesus for the purpose of saving childrenthat need help, just like Lorenzo here.”\n\n“Now children, we will go to the youth center where your dad is Betty.” Queen Cindysaid taking their hands. “But you must all hold what you have learned here dear to yourheart. You are now part of this magical world and you must help bring children to us thatwe can help with their family problems. Do you swear your alliance to the secret ofSabines woods and its mission to help good children get the help they need?”\n\nAnd Lorenzo, Betty and Hannah all swore so their membership in this magical societywas made eternal. And now children, you too have become aware of the magical secretof Sabines woods. You must swear your allegiance to its secrets and to the calling Godhas on it, on you and on you parents, teachers, policemen, firemen, youth directors and allthe rest to rescue children who are in trouble and bring Gods love and peace to a troubledworld.

      "body": "This Too Shall Pass:\n\nOnce a king called upon all of his wise men and asked them, “Is there a mantra or suggestion which works in every situation, in every circumstances, in every place and in every time. In every joy, every sorrow, every defeat and every victory? One answer for all questions? Something which can help me when none of you is available to advise me? Tell me is there any mantra?”\n\nAll the wise men were puzzled by the King’s question. They thought and thought. After a lengthy discussion, an old man suggested something which appealed to all of them. They went to the king and gave him something written on paper, with a condition that the king was not to see it out of curiosity. Only in extreme danger, when the King finds himself alone and there seems to be no way, only then he can see it. The King put the papers under his Diamond ring.\n\nSome time later, the neighbours attacked the Kingdom. King and his army fought bravely but lost the battle. The King had to flee on his horse. The enemies were following him. getting closer and closer. Suddenly the King found himself standing at the end of the road – that road was not going anywhere. Underneath there was a rocky valley thousand feet deep. If he jumped into it, he would be finished…and he could not return because it was a small road… the sound of enemy’s horses was approaching fast. The King became restless. There seemed to be no way.\n\nThen suddenly he saw the Diamond in his ring shining in the sun, and he remembered the message hidden in the ring. He opened the diamond and read the message. The message was- “THIS TOO SHALL PASS”\n\nThe King read it . Again read it. Suddenly something struck him – Yes ! This too will pass. Only a few days ago, I was enjoying my kingdom. I was the mightiest of all the Kings. Yet today, the Kingdom and all his pleasure have gone. I am here trying to escape from enemies. Like those days of luxuries have gone, this day of danger too will pass. A calm came on his face. He kept standing there. The place where he was standing was full of natural beauty. He had never known that such a beautiful place was also a part of his Kingdom.\n\nThe revelation of the message had a great effect on him. He relaxed and forgot about those following him. After a few minutes he realized that the noise of the horses and the enemy coming was receding. They moved into some other part of the mountains and were near him.\n\nThe King was very brave. He reorganized his army and fought again. He defeated the enemy and regained his empire. When he returned to his empire after victory, he was received with much fanfare. The whole capital was rejoicing in the victory. Everyone was in a festive mood. Flowers were being showered on King from every house, from every corner. People were dancing and singing. For a moment King said to himself,” I am one of the bravest and greatest King. It is not easy to defeat me. With all the reception and celebration he saw an ego emerging in him.\n\nSuddenly the Diamond of his ring flashed in the sunlight and reminded him of the message. He open it and read it again: “THIS TOO SHALL PASS”.\n\nHe became silent. His face went through a total change- from the egoist he moved to a state of utter humbleness. If this too is going to pass, it is not yours.\n\nThe defeat was not yours, the victory is not yours. You are just a watcher. Everything passes by. We are witnesses of all this. We are the perceivers. Life comes and goes. Happiness comes and goes. Sorrow comes and goes.\n\nNow as you have read this story, just sit silently and evaluate your own life. This too will pass. Think of the moments of joy and victory in your life. Think of the moment of Sorrow and defeat. Are they permanent ? They all come and pass away.\n\nLife just passes away. There is nothing permanent in this world. Every thing changes except the law of change. Think over it from your own perspective. You have seen all the changes. You have survived all setbacks, all defeats and all sorrows. All have passed away. The problems in the present, they too will pass away. Because nothing remains forever. Joy and sorrow are the two faces of the same coin. They both will pass away.\n\nYou are just a witness of change. Experience it, understand it, and enjoy the present moment – this too shall pass!"

They were teasing her and laughing but Holly didn’t cry. “Cry Holly, cry.”\n\nCindy whispered under her breath hoping Holly would get the message but she didn’t.The bell rang and soon the halls were filled with kids and everyone was running out tothe bus or to get picked up by their parents in the pick up line so Cindy didn’t get achance to find out what happened. But the next day she ran up to Holly as soon as shesaw her. “Holly, I saw you talked to Rocco and Butch. I wanted to warn you aboutthem. They are really mean bullies. So be careful.”\n\nHolly just smiled a big happy smile and said “Ok Cindy. Don’t worry.”\n\nRocco saw Holly at her locker before Butch did. “Hey Butch, there’s that new girl.” Hecommented.\n\n“Something is different about her.” Butch said. But they walked toward her their usualscary walk that usually made kids run away. “Hey it’s the preacher’s kid. I bet thepreacher’s kid is the worst kid of all. That’s what they say about preacher’s children youknow.” Butch taunted her. That’s when Holly did something so unexpected that bothbullies just froze in place not knowing what to say.\n\n“Oh hi Butch. Hi Rocco. I was hoping to see you today.” And she gave them thebiggest smile either of them had ever seen. Her smile was so pretty and full of friendshipand love that they were paralyzed. “Oh, I saw you had a snickers bar in your pocketyesterday Rocco.” She continued. “We have a bunch of those so I asked mommy if Icould bring you some and she said yes and she said you sounded like super nice boys andyou can come over to play video games at our church youth night this weekend if youwant to.”\n\nThen Holly put a candy bar in each boys hand and hugged them both and ran off to classsinging a happy song and skipping.\n\n“What just happened?” Rocky said finally, when he could speak again. Butch didn’tknow but he liked it. Then when they recovered their senses, they saw what seemed to bethe whole school staring at what just happened and how a little blond girl caused themeanest bullies in the school to stop in their places and she hugged them and skippedaway singing.\n\nThe next day was more amazing yet. Instead of wandering the halls, pushing people’sbooks out of their hands and pushing girls down, Rocco and Butch went straight to Holly.And instead of those mean smirking ugly smiles that meant they were going to hurt her,they glowed as she talked to them. Cindy watched in the amazement as Holly talked tothem for several minutes during the lunch hour and at the end she hugged them again andthe two bullies went outside and didn’t bully any people for the rest of the day. That wayFriday, so everyone was so curious about what was going to happen on Monday.\n\nMonday was so amazing it was almost impossible for the kids and even the teachers tobelieve. Rocco and Butch showed up in regular clothes, not bully clothes and they weresmiling and even seemed a little shy. But when they saw Holly, they ran to her andhugged her. Cindy saw this and thought she even saw Butch cry a little bit. The bellrang and they went to class. After class, she finally got a chance to talk to Holly.\n\n“What did you do to Rocco and Butch, Holly?’ She asked eagerly.\n\n“I loved them.” Holly answered happily. “They are really very sweet. I will introduceyou to them at lunch. Rocco is way funny.” She giggled.\n\n“You loved them?” Cindy said in amazement. “But they are bullies.” She objected.“The Bible says to love your enemies and you know what amazing thing happens whenyou love your enemies Cindy?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“They stop being enemies and then you don’t have enemies any more. That’s what mydaddy taught me and what he preaches every Sunday and he does that because that iswhat Jesus taught.” Holly continued. “I invited Rocco and Butch to church and youthgroup and Sunday night they accepted Jesus and they are going to join our youth groupand instead of using their talents to hurt people, they are going to learn to go on missionstrips next summer.”\n\nAnd just as Holly said, Rocco and Butch not only stopped being bullies, they because themost popular boys in school. In fact, no bullies could do anything in Cindy’s schoolbecause Rocco and Butch knew all the bullies and wouldn’t let them hurt people andstarted sharing Jesus with them.\n\n“How did you have the courage to love them, Holly?” Cindy said with awe.“It doesn’t take courage Cindy.” Holly answered. “Its what Jesus wants us all to do so ifyou obey him and share his love with others, they will follow Jesus too and before long,everybody will love God and serve him. Wouldn’t that be so cool?”\n\nAnd Cindy had to admit. She saw it work with Rocco and Butch so what Jesus taughtabout loving enemies proved to be a truly miraculous teaching that Holly showedeverybody how to live out at their school that year."

      "body": "Fat Wally And The Piggies:\n\nValue: Christian Fellowship\n\nHi. My name is Roscoe. I’m a pig. No, no, don’t get upset. I don’t mean I am justmessy. No, I am actually a pig. I know it’s a little weird talking to a pig but hey, getused to it, lots of weird things happen around here. You probably heard someone tried totell the story of me and my brothers. I think they called that story The Three Little Pigsor some such nonsense. Well here is what really happened.\n\nSee me and my brothers, Gidney and Cloyd, well, just like you know, we all decided wewanted separate houses. Not that living together was that bad but Gidney snores so youknow. So we made a game of it and all went to the market and got the building materials.Now the truth is we all used basically the same stuff to build our homes so all that stuffabout straw houses and such, well, sometimes people get a little frisky with the truth ifyou get my meaning. No, for better or for worse, Gidney and Cloyd and I pretty muchknew what went into a new house. But the putting together part, now that’s whatstumped us.\n\nGidney loves to hang out at the at night clubs. He is a good mostly but he likes partiesand all that goes with it way too much. That is where he met Fat Wally but we will getback to him. So naturally, since all of Gidney’s friends were people at the night clubs,they all promised him and swore on whatever they could find they would be there onbuilding day. So he got his materials and tools and aprons and big tubs of lemonade andhe was already that Monday morning to get that house put up before the winter came.\n\nWell, it turned out that winter was not really the problem. See Fat Wally was one of theguys Gidney met at the club and, well to be honest, Fat Wally was a wolf. Yes WallyWolf, that’s right. And they didn’t call him FAT Wally for nothing. He got fat on lots ofsilly pigs that didn’t know how to pick their friends. Wolves, as most of you know, eatpigs pretty often and Wally thought this was a good chance to pick up a piggy stew if hegot the drop on Gidney.\n\nWell building day came and about an hour late, Gidney’s friends from the club were therebut they only knew how to party. Oh, they talked like they knew what they were goingbut big talkers are not often good workers. They slung together the most shoddy, shakyhouse you ever did see. Gidney was so disappointed in what he had when it was all overwith and all through the day, he could see Fat Wally watching from the woods. Thatnight Cloyd and I came over to play Bible Racko with Gidney and we could barely dealthe cards when that house started to go.\n\n“Hey Piggies.” Fat Wally yelled from the woods. “Pretty bad job on the house. Noproblem. I will help you clean it up when it falls and then I will eat you.” He yelled.Big talker.\n\n“NO CHANCE FATSO!” Gidney yelled back. I know, he should have said “not by thehair of my chinny chin chin” but the house was falling. He had to make it fast. We madeit out the window and down the pathway before it fell. It crashed and we could hear FatWally looking for our bodies in the rubble.\n\nCloyd wasn’t quite the partier but he went to a church that didn’t believe in Jesus andtaught something about a spaceship landing and taking them all to a planet that was kindof like heaven or something like that. They were pretty spooky but Cloyd hung out withthem and just like the party people, they were sure they could help Cloyd with his house.But they showed up and started lighting candles and trying to talk to dead people and dospells that went nowhere and by morning the only thing up was one room because Cloydand Gidney did that. Gidney had time on his hands what with no house left after all.\n\nFat Wally liked the look of this real well. Sure, the spaceship people saw him but theywere sure the aliens were going to come down, kill the wolf and finish the construction sothey didn’t have to worry. They sure were confident in the spaceship people. Well thetime came and they started chanting in a circle waiting for the spaceship to land. Wellwhen they opened their eyes, were there aliens in the circle? You guessed it, Fat Wallywas in the circle and he chased them for what seemed like hours. They ran every whichway knocking down that badly done shack and sending everyone screaming into thewoods. Amazingly or maybe Fat Wally is just a really terrible hunter, he didn’t catchanyone so he was pretty hungry by then.\n\nGidney and Cloyd both were pretty scared when they met me at the Methodist Church forWednesday night worship. Afterward we made plans for my house and they would livewith me which isn’t that great because after all, Gidney snores but we already talkedabout that. I had about twenty of my good Christian brothers lined up to help and theywere there right on time. We got that house up and it was rock solid. Fat Wally watchednervously from the woods but he knew this was his last chance with us.\n\nHe waited until we had finished and were having snacks in the living room of mywonderful new home.\n\n“Hey piggies, how about a snack for Fat Wally? One of your fat friends would be a nicetreat.”\n\n“NO CHANCE FATSO.” Gidney yelled out.\n\n“Gidney, shush” I said. “No need for that. We have God’s blessing on this house. Theevil one cannot harm us here.” So Gidney, Cloyd and me and my church brothers andsisters began reading the bible and having so much fun discussing the word of God,everyone almost forgot about Fat Wally.\n\nBut I heard him coming. Step Step Step. He was trying to sneak in for an attack. Hewas hoping for panic like he got from the spaceship people. He didn’t get it. We justjoined our hands and started singing.\n\n“Jesus loves me this I know…” we sang getting louder and louder until all of a sudden.\n\n“OW OW OW.” The fat old wolf started howling. “I can’t stand it. I just can attack youwhen you are praising God like that!” Fat Wally went howling into the woods holdinghis big ears, crying and bumping into trees. And I expect as little as he got to eat thatday, he probably is now known as Skinny Wally.\n\nWell so you know, Gidney gave up night clubs and Cloyd quit the spaceship peoplechurch and we all worship Jesus now. We got their houses up and learned a reallyimportant lesson. We learned that your Christian brothers and sisters are who you woulddepend on and spend time with and we learned that the evil one cannot hurt us when weare in unity in the faith and are serving and worshiping Christ together. So when you arehaving fun with your friends in Sunday School, keep your eyes open for Fat Wally. Ifyou see him, remember don’t yell NO CHANCE FATSO at him. Just worship Jesus andhe can never hurt you."

Chuck wasred with anger at his little boy for what he read in that diary.\n\n“How dare you lie to me? You said you would never smoke a cigarette and right here inthis diary, you confess you have. Your promises are no good to me now Max!” Chuckyelled at his young son.\n\n“Well my privacy is ruined. How I can ever trust you again!” Max said crying.\n\n“Me? Its you who lied and I can never trust you again. I wish I never had a son.” Chucksaid and right away he was sorry he said that. Max burst into tears and ran out the doorto go down the block to his friends house to hide. Chuck slammed his hand down on thecounter and hurt it. He hated fighting with his son. Parents hate it when their childrenare mad at them. It hurts them way down inside but sometimes they are proud and don’tknow how to make things are ok.\n\n“That kid drives me crazy.” Chuck fumed thinking of what he read in that diary. “Lethim go. I will just take a nap.” And with that Chuck laid down on his sofa and wentsoundly to sleep.\n\nChuck woke up suddenly and looked around. It wasn’t his bedroom but some otherplace. He was on a flat white stone sleeping and there was no furniture and everythingwas dark all around him.\n\n“Fluffy, where are you fluffy?” Chuck heard a familiar sound.\n\n“Grandpa?” Chuck said as the elderly man walked past him looking for his dog. He saidcurious of how this could be considering Chuck’s grandfather went to be with Jesus longago.\n\n“Why hello little Chucky, are you ok?”\n\n“Yes Grandpa, just didn’t expect to see you. Where are we?”\n\n“Well I am in heaven. I am looking for our dog Fluffy. You remember Fluffy? Youloved him so much. Well he is here now and he still likes to run away. Where are youFluffy! Say, I am not sure why you are here. Is something wrong Chucky?”\n\n“Well I sort of had a fight with Max and I guess that is on my mind. Oh yeah, Max is myson, your great grandson. He looks a lot like you Grandpa.”\n\n“Aww, well I am sure he is a spark plug like you and your dad were growing up. Listen,the only regret I have from my life is that I went to heaven with some people who had notforgiven me. You probably don’t know this that when I died, I was not speaking to yourmother, my daughter. It was something silly now that I look back on it but I wish I hadapologized and got past it so I could have hugged her before….”\n\n“ARF ARF.”\n\n“Oh there you are Fluffy. Gotta run now. I have to get Fluffy home. Grandma is waitingsupper on us.” Chuck’s grandfather said and then he was gone. Chuck didn’t knowexactly what to make of it when he looked up and a large powerful man walked past himas he sat on the slab. The man walked like he had someplace important to go and did notlook to the right or left.\n\n“Dad?” Chuck said with amazement. The big man stopped in his tracks and looked atChuck curiously.\n\n“Son? Is that you? What are you doing here? Wait a minute. Are you asleep?” The bigman asked.\n\n“Well no Dad. Well, ummm, yes, I think so.” Chuck confessed.\n\n“I thought so.” Chuck’s deceased father said with his big barrel laugh. “Ok spill it, whatdid you do wrong. When you were a kid, you always took a nap when you had donesomething wrong.”\n\n“Well, it’s Max. He and I had a fight. I read his diary which was wrong but found out helied to me which made me really mad and now I can’t forgive him.” Chuck told hisfather, the one guy he could always talk to.\n\n“Chuck do you think you have ever been forgiven?” His Dad asked.\n\n“Well, by you maybe, a few times.”\n\n“Try 10,316 times Chuck. But that’s not what I mean. Who forgave you of everythingand made it possible for you to go to heaven?”\n\nChuck thought for a moment and then he remembered his Sunday school classes when hewas a child. “JESUS. That’s it isn’t it? He died on the cross so I could be forgiven.”\n\nChuck said with excitement for getting the right answer.\n\n“That’s right Chuck. God forgave us all of lots worse things than Max has done. And ifHe was willing to give his life for our forgiveness. It’s the least you can do to forgiveMax, ask his forgiveness too. Do it now son, before it’s too late.” And with that Chuck’sdad stood and began to fade out.\n\n“Wait dad, I wanted to ask you about how to build a shed.”\n\n“No time now son. I have to go. Have you seen your Grandpa? He just stepped out towalk Fluffy.” And he was gone.\n\nSuddenly Chuck woke up with a start. He realized he was home now but the visits fromhis ancestors had not been for nothing. Suddenly he heard the door to the house open.“Max is that you?”\n\nMax entered the room looking very sad and staring down. Chuck stood up and put hishands on his shoulders and just said, “I’m sorry.” To stop themselves from crying (whichmen don’t like to do), Chuck and Max hugged and Chuck knew he would never let somelittle issue come between him and his son again."

But daddy always loved to do it so they went to learnhow. Usually the Assistant Pastor from their church went along. Mostly people werenice and sometimes invited them in and sometimes the Pastor or Daddy would pray withthe people to accept Jesus and that was really exciting.\n\nOne time though a man answered the door who wasn’t from our country. His skin wasdarker and he wore one of those turban things on his head. And when daddy sharedabout Jesus, the man got really mad and started yelling and seemed like he was going tocome out and hurt daddy so the Pastor excused them from the man and they went to abench nearby in the apartment complex.\n\n“What was wrong with that man Daddy? Why did he have that hat on his head?” Phillipasked frightened.\n\n“That is a man God loves just like he loves you and me Phillip. Now let’s pray for him.”And they did right there on the bench and they all felt better.\n\nThat night Daddy explained that the man was from another religion so he just didn’tunderstand that they were there to give him eternal life. “But Daddy,” Phillip interrupted.“It seemed like he wanted to hurt us. Does that mean what we were doing was wrong?”\n\n“Kids do remember the story of Stephen in the Bible?” Daddy said and before they knewit, Daddy was telling them the story. Daddy was an amazing storyteller because he wasable to make Julie and Phillip feel like they were right there in the story.\n\n“Where are we Daddy?” Phillip shook his head looking around at the huge crowd ofwhat seemed to be really angry people. Phillip and Julie felt their Daddy holding ontotheir hands as he took them right into the bible story he was telling.\n\n“We are in the story, Phillip. These people are all angry with Stephen. See over there?”The children worked their way between the legs of the shouting people and then they sawhim. Standing apart from the crowd, dressed all in white. “Phillip!” Julie whispered.\n\n“That’s Stephen, just like Daddy said.”\n\n“Kids over here.” They heard their Daddy whisper and they ran to him knelt betweensome people watching.\n\n“Why are they all so mad Daddy?” Asked Julie a little scared and nervous for Stephen.“They don’t want him to share about Jesus, sweetie.” Her Daddy answered.“Daddy, he doesn’t even look scared. I would be SO scared if everybody was mad atme.” Phillip said watching Stephen with amazement.\n\n”Can you hear what he is saying kids?” Daddy whispered and they listened close.“He is praising Jesus Daddy.” Julie finally said. “He is thanking Jesus that he is going tobe able to suffer and die for God. Daddy I don’t understand.” She said sobbing a littlebit.\n\n“Well honey, Jesus died for us so it’s a privilege to go through those things for him.Stephen is full of the Holy Ghost so he isn’t suffering at all. See his face, it’s full of joy.That’s what the Holy Spirit does when we go through hard things for Jesus. He replacesthe fear and pain with joy and praise. Come on, we better get back, Mommy will havesupper ready soon.”\n\nAs they moved to the back of the crowd, Julie saw a wrap that looked like it belonged toStephen. She reached to pick it up but an older boy picked it up first. She looked him inthe eyes.\n\n“Why are you crying?” She asked the boy.\n\n“I have always hated Christians, little girl” the boy said. “But Stephen has so much joy.The joy of Stephen makes me somehow want that in my heart.”\n\nBack home at the supper table they told Mommy all about their adventure. “Well, Julie,who was that boy you talked to before you came home.”\n\n“I don’t know Mommy.

      "body": "The Weight Of The Glass:\n\nOnce upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students.  As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they’d be asked the typical “glass half empty or glass half full” question.  Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, “How heavy is this glass of water I’m holding?”\n\nStudents shouted out answers ranging from eight ounces to a couple pounds.\n\nShe replied, “From my perspective, the absolute weight of this glass doesn’t matter.  It all depends on how long I hold it.  If I hold it for a minute or two, it’s fairly light.  If I hold it for an hour straight, its weight might make my arm ache a little.  If I hold it for a day straight, my arm will likely cramp up and feel completely numb and paralyzed, forcing me to drop the glass to the floor.  In each case, the weight of the glass doesn’t change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it feels to me.”\n\nAs the class shook their heads in agreement, she continued, “Your stresses and worries in life are very much like this glass of water.  Think about them for a while and nothing happens.  Think about them a bit longer and you begin to ache a little.  Think about them all day long, and you will feel completely numb and paralyzed – incapable of doing anything else until you drop them.”\n\nThe moral:  It’s important to remember to let go of your stresses and worries.  No matter what happens during the day, as early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down.  Don’t carry them through the night and into the next day with you.  If you still feel the weight of yesterday’s stress, it’s a strong sign that it’s time to put the glass down."

      "body": "All The Difference In The World:\n\nEvery Sunday morning I take a light jog around a park near my home.  There’s a lake located in one corner of the park.  Each time I jog by this lake, I see the same elderly woman sitting at the water’s edge with a small metal cage sitting beside her.\n\nThis past Sunday my curiosity got the best of me, so I stopped jogging and walked over to her.  As I got closer, I realized that the metal cage was in fact a small trap.  There were three turtles, unharmed, slowly walking around the base of the trap.  She had a fourth turtle in her lap that she was carefully scrubbing with a spongy brush.\n\n“Hello,” I said.  “I see you here every Sunday morning.  If you don’t mind my nosiness, I’d love to know what you’re doing with these turtles.”\n\nShe smiled.  “I’m cleaning off their shells,” she replied.  “Anything on a turtle’s shell, like algae or scum, reduces the turtle’s ability to absorb heat and impedes its ability to swim.  It can also corrode and weaken the shell over time.”\n\n“Wow!  That’s really nice of you!” I exclaimed.\n\nShe went on: “I spend a couple of hours each Sunday morning, relaxing by this lake and helping these little guys out.  It’s my own strange way of making a difference.”\n\n“But don’t most freshwater turtles live their whole lives with algae and scum hanging from their shells?” I asked.\n\n“Yep, sadly, they do,” she replied.\n\nI scratched my head.  “Well then, don’t you think your time could be better spent?  I mean, I think your efforts are kind and all, but there are fresh water turtles living in lakes all around the world.  And 99% of these turtles don’t have kind people like you to help them clean off their shells.  So, no offense… but how exactly are your localized efforts here truly making a difference?”\n\nThe woman giggled aloud.  She then looked down at the turtle in her lap, scrubbed off the last piece of algae from its shell, and said, “Sweetie, if this little guy could talk, he’d tell you I just made all the difference in the world.”\n\nThe moral:  You can change the world – maybe not all at once, but one person, one animal, and one good deed at a time.  Wake up every morning and pretend like what you do makes a difference.  It does."

But later, the dog is back again.dog coming inside the shop. He shoos him away. But later, the dog is back again.\n\nSo, he goes over to the dog and notices he has a note in his mouth. He takes the note and it reads “Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please. The\ndog has money in his mouth, as well.”\n\nThe butcher looks inside and, lo and behold, there is a ten dollar Note there. So he takes the money and puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, placing it in the dog’s mouth. The butcher is so impressed, and since it’s about closing time, he decides to shut up shop and follow the dog.\n\nSo off he goes. The dog is walking down the street when he comes To a level crossing. The dog puts down the bag, jumps up and presses the button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the lights to turn. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following him all the way.\n\nThe dog then comes to a bus stop, and starts looking at the timetable.\n\nThe butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks out the times, and then sits on one of the seats provided. Along comes a bus. The dog walks around to the front, looks at the number, and goes back to his seat.\n\nAnother bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the number, notices it’s the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher, by now, open-mouthed, follows him on to the bus.\n\nThe bus travels through the town and out into the suburbs, the dog looking at the scenery. Eventually he gets up, and moves to the front of the bus. He stands on 2 back paws and pushes the button to stop the bus. Then he gets off, his groceries still in his mouth.\n\nWell, dog and butcher are walking along the road, and then the dog turns into a house. He walks up the path, and drops the groceries on the step.\n\nThen he walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself against the door. He goes back down the path, runs up to the door and again, it throws himself against it. There’s no answer at the house, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. He gets to the window, and beats his head against it several times, walks back, jumps off, and waits at the door.\n\nThe butcher watches as a big guy opens the door, and starts abusing the dog, kicking him and punching him, and swearing at him.\n\nThe butcher runs up, and stops the guy. “What in heaven’s name are You doing? The dog is a genius. He could be on TV, for the life of me!” to which the guy responds: “You call this clever? This is the second time this week that this stupid dog’s forgotten his key.”\n\nReflection:\n\nLOOKS LIKE SOME, PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE SATISFIED WITH WHAT THEY’VE GOT.\n\nWhen it comes to the work place, Employers do not know how to appreciate their people who have served them loyally through the years. I’ve seen companies lose good people for the simple fact their leaders failed to show appreciation. Employers with big egos enjoy the fact that they have more power and authority than others. They show, in the way they give orders and directions, that they think they are superior. They get a kick out of displaying this superiority. People who do this are fools, and everyone but them knows it. They are never satisfied because they could not be satisfied even if their people perform well.\n\nThey don’t listen to the opinion and ideas of their subordinates. Why? Because of their stupid pride and insecurity.\n\nPeople of this kind will never be satisfied. Why? Because they are so busy wrapped up in themselves and, fact is, the self can never be satisfied. Happy and productive people are always those who are “others-centered” rather than “self- centered.”\n\nTHE GREATEST IDEA OF LEADERSHIP IS NOT SOMEONE WHO THROWS HIS WEIGHT AROUND. RATHER, HE IS A SERVANT. AS BIBLE WOULD SAY, “HE WHO WISH TO BE A LEADER SHOULD FIRST BE A SERVANT.”\n\nHis joy is derived from delivering a job that others benefit from his contribution. Aim for service and success will follow."

He was so famous that everyone called him thePrince of Thieves. Well, you know back in the old days, before we had our nice churchesand such, Christianity was protected by monks. Monks are people who live together allalone in a far away place and pray and serve God. You usually see pictures of them inlong brown robes.\n\nBrother Andrew was a little different from his fellow monks because he loved the out ofdoors so much and the sea. He often camped on the beach not far from the monetarywhere all the monks lived. But he did good things, keeping the beach clean and fishingand farming which provided food for the other monks so it was God’s calling for him tobe on the beach. Especially the day the Prince of Thieves landed on those shores.\n\nCaptain Black spotted the island of the monks just ahead. He was pleased as he had hisentire fortune on board. It was an ingenious plan to hide his booty on the monk’s island,as nobody would look for it there. He was the wealthiest pirate of them all and his menwere fiercely loyal to him. He gave the command to his men to prepare to land on theisland. He would let all of his men go to the beach in small boats, leaving his big pirateship in deep water. They would unload it tomorrow after they were rested.\n\nBrother Andrew stood and looked into the setting sun. He saw the small boats makingtheir way toward his beach. But he did not panic. He added more vegetables to his stewand more wood on his fire for the night.\n\n“Ahoy Brother Andrew!” Captain Black called to his old friend.\n\n“Blessings Brother Black!” The monk responded. Captain Black liked Brother Andrewbecause he wasn’t afraid of him and always greeted him with blessings. Some of thenewer pirates were wary of the young monk but soon all accepted him because theircaptain clearly trusted him. Moreover, what was amazing about it was that the monktrusted the notorious pirate.\n\n“Arrr, I thought Christian folk despised low lives like us pirates.” Scalawag Sam said toBrother Andrew as the brother served him more stew. “I figured the good people of theworld thought we were better off not being in heaven.”\n\n“Well Sam,” Brother Andrew answered smiling. “You have your prince of thieves butthe church has someone like Captain Blood but we call him the Prince of Peace. And hecame to earth to do all he can to make sure you and your friends all DO go to heaven. Hecame to earth just for you and all your crimes and sins have already been forgiven by himso you can meet him and start your journey to heaven anytime you want. See God lovesyou just as much as he does me or the monks or any Christian in this world.”\n\n“I never heard anyone say they loved me much less that God did.” The confused piratesaid moving off to sit on the beach and eat and think about what he heard that day. Themen all found places to bunk down for the night. But Brother Andrew and Captain Blacktalked by the fire.\n\n“You should come with us Brother Andrew.” The captain invited. The men all like youand you would be the richest monk in the world.”\n\n“I do not need riches. They would take too much time to watch and worry about.Serving God is best done without riches.” He responded.\n\n“I have all I need. I have the love and friendship of my heavenly father which will last aneternity. I have the community of brothers, the love of the townspeople and even thefriendship of notorious pirates. I have the secret I know about the pirates that the worlddoes not know. I know that even ‘low lives’ as they call you are good men at heart, withloyalty and friendship to give and hungry hearts to know more about God and HisKingdom.”\n\n“Ah you do have a secret and I’ll wager its one no one would believe from you. I mustmake do with fabulous wealth that is more than a king could ask for and the devotion andloyalty of my men.” Said the Captain toasting the monk who he considered one of hisclosest friends.\n\nSuddenly, on board the deserted ship, a lantern left burning in the weapons room feelwhen its cord broke. The fire lit a small blaze that moved directly into the gunpowderroom.\n\nThe explosion on the horizon lit up the entire sea like daytime. Captain Black leapt to hisfeet and all of his men were suddenly wide awake and yelling in panic as they watchedtheir ship go up in flames. There was another explosion and then another and with each,the captain cried out like he was being struck with bullets Brother Andrew ran to his aidand helped him to the ground as he and the pirates watched the ship and all of his wealthsink to the bottom of the deep blue sea.\n\n“My booty! My wealth! My gold! It’s all gone.” Captain Black moaned. He looked atBrother Andrew who stayed close to his friend’s side knowing he must be going throughso much anguish. “Well, at least I have my loyal men. Together we can build againand….” But when the captain looked up, the men were all gone. They had taken theboats and were already on their way to find the next rich pirate captain to serve.“It looks like your men were only loyal to your wealth. That is not true faithfulness.”Brother Andrew observed.\n\n“I need a treasure that cannot be sent to the bottom of the ocean Brother Andrew.” Thecaptain said to his friend. “And I need a crew that is faithful to me, not to my gold. Butis that possible?”\n\n“Yes, there is a friend that is closer than any brother and will never leave you or forsakeyou. His name is Jesus Christ and he is the Prince of Peace, the perfect savior for theprince of thieves. I will take you to him and he will show you a wealth that is greaterthan a thousand ships can carry. And it is a treasure that is kept for you in heaven, whereno fire, explosion or thieves can ever touch it because it is protected by God himself.”\n\nThe monk’s words put life inside of the old tired pirate and the thing nobody could expecthappened. Captain Black became Brother Black, the newest monk in the monetary.From that day forward, there were two monks on the beach offering food, friendship andthe gospel to the dark pirates and many “low lives” came to know Christ because ofBrother Black and Brother Andrew. But never again did the notorious pirate CaptainBlack sail the seas for that was the end of the Prince of Thieves."

Terrance wasa toucan and since he was pretty sure he was very pretty, he felt sure everybody thoughtthat they were pretty. But in his private thoughts, he did think Horace was pretty awfullooking. Horace was a hippo.\n\n“Well my mom always said I was pretty but then again, she was a hippo too. Terrance,hippos are just not pretty. Not like giraffes or peacocks at least.” He said jealously.\n\n“Ok, well if you could pick one thing about a giraffe that you would want, what would itbe?” Terrance said. Terrance, like all toucans, could cause wishes to come true for thepeople who they love or like a lot. That’s why people like having toucans for pets. Itisn’t because they are nice birds. It's the dream granting thing that makes them great.\n\n“Well if my neck was long and elegant, why all the pretty giraffes would love me and Iwould have tons of friends then.” Horace said his voice full of envy.\n\n“Ok, it’s yours.” Terrance said, he flapped his wings wide and then said ‘BAKKAH!”which is the spell.\n\n“Hey, HEY what’s happening?” Horace said in a panic as he felt his big hippo headbegin to shoot high into the sky under the most beautiful giraffe neck that was growingfrom his hippo body. When stopped, Horace stood there not really knowing what to dowith this much neck. Then, slowly at first and then faster, his head began to sway backand forth like an out of control carnival ride. His big hippo head was too heavy for thattiny neck. All of a sudden, it toppled downward. All around the jungle, the animalsheard Horace yelling for help as the ground grew closer and closer and then WUMP! Ithit the ground.\n\n“Murmph mr murtle mu” Terrance heard his friend say.\n\n“Just a moment, let me get your head out of the sand.” The toucan said and he pulledHorace’s head back until it popped back into the air and he laid it on its side with that biggiraffe neck just winding everywhere back to his body.\n\n“This isn’t working Terrance. Not only is it dangerous, I think I look foolish with thishuge neck attacked to my big fat head.\n\n“BAKKAH” Terrance squawked and Horace was himself again.\n\n“I still want to be pretty. Like the Pelican with those beautiful long legs. They can evensleep on just one leg. I wish I could do that,” he said lifting one of his squatty hippo legsand then putting down before he fell.\n\n“Ok, let’s try that.” Terrance said and out went his wings “BAKKAH”. Said the birdand the spell took effect.\n\n“Here we go again.” Horace said gasping as he shot into the air with his legs growinglong and skinny under him. When he stopped, he was standing tall enough to see overthe grass. He peered down at his four pelican legs quivering trying to hold up hismassive hippo weight. “Wow, Terrance, my legs are so pretty.” Horace said withadmiration and he started to walk toward the marshes where the other pelicans stayed.But the pelicans didn’t see Horace as pretty because of his long legs.\n\n“Yikes!” many screamed and took flight thinking it was some kind of monster. Other’slaughed thinking Horace had come up with a strange costume. Others ran to him withBand-Aids thinking he was the scene of a terrible collision between a bird and a hippo.\n\n“Oh Terrance, nothing is working.” Horace said bitterly.\n\n“BAKKAH” Terrance said flapping his wings and Horace was back to normal.\n\n“How will I ever stop being ugly?” He said with great sadness in his heart.\n\n“Horace I told you before, you are already pretty. When you say you are ugly, you insultGod our creator. Way back in the beginning of time he made hippos. He made toucansand pelicans and giraffes and even humans and each of them was perfectly made for whatGod wanted them to be. We are not made to look pretty to each other. Look to yourfriends, the hippos and be at peace that you are what God made you to be. Envy is a wayof saying ‘God you did a bad job’ and that makes God very sad indeed.” The wise birdcounseled his friend.\n\n“Well I don’t want God to be sad. I want to be all He made me to be, not what he madesomeone else to be. I want to be the best Horace the Hippo he ever made.” Horace saidhis big hippo chest sticking out proudly.\n\n“Oh Horace?” Horace and Terrance both heard a melodic female voice sing out. Justthen, Henrietta Hippo stepped from behind the grasses. “Will you take me to thewaterfall today?” she said looking at him with big eyes that were full of admiration.\n\n“Wow, she is pretty.” Horace said to Terrance and then he waddled her way doing adance to make himself more pretty to her. Off they went as Terrance looked on inamazement.\n\n“Thos are two ugly hippos,” he said to himself. Then he flew back to his tree to see ifthere was a pretty toucan there who might like a trip to the waterfall too."

They loved the pretty dresses and hats they got to wearand all the ladies at church wore. They loved the story of Jesus rising from the dead andthe flowers and the candy and of course, the Easter Bunny and Easter egg hunts. Usuallyon Saturday, they went to the one in Central Park with all the kids. Mommy and Daddyalways hid lost of eggs all over the house and in the garden.\n\nOne of Amy and Ambers favorite things to do is to get up really early on Easter morningand go out in the garden and find all the eggs Mommy and Daddy hid there last nightbefore their parents ever even got up. They always surprised Mommy and Daddy withfull baskets of Easter eggs already gathered before they even woke up.\n\nThis year they did extra good because Amy and Amber got up just before the sun cameup. The quickly got into their Easter robes and slippers and tried to be quiet for all thegiggling as they slipped into the garden. Mommy kept a huge garden that had rows androws of flowers and plants and paths that went back to some land Daddy used to dumpthe trimmings when he mowed the lawn. Amy searched for eggs around the lily pondand Amber near the Azalea bushes when Amber suddenly called to her twin sister.\n\n“Amy come here. I have never seen this path before.” Amy ran to her sister and sawwhat she had found. It was a new path but it didn’t look new. It looked very old becauseit was laid in with huge granite stones and it rose like it was going up a hill which none ofthe others did. Amber was a little nervous about following the strange path but beforeshe knew it Amy started stepping up the stones and moving further up the hill so Amberjoined her. Both were very curious about this Easter mystery.\n\nThe path wound around and twisted but it was always an uphill climb until suddenly itleveled out and they were in a clearing. “What is this place Amber?” whispered Amyand the girls held hands as they bravely explored further. As they walked in tiny littlesteps, suddenly Amber stopped.\n\n“Look at that.” She said and Amy saw what she saw. It was a huge cave and there was amassive stone lying on the ground and there was stuff lying around like someone hadbeen here and run away. Just then, the sun peeked over the eastern horizon and at thatsame exact moment, a light burst from the cave door that was brighter than the sunrise.“Amy,” Amber said with a frightened, shy whisper, “do you think this is the….”\n\n“I don’t know Amber.” Amy whispered back “Let’s go see.”\n\nSlowly they inched forward until they were at the opening of the cave. They peekedaround and there He was. Sitting on the edge of a large slab looking at his hands andpraying, dressed all in white with strips of grave wrapping lying at his feet, he waspreparing to stand up.”\n\n“Jesus?” Amber said in awe, shock and feeling the love she had for him come up. Asshe said that, Jesus looked at her and smiled a smile that made them know it could onlybe him and that the love of God was bursting from him.\n\n“Hello Amy and Amber.” He said in his soft loving voice. Then he extended his arms.\n\n“Come see me.”\n\nThe twins ran to their Savior and jumped into his arms. “Jesus did you just get rose fromthe dead?” Amy said kissing the backs of his hands.\n\n“Yes Amy.” Jesus answered and they felt the joy that was in him flowing to them. Forwhat seemed like hours he talked to them about how much he loved them and how muchhe loved his disciples and all sinners and that he came to earth to take everyone wholoved him to Heaven.\n\n“Now girls, I must go see my disciples. I want you to go back down the hill to yourparents and then go out and tell everyone you know about what you saw here and that Irose from the dead to give them eternal life so they will never die. Promise?”\n\n“WE PROMISE JESUS” and they kissed him and they ran out of the cave passing twoladies who were coming up the path. Then they ran all the way home and there wasmommy making her special Easter breakfast. But Amy and Amber never forgot to telleveryone about Jesus and how he rose from the dead to save us. And we should neverforget the true meaning of Easter either and tell everyone we know of the amazingmiracle of Easter morning."

All of theShepherds looked on in wonder as they heard from the choir of angels that filled the nightsky of the coming of the Messiah, the Christ Child, Jesus who would save his peoplefrom their sins.David watched from the hill not far from the flock and his uncle and dad who weretending the sheep. He had been coming out with his male relatives to learn how to be ashepherd under their care and teaching. \n\nThey had sent him off to find a lost baby sheepthat had wandered off. David knew exactly where the little scoundrel sheep was becausehe had chased her many times. He had given the sheep a name, Spunky and it hadbecome David’s special pet in all the herd.As the Angel Choir finished, David heard Spunky baa not far from where he was sitting.\n\nSpunky liked a little cove where some sweet herbs grew and only she knew about them.But she must have gotten caught in the brambles. Sure enough, there she was, all caughtup and very unhappy.“Oh Spunky, you get in trouble every time you come up here. What would you dowithout me?” David said happily, as he helped her get loose and she began to play abouthis legs and feet.“Wow, is that a sheep?” David heard the small voice not far off.“Who’s there?” He said nervously.\n\n As he looked around, a child, seemingly a few yearsyounger than him stepped from the shadows. She was dressed all in white. But whatreally stood out is that she had wings on her back and a ring glowing on her brow, notlike a headband, slightly above her brow and her whole gown glowed in the dark. “Whoare you?” David said but he found he was not afraid so he approached her.“Shhhh, I slipped out of the choir. \n\nI wanted to see what it was like, you know, here.” Shesaid and she ran to Spunky and started petting her.“The choir? You mean, in the sky?” David gasped.“Yes, wasn’t that pretty? I sang a while but I can’t really do much so I slipped out.” Shesaid her angels wings spreading as she played with the lamb.“Hello, my name is David.” David politely introduced himself. “You’re an angel?” Hesaid and he knelt down and looked at her face.“Yes, my name is Shauna. You’re a human?” She said and for a moment, they juststared because neither had ever been this close to someone like that.\n\n Suddenly Davidjumped up and laughed.“Then let’s play!” He declared running to a tree and jumping to the branch for a catapult.“YAY!” Shauna giggled with delight and before she knew it, her wings carried her to thetree limb and she looked down and teased her new friend from her perch.“No fair!” he declared but no time to fuss. \n\nThe new friends, an angel girl and a shepherdboy ran and laughed and played for what seemed like hours in the hills just outside ofBethlehem, not very far from where the Baby Jesus was just born.David ran ahead followed closely by Spunky and then Shauna who took flight from timeto time and then landed running as fast as she could keep up when David splashed into acold running stream laughing and slinging water back at the lamb and the angel. “Tag”David teased Shauna, “You’re it.”Shauna was laughing and ducking enjoying every second because so much of this shenever experienced in Heaven. Suddenly a sound like a trumpet was heard in the sky notfar from where the Angel Choir sang its heavenly songs.“David, I have to go home now. We all have to back to Heaven now.” Shauna saidsadly.“But I don’t want you to go. You are my friend, can I go with you?” David begged.“No David. \n\nI am an Angel. My job will be to do God’s Will in heaven. I will praise himand help people when He sends me to help them.” She said lifting slightly into the air onher small wings.“But I like those jobs. Maybe I can be an angel.” David objected.“You have an even more important job David.” The Angel Child told him. Down inBethlehem the Christ Child has been born.\n\n You must take the news of His salvation toeveryone. Go to the valley and see Him David. His name is Jesus and only you, a humanboy can tell other human boys and girls about Jesus. So go. I will always be near youbecause now that we have met, I will be your guardian angel.” And then she mysteriously disappeared.\n\n“How will I know you are near by?” He shouted at the sky.Just then, a big splash of water flew up from the stream and hit him in the face. He heardher voice near the stream. “Tag.” She said with a giggle. “You’re it.” She said. Davidlaughed and turned and started to run to Bethlehem to see the miracle of the Christ Child,the Miracle of Christmas."

      "body": "The Fruit Seller From Kabul:\n\nMy five years’ old daughter Mini cannot live without chattering. I really believe that in all her life she has not wasted a minute in silence. Her mother is often vexed at this, and would stop her prattle, but I would not. To see Mini quiet is unnatural, and I cannot bear it long. And so my own talk with her is always lively. One morning, for instance, when I was in the midst of the seventeenth chapter of my new novel, my little Mini stole into the room, and putting her hand into mine, said: “Father! Ramdayal the door-keeper calls a crow a krow!\n\nHe doesn’t know anything, does he?” Before I could explain to her the differences of language in this world, she was embarked on the full tide of another subject. “What do you think, Father? Bhola says there is an elephant in the clouds, blowing water out of his trunk, and that is why it rains!” And then, darting off anew, while I sat still making ready some reply to this last saying, “Father! what relation is Mother to you?”\n\n“My dear little sister in the law!” I murmured involuntarily to myself, but with a grave face contrived to answer: “Go and play with Bhola, Mini! I am busy!”\n\nThe window of my room overlooks the road. The child had seated herself at my feet near my table, and was playing softly, drumming on her knees. I was hard at work on my seventeenth chapter, where Protrap Singh, the hero, had just caught Kanchan Lata, the heroine, in his arms, and was about to escape with her by the third story window of the castle, when all of a sudden Mini left her play, and ran to the window, crying, “A Cabuliwallah! a Cabuliwallah!” Sure enough in the street below was a Cabuliwallah, passing slowly along. He wore the loose soiled clothing of his people, with a tall turban; there was a bag on his back, and he carried boxes of grapes in his hand.\n\nI cannot tell what were my daughter’s feelings at the sight of this man, but she began to call him loudly. “Ah!” I thought, “he will come in, and my seventeenth chapter will never be finished!” At which exact moment the Cabuliwallah turned, and looked up at the child. When she saw this, overcome by terror, she fled to her mother’s protection, and disappeared. She had a blind belief that inside the bag, which the big man carried, there were perhaps two or three other children like herself. The peddler meanwhile entered my doorway, and greeted me with a smiling face.\n\nSo precarious was the position of my hero and my heroine, that my first impulse was to stop and buy something, since the man had been called. I made some small purchases, and a conversation began about Abdurrahman, the Russians, she English, and the Frontier Policy.\n\nAs he was about to leave, he asked: “And where is the little girl, sir?”\n\nAnd I, thinking that Mini must get rid of her false fear, had her brought out.\n\nShe stood by my chair, and looked at the Cabuliwallah and his bag. He offered her nuts and raisins, but she would not be tempted, and only clung the closer to me, with all her doubts increased.\n\nThis was their first meeting. One morning, however, not many days later, as I was leaving the house, I was startled to find Mini, seated on a bench near the door, laughing and talking, with the great Cabuliwallah at her feet. In all her life, it appeared; my small daughter had never found so patient a listener, save her father. And already the corner of her little sari was stuffed with almonds and raisins, the gift of her visitor, “Why did you give her those?” I said, and taking out an eight-anna bit, I handed it to him. The man accepted the money without demur, and slipped it into his pocket.\n\nAlas, on my return an hour later, I found the unfortunate coin had made twice its own worth of trouble! For the Cabuliwallah had given it to Mini, and her mother catching sight of the bright round object, had pounced on the child with: “Where did you get that eight-anna bit? “\n\n“The Cabuliwallah gave it me,” said Mini cheerfully.\n\n“The Cabuliwallah gave it you!” cried her mother much shocked. “Oh, Mini! how could you take it from him?”\n\nI, entering at the moment, saved her from impending disaster, and proceeded to make my own inquiries.\n\nIt was not the first or second time, I found, that the two had met. The Cabuliwallah had overcome the child’s first terror by a judicious bribery of nuts and almonds, and the two were now great friends.\n\nThey had many quaint jokes, which afforded them much amusement. Seated in front of him, looking down on his gigantic frame in all her tiny dignity, Mini would ripple her face with laughter, and begin: “O Cabuliwallah, Cabuliwallah, what have you got in your bag?”\n\nAnd he would reply, in the nasal accents of the mountaineer: “An elephant!” Not much cause for merriment, perhaps; but how they both enjoyed the witticism! And for me, this child’s talk with a grown-up man had always in it something strangely fascinating.\n\nThen the Cabuliwallah, not to be behindhand, would take his turn: “Well, little one, and when are you going to the father-in-law’s house?”\n\nNow most small Bengali maidens have heard long ago about the father-in-law’s house; but we, being a little new-fangled, had kept these things from our child, and Mini at this question must have been a trifle bewildered. But she would not show it, and with ready tact replied: “Are you going there?”\n\nAmongst men of the Cabuliwallah class, however, it is well known that the words father-in-law’s house have a double meaning. It is a euphemism for jail, the place where we are well cared for, at no expense to ourselves. In this sense would the sturdy pedlar take my daughter’s question. “Ah,” he would say, shaking his fist at an invisible policeman, “I will thrash my father-in-law!” Hearing this, and picturing the poor discomfited relative, Mini would go off into peals of laughter, in which her formidable friend would join.\n\nThese were autumn mornings, the very time of year when kings of old went forth to conquest; and I, never stirring from my little corner in Calcutta, would let my mind wander over the whole world. At the very name of another country, my heart would go out to it, and at the sight of a foreigner in the streets, I would fall to weaving a network of dreams, –the mountains, the glens, and the forests of his distant home, with his cottage in its setting, and the free and independent life of far-away wilds.\n\nPerhaps the scenes of travel conjure themselves up before me, and pass and repass in my imagination all the more vividly, because I lead such a vegetable existence, that a call to travel would fall upon me like a thunderbolt.\n\nIn the presence of this Cabuliwallah, I was immediately transported to the foot of arid mountain peaks, with narrow little defiles twisting in and out amongst their towering heights. I could see the string of camels bearing the merchandise, and the company of turbaned merchants, carrying some of their queer old firearms, and some of their spears, journeying downward towards the plains. I could see–but at some such point Mini’s mother would intervene, imploring me to “beware of that man.”\n\nMini’s mother is unfortunately a very timid lady. Whenever she hears a noise in the street, or sees people coming towards the house, she always jumps to the conclusion that they are either thieves, or drunkards, or snakes, or tigers, or malaria or cockroaches, or caterpillars, or an English sailor. Even after all these years of experience, she is not able to overcome her terror. So she was full of doubts about the Cabuliwallah, and used to beg me to keep a watchful eye on him.\n\nI tried to laugh her fear gently away, but then she would turn round on me seriously, and ask me solemn questions.\n\nWere children never kidnapped?\n\nWas it, then, not true that there was slavery in Kabul?\n\nWas it so very absurd that this big man should be able to carry off a tiny child?\n\nI urged that, though not impossible, it was highly improbable. But this was not enough, and her dread persisted. As it was indefinite, however, it did not seem right to forbid the man the house, and the intimacy went on unchecked.\n\nOnce a year in the middle of January Rahmun, the Cabuliwallah, was in the habit of returning to his country, and as the time approached he would be very busy, going from house to house collecting his debts. This year, however, he could always find time to come and see Mini. It would have seemed to an outsider that there was some conspiracy between the two, for when he could not come in the morning, he would appear in the evening.\n\nEven to me it was a little startling now and then, in the corner of a dark room, suddenly to surprise this tall, loose-garmented, much be bagged man; but when Mini would run in smiling, with her, “O! Cabuliwallah! Cabuliwallah!” and the two friends, so far apart in age, would subside into their old laughter and their old jokes, I felt reassured.\n\nOne morning, a few days before he had made up his mind to go, I was correcting my proof sheets in my study. It was chilly weather. Through the window the rays of the sun touched my feet, and the slight warmth was very welcome. It was almost eight o’clock, and the early pedestrians were returning home, with their heads covered. All at once, I heard an uproar in the street, and, looking out, saw Rahmun being led away bound between two policemen, and behind them a crowd of curious boys.\n\nThere were blood-stains on the clothes of the Cabuliwallah, and one of the policemen carried a knife. Hurrying out, I stopped them, and enquired what it all meant. Partly from one, partly from another, I gathered that a certain neighbour had owed the pedlar something for a Rampuri shawl, but had falsely denied having bought it, and that in the course of the quarrel, Rahmun had struck him.\n\nNow in the heat of his excitement, the prisoner began calling his enemy all sorts of names, when suddenly in a verandah of my house appeared my little Mini, with her usual exclamation: “O Cabuliwallah! Cabuliwallah!” Rahmun’s face lighted up as he turned to her. He had no bag under his arm today, so she could not discuss the elephant with him.\n\nShe at once therefore proceeded to the next question: “Are you going to the father-in-law’s house?” Rahmun laughed and said: “Just where I am going, little one!” Then seeing that the reply did not amuse the child, he held up his fettered hands. ” Ali,” he said, ” I would have thrashed that old father-in-law, but my hands are bound!”\n\nOn a charge of murderous assault, Rahmun was sentenced to some years’ imprisonment.\n\nTime passed away, and he was not remembered. The accustomed work in the accustomed place was ours, and the thought of the once-free mountaineer spending his years in prison seldom or never occurred to us. Even my light-hearted Mini, I am ashamed to say, forgot her old friend. New companions filled her life. As she grew older, she spent more of her time with girls. So much time indeed did she spend with them that she came no more, as she used to do, to her father’s room. I was scarcely on speaking terms with her.\n\nYears had passed away. It was once more autumn and we had made arrangements for our Mini’s marriage. It was to take place during the Puja Holidays. With Durga returning to Kailas, the light of our home also was to depart to her husband’s house, and leave her father’s in the shadow.\n\nThe morning was bright. After the rains, there was a sense of ablution in the air, and the sun-rays looked like pure gold. So bright were they that they gave a beautiful radiance even to the sordid brick walls of our Calcutta lanes. Since early dawn to-day the wedding-pipes had been sounding, and at each beat my own heart throbbed. The wail of the tune, Bhairavi, seemed to intensify my pain at the approaching separation. My Mini was to be married to-night.\n\nFrom early morning noise and bustle had pervaded the house. In the courtyard the canopy had to be slung on its bamboo poles; the chandeliers with their tinkling sound must be hung in each room and verandah. There was no end of hurry and excitement. I was sitting in my study, looking through the accounts, when someone entered, saluting respectfully, and stood before me. It was Rahmun the Cabuliwallah. At first I did not recognise him. He had no bag, nor the long hair, nor the same vigour that he used to have. But he smiled, and I knew him again.\n\n“When did you come, Rahmun?” I asked him.\n\n“Last evening,” he said, “I was released from jail.”\n\nThe words struck harsh upon my ears. I had never before talked with one who had wounded his fellow, and my heart shrank within itself, when I realised this, for I felt that the day would have been better-omened had he not turned up.\n\n“There are ceremonies going on,” I said, “and I am busy. Could you perhaps come another day?”\n\nAt once he turned to go; but as he reached the door he hesitated, and said: “May I not see the little one, sir, for a moment?” It was his belief that Mini was still the same. He had pictured her running to him as she used, calling “O Cabuliwallah! Cabuliwallah!” He had imagined too that they would laugh and talk together, just as of old. In fact, in memory of former days he had brought, carefully wrapped up in paper, a few almonds and raisins and grapes, obtained somehow from a countryman, for his own little fund was dispersed.\n\nI said again: “There is a ceremony in the house, and you will not be able to see anyone to-day.”\n\nThe man’s face fell. He looked wistfully at me for a moment, said “Good morning,” and went out. I felt a little sorry, and would have called him back, but I found he was returning of his own accord. He came close up to me holding out his offerings and said: “I brought these few things, sir, for the little one. Will you give them to her?”\n\nI took them and was going to pay him, but he caught my hand and said: “You are very kind, sir! Keep me in your recollection. Do not offer me money!–You have a little girl, I too have one like her in my own home. I think of her, and bring fruits to your child, not to make a profit for myself.”\n\nSaying this, he put his hand inside his big loose robe, and brought out a small and dirty piece of paper. With great care he unfolded this, and smoothed it out with both hands on my table. It bore the impression of a little band. Not a photograph. Not a drawing. The impression of an ink-smeared hand laid flat on the paper. This touch of his own little daughter had been always on his heart, as he had come year after year to Calcutta, to sell his wares in the streets.\n\nTears came to my eyes. I forgot that he was a poor Cabuli fruit-seller, while I was–but no, what was I more than he? He also was a father. That impression of the hand of his little Parbati in her distant mountain home reminded me of my own little Mini.\n\nThat impression of the hand of his little Parbati in her distant mountain home reminded me of my own little Mini.\n\nI sent for Mini immediately from the inner apartment. Many difficulties were raised, but I would not listen. Clad in the red silk of her wedding-day, with the sandal paste on her forehead, and adorned as a young bride, Mini came, and stood bashfully before me.\n\nThe Cabuliwallah looked a little staggered at the apparition. He could not revive their old friendship. At last he smiled and said: “Little one, are you going to your father-in-law’s house?”\n\nAt last he smiled and said: “Little one, are you going to your father-in-law’s house?”\n\nBut Mini now understood the meaning of the word “father-in-law,” and she\n\ncould not reply to him as of old. She flushed up at the question, and stood before him with her bride-like face turned down.\n\nI remembered the day when the Cabuliwallah and my Mini had first met, and I felt sad. When she had gone, Rahmun heaved a deep sigh, and sat down on the floor. The idea had suddenly come to him that his daughter too must have grown in this long time, and that he would have to make friends with her anew. Assuredly he would not find her, as he used to know her. And besides, what might not have happened to her in these eight years?\n\nThe marriage-pipes sounded, and the mild autumn sun streamed round us. But Rahmun sat in the little Calcutta lane, and saw before him the barren mountains of Afghanistan.\n\nI took out a bank-note, and gave it to him, saying: “Go back to your own daughter, Rahmun, in your own country, and may the happiness of your meeting bring good fortune to my child!”\n\nHaving made this present, I had to curtail some of the festivities. I could not have the electric lights I had intended, nor the military band, and the ladies of the house were despondent at it. But to me the wedding feast was all the brighter for the thought that in a distant land a long-lost father met again with his only child."

      "body": "Abby From Underland:\n\nThe Royal Cook ordered Abby to bring a goblet of foaming starcider to the prince. She knocked, waited, and opened the door, but he didn’t stir from where he sat absorbed in a book. From the look of the volumes that lined the looming shelves, this was a learned prince.\n\nShe widened her eyes until they glowed to study the boy, a twelve-year-old like Abby. Lost in wonder, she spilled the goblet of amber liquid, which fanned across the floor.\n\nThe prince, with his blond brows creased and his blue eyes piercing, pivoted on the throne-like chair. “What’s this?” The purplish gem on his forehead cast a circle of light around the chamber.\n\nAbby spills the starciderAbby jumped back and trembled. “I . . . uh . . . !” She shook her head of coppery hair, unable to speak. What’s the use in defending myself? she thought. I’m a hated stranger in his Gemfolk realm. Would the prince call the guard stationed outside to haul her off to prison? It was possible.\n\nDuring the last dismal month Abby had lived in the castle. She’d wandered off from a class trip above Underland and had been captured by a Gemguard. The guard called her a spy and dragged her to Gemland. Abby was cleared of the charge, but she couldn’t find her way back home. She became a scullery maid and the castle steward barked about her constant lateness. She slipped and slid across the pearly floors and couldn’t seem to get to any one place—the kitchen, the banquet hall, or the royal chambers—on time. Even the other servants snubbed her as an outcast foreigner.\n\nPrince Nathan just laughed and helped Abby mop up the spill. Then he motioned for her to take the plush chair beside his desk.\n\n“Thank you . . . your high . . . ness,” Abby stammered in dumbfounded surprise. She climbed onto the chair, designed for tall Gemfolk, not a girl of her petite stature.\n\n“I ask those I wish to know better to call me Nate.” The gem, no bigger than a coin, spread a halo of purple across his smiling face.\n\n“Well, call me Abby.” She returned Nate’s warm smile and squinted at the strange gem joined onto the skin on his forehead. It appeared delicate with its curved facets, still she shielded her eyes from the strength of its beam.\n\nNate shrugged. “My gem brightens when I feel . . .” He trailed off as a shy blush colored his cheeks.\n\n“What do you feel?” Abby ventured to ask.\n\n“Glad to know you, Abby from Underland!” Nate gripped her hand with a throbbing shake. “I’ve never met an actual Underlander.” He soared up to the topmost shelf, hefted a weighty text, and landed beside his desk.  “Your people should be praised, not scorned,” he said in a matter-of-fact-voice.\n\nAbby’s heart soared like the winged creatures of Mish, a remote region of dizzying heights. Had she—along with her misunderstood people—found had a royal ally in this prince?\n\nNate flipped the pages of the book, ran his finger down a passage, and read out loud: “‘Underlanders, known for their mysterious dreams are a race of cave dwellers. Whilst the Ancients once honored Underland, suspicion of their dream magic drove them deeper into the underground.’”\n\n“This is something of a joke among us.” Abby leaned over the chair to tap the page. “My people live inside houses my ancestors built into our caves. This myth kept us hidden until we grew apart from the upper world. After many moons, our white eyes glowed in the lightless mazes of our underground home.” Her head dropped to her chest. “Now the rest of the planet despises our dream visions as a kind of dark magic.”\n\n“It’s high time then.” Nate rubbed his chin as he watched Abby with a thoughtful look. “The world must embrace Underland again.”\n\nAbby stared out the window and sighed. The spires of Gemland Castle, unlike the softness of her earthy home, clawed the sky like fingernails of glass. She expected nothing in this hostile place where, worst of all, she’d lost the power of her dreams in the light-filled realm. How else could she find her way home?\n\n“Good prince, it’s enough that you embrace my people,” she murmured.\n\n“That I do, Abby!” Nate thumped her back and she lurched forward on the seat. “And I honor the gift of your magical dreams.”\n\nAbby could no longer claim that gift, but Nate’s merry laugh lifted her spirits.\n\nTension gripped Abby like a squeezing fist as they waited in the throne room. She’d agreed to meet the king and queen, but this had been Nate’s idea. Although Abby longed speak up for her people, she fought an eerie unease. She pondered Nate’s description of his parents as traditional folks who followed the old Gemland ways. Had their traditions prejudiced them against Underland?\n\nAbby peered from where she hid behind Nate at the glistening thrones across the room. Behind the thrones, a high window stretched to the dome of a vaulted ceiling. A serpentine tunnel wound its way down to an oval courtyard below the window. The tunnel spiraled from the throne room to the top of the castle, the highest spire in the land.\n\nAbby drew a deep breath as she felt herself shrink within the palatial room. Lights speckled the floor in a myriad of dotted rainbows. The forest where she’d emerged from Underland what seemed like ages before looked faraway through the window. Abby’s parents must have tried to find her, but how could they have crossed the guarded border? They might wind up being captured by Gemguards, too.\n\nAbby wagged her head at the window in sorrow. She’d snuck off from her class to pick flowers for her sister’s birthday and, dazzled in the sunlit field, had been seized. Ever since, she pined for her family, her friends, and her cozy room at home. To top it off, she felt even more lost without the guiding visions of her dreams.\n\nTwo uniformed guards ducked under the tunnel’s mouth and flew to stand beside the thrones. One blew a gleaming trumpet and thundered, “All hail, King Reginald and Queen Monica!”\n\nThe gemstones on the guards’ and Nate’s foreheads lit with the sweep of their bows. Abby, bowing beside Nate, ground her teeth at the thought of what her people viewed as servile homage. For the sake of Nate’s friendship, she bore the indignity.\n\nIn a swirl of iridescent, white robes, the king and queen swooped out of the tunnel and settled onto their thrones. Like their son, they were fair-skinned, golden-haired, and tall. Unlike their friendly son, frowns sharpened their drawn faces.\n\n“Why have you troubled us, Prince Nathan?” King Reginald’s question rang out. “We were about to embark on a Royal Hunt.”\n\nNate had told Abby how his parents spent most of their time engaged in hunts and lavish banquets.\n\n“Father, Mother,” Nate met their eyes, piercing blue like his, “I would not have asked for this audience without just cause.” He patted Abby’s hand. “I’ve made a trustworthy friend in Abigail from Underland. I pray you hear us out—”\n\n“How can you disgrace us like this?” The queen’s gem sparked with pink lights as she clutched her face in her hands. “You were warned of the dark magic of her people!”\n\n“Prince Nathan, you will not attempt to see this vile foreigner again,” the king snarled at Nate and fixed a glare on Abby. “We rescued you from your dingy Underland to dwell in our glorious kingdom and you poison our son’s mind! Is this how you redeem the name of your roguish people in our eyes?”\n\nThe scorn she’d put up with for six homesick months formed on Abby’s tongue. She raised her eyes to boldly meet the king’s glare and cried out, “Your son alone redeemed your people in my eyes!”\n\nA shocked silence followed the pulsing echo of Abby’s words. Even Nate nudged her side, but Abby, who’d heard enough—too many—insults, didn’t care.\n\nThe queen slapped the armrest of her throne and demanded her guard to, “Remove this insolent girl from our presence!”\n\n“Guards, seize the Underlander!” the king ordered.\n\n“No, Mother, Father, please!” Nate clasped his hands in a pleading gesture. “Abby, I’m so sorry–!”\n\nThe queen’s guard rushed over and thrust out his arm to hold Nate, who flailed his arms.\n\n“Let him be!” Abby lunged to defend her friend.\n\nThe king’s burly guard lumbered toward Abby and barked, “Hold your tongue, girl.” He dragged her out of the door, which slammed with a deafening clang. He rose in the air and carried Abby in flight down a twisty corridor.\n\nNate’s loud protests rang out in the hallway as Abby’s mind whirled. Will I ever see the prince, my only friend in Gemland, again?\n\nThe guard’s coarse fingers dug into her arms until they landed before a padlocked door. “See to our guest’s accommodations.” He jerked his beard at a scruffy gray-haired warden who unlatched the door.\n\nThe guard lifted Abby by the neckline of her tunic and dropped her on the dungeon floor. The door shut with a thud and the guard’s and warden’s boot-steps faded outside. Abby widened her eyes until they glowed with white to scan the musty dungeon. Its cracked stones sloped in a ceiling, which was laced with straggled moss. “Just like,” she sputtered with anger, “but not my home!”\n\nA solitary tear coursed down Abby’s cheek. How could she survive imprisonment to return her beloved homeland? She wept into her palms, clamped shut her eyes, and, drained by the struggle, lapsed into slumber.\n\nA vision wove its way into her dream. Nate’s smiling face, lit by the circular glow of his gem, greeted her within the dream. He lifted a finger toward a forest path and Abby took it as a sign of hope. Hadn’t Nate reminded her? She was descended from a race of gifted people. Abby’s path became clear through the seeing magic of her dream. Somehow she would escape to return to her people.\n\nFirst she needed to garner her strength, which for any Underlander stemmed from sleep.\n\nThe door opened with a noisy squeak that woke Abby whose temper surged. “What now?” To awaken a dreaming Underlander was the height of insult.\n\n“You, cave dweller, a castle soldier’s come to take you to court.” The warden jerked a bony thumb behind him. “You’d better not make him wait!”\n\nAbby, too groggy to argue, stood on wobbly legs to follow him out of the dungeon. The mustached soldier thrust her head first through a back door. She dropped, her limbs splayed, onto the cobblestones of a grimy alleyway.\n\n“Yow!” Abby rubbed her stinging chin.\n\nThe moment the warden slammed the door, the soldier bent over Abby. “Forgive my bad manners, Miss Abigail, but your escape must appear believable,” he explained in a hushed voice.\n\n“Huh?” Abby, baffled by his sudden kindness, squinted from where she sprawled on the ground.\n\n“There’s not much time before sunrise. Quick, grab hold of my feet,” he instructed.\n\nHer jumbled thoughts raced as Abby crawled further down the alleyway. The soldier moved toward her and she sidled against a gap in the stone wall. Its opening, big enough for Abby to slip into, was too narrow for the towering soldier.\n\nJust then, her dream-vision flashed to mind. Maybe this wasn’t another prejudiced Gemfolk who had come to seize her. Abby sensed that she needed to trust the mysterious soldier. She sucked in a deep breath, struggled to her feet, and took a step toward him.\n\nShe knelt to clutch the soldier’s boots and his golden buttons jangled as they flew above the pavement. He maneuvered the dusky maze of alleys and Abby’s bare feet slapped the corners of buildings. She bit her lip to keep from yelping.\n\nThey came to a foggy road and soared over it to the kingdom’s border. Then they alighted on the shadowy edge of the forest. Abby spied a shrouded figure lurking between the trees and gasped. Had she misunderstod her dream-vision? Did the soldier lead me into a trap?\n\nShe backed up, ready to scamper into the forest when the hood fell back to unveil Nate’s smiling face. Abby flung her arms around the prince.\n\n“I hope you haven’t suffered, my friend.” Nate’s forehead creased with a look of concern.\n\n“Not much, Nate.” Abby shook his upturned hand. “It took imprisonment in that dark, lightless dungeon to divine the magic of my dreams.”\n\n“We must make haste now.” Nate patted her shoulder. “The castle guards will seek you out come morning.” He turned to the soldier. “I shall not forget this kindness, captain.”\n\nThe light of their gems mingled as Nate returned the soldier’s bow.\n\n“Prince Nathan, you will be a great king to usher in a bright future for our kingdom. You are by no means alone in your belief that our world must evolve to embrace all peoples,” the soldier said with a brisk nod in Abby’s direction.\n\nNate watched Abby as he answered, “One day our lands of light and darkness will be united.”\n\nAnd maybe Abby’s lost sojourn had been in a worthy cause. Nate, the future king of Gemland, would honor her people and the good magic of their dreams.\n\nNate drew a yellowed map from the pocket of his purple cloak. “Now, Abby of Underland, let the beacons of your glowing eyes and my gem’s light guide our steps.” He turned and, just like in Abby’s dream, pointed to a path that meandered into the forest. “I’ll help you find your way home.”\n\nAbby, whose eyes cast a vivid glow into the forest, skipped with joy onto the path. Nate trailed her, laughing out loud.\n\n“Aah, Prince,” she spun around to exclaim, “your laughter is a delightful stream trickling through a happy garden!”\n\nThat happy garden was Abby’s heart, which thumped with joy. She was going home."

All that was holding them back from escaping the camp, was a small piece of rope tied to one of their legs.\n\nAs the man gazed upon the elephants, he was completely confused as to why the elephants didn’t just use their strength to break the rope and escape the camp. They could easily have done so, but instead they didn’t try to at all.\n\nCurious and wanting to know the answer, he asked a trainer nearby why the elephants were just standing there and never tried to escape.\n\nThe trainer replied;\n\n“when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”\n\nThe only reason that the elephants weren’t breaking free and escaping from the camp was because over time they adopted the belief that it just wasn’t possible.\n\nMoral of the story: No matter how much the world tries to hold you back, always continue with the belief that what you want to achieve is possible. Believing you can become successful is the most important step in actually achieving it."

Another huge door opened and they came into alaboratory that was a full of whiling lights and colorful fluids boiling and percolating allover the place. Suddenly from behind a work station a wild haired silly looking manappeared. He was tall, lanky, his glasses were taped in the middle and his hair wenteverywhere.\n\n“Brad, Janet, I am so glad you are here for this important night. I am Doctor Stein.Frank Stein but call me Doctor Stein. You met Igor.” The crazy man said talking fastwith his hands and arms going everywhere as he talked.\n\n“I thought his name was Gregor.” Brad objected.\n\n“Gregor, Igor, what’s the difference?” Said the doctor. “What’s important is what I havehere. Look in these bottles. In these bottles I have the final two formulas for bottling themost important need mankind has ever had. Yes, I have perfected the formula to bottlelove. Think of it Brad. You too Janet. If I can bottle love, nobody will be unloved everagain. They can just drink my formula and, whammo, instant love.”\n\n“But that doesn’t really make sense because…..” Janet started to say but she couldn’tinterrupt.\n\n“THIS IS PERFECT.” The doctor yelled throwing his arms all around him. “Theformulas are at their perfect moment right now. We have to get an experiment done.Now, formula number one, its ready. Igor come here, drink this.” And he handed hisbent over servant the vial with some of the fluid that was supposed to be love. Igor drankit, then he began to twitch and make weird noises.\n\n“EEK, IKE, OOPS, YOWZA!” Igor said and then je fell to the ground. He didn’t exactlystand back up but got up on his hands and knees. “Arf.” He barked. “Arf arf” and hebegan panting and acting exactly like a dog.”\n\n“Oh my.” Janet said quietly.\n\n“You said a mouthful Janet.” Said Doctor Stein. “That’s all wrong. If you have love in abottle, it shouldn’t turn you into a dog. We need more love in the world, not more dogs.”And he went to the counter and got a shot. “Here Igor, this is the antidote.” He gave Igorthe shot. Igor rolled over to have his belly scratched then twitched.\n\n“EEK, IKE, OOPS, YOWZA!” he said and then he stood up. “Master can’t we use miceor somebody else for these experiments? I am getting worn out turning into things.”“You mean you have tried your love in a bottle on him before?” Brad said with outrage.\n\n“Well yes.” The doctor confessed. “Those experiments didn’t exactly work out. Thefirst time it changed him into a lemur. Let me see then there was the time he was a ferret,an entire band of circus acrobats and a stick.”\n\n“Don’t forget an eggplant, a girl scout, John Wayne, the entire cheerleading squad forGeorge Washington Carver Middle School and Elvis” Igor remembered painfully.“Yes some of the formulas have not gone very well.” Doctor Frank Stein said sadly.“But this time I think we got close. He was a dog and after all, everybody loves dogs.”\n\n“You can’t get love inside you drinking a medicine.” Janet finally said firmly gettingtired of all this foolishness.\n\n“What do you mean?” The mad scientist asked.\n\n“You can only get the love of God in you from Jesus?” She continued. “The Bible tellsyou all about it.” Janet said and she took out her Bible and showed Igor and Doctor Steinwhere Jesus taught his disciples that all of us have to accept Jesus as our savior and thatthen His love would fill our hearts to overflowing.\n\n“You mean God just pours love into your heart and you don’t have to drink anything?”Doctor Stein asked.\n\n“That’s right and you don’t have to buy anything or even be a good person because Jesuswill come in and make you a good person from the inside out.” Brad added rememberingall the good things Janet and he had learned in Sunday school.\n\n“Well there goes the plan to get rich selling love in a bottle.” The doctor said sadly.“But you can be full of His love right now. You too Igor. If you let us pray with you toaccept Jesus.” Brad continued.\n\nSo the doctor and Igor accepted Jesus and their hearts were full of God’s love for the restof their lives. God used their amazing talents for good things, to help poor people andcure diseases. And they never again made a formula that turned people in eggplants,ferrets or Elvis and none of their medicines made people go. “EEK, IKE, OOPS,YOWZA!”"

      "body": "The Good Talker:\n\nValue: Spiritual Gifts\n\n“Who needs him, he’s such a loser.” Roger responded to his friend Steven when thesubject of Danny came up.\n\n“That’s a pretty harsh thing to say about your brother.” Steven responded. Roger knew itwas harsh. He thought back when he and Danny were kids. Danny, the older by a yearand a half, was always the guy who could “fix anything”. Oh, how mom and dadbragged on Danny when he fixed the washing machine or the lawnmower of unclogged adrain in the kitchen. At first, Roger tried to learn to do what Danny did but it neverworked out.\n\nFinally, in high school, Roger found his gift and like his own dad, it was the gift of gab.He won competition after competition in speech, debate and other forms of speechgiving. He seemed to have a natural ability to talk to people, give speeches or just getpeople to see things his way or rally to his cause. It served him well as he moved into asales career whereas Danny built a very successful auto mechanics business around hisskill.\n\nBut sadly, for all the success the brothers had their dislike of each other kept them apart.Danny never understood by talking was a good skill and Roger thought being able totinker with machines or pipes or wires was a geeky way to be. They fought about itendlessly until Danny moved out but holidays were always tense except when they wentto see Grandma. Everything stopped at Grandma’s house because she saw them as hersweet baby boys and for a while when they visited her, they were sweet and childrenagain, innocent and always ready to play.\n\nSteven left his friend Roger in his office thinking about his brother. Roger wondered ifthere ever be a way to make things ok between them. He didn’t know that over I hisgarage, while fixing a car, Danny was wondering the same thing. Roger’s thoughts werebroken by the phone ringing. He answered it. The sound of urgency in the voice wasfrightening.\n\n“Roger, the floods have his Pilger.” Steven informed him. Pilger was not far from thelarge city where his family grew up. “The water is rising there and people are becomingtrapped in their second floors. The Red Cross is going in to try to get people out.”\n\nAt first, Roger didn’t get too alarmed but then he remembered, Pilger was whereGrandma lived. He picked up the phones and called her but no answer. He knew shelived alone in that big house and probably could not get to the phone. The thought of heralone facing that terror was more than he could stand. Moving almost on instinct, Rogergot moving. He organized a rescue mission for the town of Pilger using his huge networkof contacts at church, work, his clubs and his business contacts. Within hours, Roger hadan army of men and machinery gathered in the parking lot of the Church. They wereready to invade Pilger and save those people.\n\n“Folks,” he announced to the crowd of rescuers from his bullhorn. “We need to pray.My grandma is down there and you all have relatives there too. Let’s pray that God helpthem until we can get there.” And then he bowed his head and led them in prayer.\n\n“Roger we have another area to pray about.” Steve shouted out. “Lots of these boats arebroken. We need mechanical help or getting all of us down there will be no good. Weneed someone who can fix anything.” Roger felt his face go hot with emotion because itwas like God was telling him, “Get Danny.” He had no time to wallow in self-pity orresentment at Danny. He picked up his cell phone and called his brother’s number.\n\nAll he had to say to Danny was “Danny, its Roger, grandma’s in danger. Get downhere.” And he knew Danny would fly to the scene. And that is what happened. Dannybrought his tools and workers and in no time, they had the machines in tiptop shape. Sideby side, the brothers loaded the boats and together they got to Pilger and got every citizenout. As the brothers sat side by side on the boat heading to grandma’s house they bothsuddenly knew why they were so different. Danny knew that he could have never gottensuch a huge response and organized the rescue so beautifully. And Roger knew thatDanny’s gift for fixing things was crucial to their success.\n\nAs they got grandma into the boat, she hugged them both and kissed them and then shesaid what they both were thinking. “God has given each of you boys a wonderfulspiritual gift. Working together you are a powerful tool for him.” They knew it was rightbecause that is how God blesses the church. By giving everyone unique and wonderfulgifts, we all can work together to do what God has for us to do. Separate we areincomplete but together we are powerful tools for God to use for good."

They talked about so many things and various subjects. suddenly, they touched the subject of God.\n\nThe barber said: “Look man, I don’t believe that God exists as you say so.”\n\nWhy do you say that?” asked the client.\n\nWell, it’s so easy, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God does not exist. Oh, tell me, if God existed, would there be so many sick people? Would there be abandoned children? If God existed, there would be no suffering nor pain. I can’t think of a God who permits all of these things.”\n\nThe client stopped for a moment thinking but he didn’t want to respond so as to prevent an argument. The barber finished his job and the client went out of the shop. Just after he left the barber shop he saw a man in the street with a long hair and beard (it seems that it had been a long time since he had his cut and he looked so untidy).\n\nThen the client again entered the barber shop and he said to the barber: “Know what? Barbers do not exist.”\n\n“How come they don’t exist?”-asked the barber. “Well I am here and I am a barber.”\n\n“No!” – the client exclaimed. “They don’t exist because if they did there would be no people with long hair and beard like that man who walks in the street.”\n\n“Ah, barbers do exist, what happens is that people do not come to me.”\n\n“Exactly!”- affirmed the client. “That’s the point. GOD does exist, what happens is people don’t go to Him and do not look for Him that’s why there’s so much pain and suffering in the world.”\n\nWhat about you? Do you believe that God exists?"

Each night the soldiers would return to their barracks, some wounded, some disillusioned and some vengeful. Others were dead and never did return.\n\nOne such night, a wounded soldier, knocked at a lonesome cottage in the sinister darkness. An old woman opened the door. Without any questions,hesitations or semblance of fear she let the young fellow in. He said brusquely, “I have a bullet in my arm. I need help.” She said,”Look son, I am all alone here. My son too is in the army, but he is not here. I’ll do whatever I can to help you. Sit down by the log fire and make yourself warm. She brought him some hot tea and a few slices of bread. “Eat,” she said simply.\n\nThe young man sipped the tea, looking around uneasily. He wasn’t even sure,if he was in his own territory. Should he ask the old woman? If it was enemy territory, she would surely find a way to kill him! Poison him perhaps! He was totally helpless. He had lost a lot of blood.\n\nThe old lady said, “Shall I help you to take that shirt off, maybe I could look at the wound.” The young soldier winced and said, “Nothing you can do; let it be.” But he knew that he needed help and soon.\n\nThe young soldier winced and said, “Nothing you can do; let it be.” But he knew that he needed help and soon.\n\nAn hour later there was another knock at the door. Another young soldier walked in,”Mama!” he called. “Oh! It’s you my son. It’s been so many days. I’m so happy to have you home.” The son saw the other soldier and said,”Mama! Who is that?” She replied, “Ssh! He’s just slept. Be careful, lest you wake him up.” The boy said tersely, “He’s the enemy Mama! You put us all into danger by letting him in.” The mother said, “But, he’s wounded badly. Look son, enemy or not, you have to help him.”\n\nThe boy spoke some angry words but she stuck to her stand. The heated exchange of words woke up the soldier. In an instant he saw the new entrant and realized that he was at the mercy of the enemy.\n\nIn an instant he saw the new entrant and realized that he was at the mercy of the enemy.\n\nThe woman said, “This is my son, I’m sure together we can do something for you.”The old woman motioned to her son and together they unbuttoned the stranger’s torn shirt. Against his wishes, the son, upon his mother’s insistence, dug out the bullet amidst a continuous flow of blood. He cleaned it up, applied some ointment and bandaged it. “That’s the best I can do. You need to see a doctor.” “I’ll be on my way now,”said the soldier, making an attempt to get up, but not succeeding.\n\nThe old woman said firmly,”No way. You’re not going anywhere. In the morning, you may go if you wish to. But right now, you are under my care. Sleep now!” In the morning after eating a wholesome breakfast of hot porridge, the soldier said to the old woman, “How can I ever thank you?” She replied,”By Killing the enmity; not the enemy.”\n\nThe soldier was unnerved. He didn’t know what to say. Finally he said,”I’ll try my best,” he extended his hand towards the son, but instantaneously changed the handshake into an embrace. The soldier said, “We all need someone like your mother, to tell us that it’s the enmity that has to be killed, not the enemy. The ‘enemy’ is also made of flesh and blood like us and some of them have hearts of gold. I promise to try my best. I hope you will too.”\n\nThe soldier left, but that night he understood the meaning of the term ‘brotherhood of man.’ He knew that only one weapon was needed to kill all enmities. And that weapon was LOVE."

Little Johannes sat on the hill watching the tinybarn in the valley where they say the miracle baby was just born. But instead of hisparents, a small boy came out carrying a drum and made his way up the hill.\n\n“Oh hello.” The little drummer boy said when he saw the young shepherd boy. “I amAmahl.”\n\n“I am Johannes.” The shepherd introduced himself. “Have you been to see the Christchild?”\n\n“Yes, I traveled here with the wise men from the east. I could not afford a gift so they letme play my drum for him. I will never forget it.” Amahl told his new friend sitting nextto him in the snow.\n\n“Yes, I want to see the messiah so much. It is the greatest miracle to come to our peoplesince the Hanukah miracle.” Johannes reflected.\n\n“I am not part of your proud Hebrew tradition.” Amahl confessed. “What is this story ofHanukah?”\n\nSo Amahl began to draw pictures in the snow to tell the story. “A long time ago, overhundred and fifty years ago to be exact, the Hebrew people were being treated verycruelly by bad men who were the government. They did not respect our religion and theydestroyed our temple and put filthy things that made our temple unholy on our alters andkilled many many people”\n\n“Oh that must have been terrible.” Amahl observed. “Stories are told of this horribletreatment around the world. The wise men who brought me talked of them during thelong ride to Bethlehem. They said a great champion saved your people.”\n\n“Yes, that’s true. His name was Judas Maccabeus and God gave him great victories overour oppressors. He was able to defeat armies of ten thousand with just a few hundredsoldiers just like the great deliverers of history did. It was truly a show of how faithfuland protective God is of his people.” Johannes continued.\n\n“So you celebrate Hanukah because of the miracle of deliverance that God did throughJudas Maccabeus?” Wondered Amahl.\n\n“Well there’s more to the story.” Amahl continued happy to be able to tell the story ofthe Hanukah miracle. “Judas Maccabeas drove the oppressors from our land. Our priestsand valiant men took the temple back as the battle raged. In the temple there is a flamethat is to burn for eternity. It represents that God is present in the temple and He willnever leave us or forsake us. When our priests reentered the temple that day, they foundthe lamp still burning despite the horrible things the enemy had done to our holy places.It showed us for sure that God never left us and will never leave us, even when wesuffer.” Johannes said sound much like his father when the story is told each year in theirhome.\n\n“This is a wonderful God you have. I wish all the peoples of the world could come toHim.” Amahl said sadly.\n\n“The miracle of Hanukah shows that God will save his people no matter what. Thepriests found there was only enough oil for one day left for the lamp to continue to burn.Because they had to stay in the temple as the battle raged on, there was no way theycould go find oil for the lamp and yet that lamp was God’s presence with us. For eightdays they waited to get out to get more oil.” Amahl said whispering in awe.\n\n“And the lamp? Did God’s presence lift because the oil ran out?” Johannes askedeagerly.\n\n“NO!” Amahl said triumphantly, “The lamp burned for eight days on one days worth ofoil. That is the miracle of Hanukah and why we celebrate each year for eight days tocommemorate that God would not let his spirit lift from us even though supplies were notavailable to keep the lamp burning. Our God is not bound by missing oil or anything. Hehas the power to do miracles for all of his people. And now he has done the greatestmiracle, he has sent His only son, Jesus to save all people so we all can be his children.”\n\n“As we traveled.” Amahl said, “the wise men spoke of salvation for all people too. Isn’tyour God just the God of the Hebrews and didn’t Jesus just come to save the Jews just asJudas Maccabee saved the Jewish people from outsiders?’ He asked confused.\n\nAmahl face lit up because he suddenly understood why Hanukah and Christmas are aboutthe same thing. “The miracle of the Christ child is like Hanukah. Just as God declared inHanukah that his presence will always be with us, now even more is God coming to beour friend and savior because God himself has come, not just oil form him or blessing butGod himself has come to be with us forever. And the miracle is greater still because asthe angel choir sang, his salvation is for all people, the Jews, the wise men from the east,you Amahl, all people can receive the salvation from God.”\n\nBoth boys got goose bumps from the amazing thing they learned about God. And on thatvery first Christmas night, Jew and non Jew alike joined hands and accepted the gift oflife from Jesus just like you and your family have done and people in your communitywill continue to do as you tell them the story of the amazing miracle of God’s blessingsshown in Hanukah and in the coming of his son, our savior, Jesus Christ our Lord."

      "body": "Cinderella:\n\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her end coming, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said, “Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.” Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her.\n\nAnd the snow spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own: they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. “What does the good-for-nothing thing want in the parlor?” said they; and they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old frock to put on, and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen.\n\nThen she was forced to do hard work; to rise early, before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. She had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes, and they called her Cinderella.\n\nIt happened once that her father was going to the fair, and asked his wife’s daughters what he should bring to them. “Fine clothes,” said the first. “Pearls and diamonds,” said the second. “Now, child,” said he to his own daughter, “what will you have?” “The first sprig, dear father, that rubs against your hat on your way home,” said she. Then he bought for the two first the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a sprig of hazel brushed against him, so he broke it off and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to her mother’s grave and planted it there, and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree, and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.\n\nNow it happened that the king of the land held a feast which was to last three days, and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself; and Cinderella’s two sisters were asked to come. So they called Cinderella, and said, “Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.” Then she did as she was told, but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she would have liked to go to the dance too.\n\nAt last she begged her mother very hard to let her go, “You! Cinderella?” said she; “you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance—you want to go to the ball?” And when she kept on begging, to get rid of her, she said at last, “I will throw this basinful of peas into the ash heap, and if you have picked them all out in two hours’ time you shall go to the feast too.” Then she threw the peas into the ashes; but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out—\n\n“Hither, thither, through the sky, turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\n\nBlackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay, hither, thither, haste away!\n\nOne and all, come, help me quick! haste ye, haste ye—pick, pick, pick!”\n\nThen first came two white doves; and next two turtle-doves; and after them all the little birds under heaven came, and the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick, and picked out all the good grain and put it into a dish, and left the ashes. At the end of one hour the work was done, and all flew out again at the windows.\n\nThen she brought the dish to her mother. But the mother said, “No, no! indeed, you have no clothes and cannot dance; you shall not go.” And when Cinderella begged very hard to go, she said, “If you can in one hour’s time pick two of these dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.” So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes; but the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and called as before and all the birds came flying, and in half an hour’s time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Cinderella took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. But her mother said, “It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance; and you would only put us to shame,” and off she went with her two daughters to the feast.\n\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Cinderella went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out—\n\n“Shake, shake, hazel-tree, gold and silver over me!”\n\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes.\n\n The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her and no one else; and he never left her hand, but when anyone else came to ask her to dance, he said, “This lady is dancing with me.”\n\nThey danced till a late hour of the night, and then she wanted to go home; and the king’s son said, “I shall go and take care of you to your home,” for he wanted to see where the beautiful maid lived.\n\nBut she slipped away from him unawares, and ran off towards home, and the prince followed her; then she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door. So he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden who had been at the feast had hidden herself in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, Cinderella lay, as she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes; for she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and laid them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away; and had seated herself amid the ashes again in her little old frock.\n\nThe next day, when the feast was again held, and her father, mother and sisters were gone, Cinderella went to the hazel-tree, and all happened as the evening before.\n\nThe king’s son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand and danced with her; and, when any one asked her to dance, he said as before, “This lady is dancing with me.” When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son went with her, but she sprang away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house. In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree; and Cinderella jumped up into it without being seen. Then the king’s son waited till her father came home, and said to him, “The unknown lady has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.” The father ordered an axe to be brought, and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Cinderella in the ashes as usual; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little old frock.\n\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she went again into the garden, and said—\n\n“Shake, shake, hazel-tree, gold and silver over me!”\n\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former one, and slippers which were all of gold; and the king’s son danced with her alone, and when any one else asked her to dance, he said, “This lady is my partner.” Now when night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with her, but she managed to slip away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.\n\nSo the prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king, his father, and said, “I will take for my wife the lady that this golden shoe fits.”\n\nThen both the sisters were overjoyed to hear this; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her big toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother said, “Never mind, cut it off. When you are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to go on foot.” So the silly girl cut her big toe off, and squeezed the shoe on, and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and rode away with her.\n\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Cinderella had planted, and there sat a little dove on the branch, singing—\n\n“Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\n\nThe shoe is too small, and not made for you!\n\nPrince! prince! look again for your bride,\n\nFor she’s not the true one that sits by your side.”\n\nThen the prince looked at her foot, and saw by the blood that streamed from it what a trick she had played him. So he brought the false bride back to her home, and said, “This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.” Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son; and he rode away with her. But when they came to the hazel-tree, the little dove sat there still, and sang as before. Then the king’s son looked down, and saw that the blood streamed from the shoe. So he brought her back again also. “This is not the true bride,” said he to the father; “have you no other daughters?”\n\nThen Cinderella came and she took her clumsy shoe off, and put on the golden slipper, and it fitted as if it had been made for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face the prince knew her, and said, “This is the right bride.”\n\nThen he took Cinderella on his horse and rode away. And when they came to the hazel-tree the white dove sang—“Prince! prince! take home your bride,\n\nFor she is the true one that sits by your side!”"

      "body": "Fisherman’s Life Log:\n\nOne day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.\n\nAbout that time, a businessman came walking down the beach trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family.\n\n“You aren’t going to catch many fish that way,” said the businessman to the fisherman, “you should be working rather than lying on the beach!” The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, “And what will my reward be?”\n\n“Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!” was the businessman’s answer. “And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman, still smiling.\n\n“And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman, still smiling.\n\nThe businessman replied, “You will make money and you’ll be able to buy a boat which will then result in larger catches of fish!”\n\n“And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman again.\n\nThe businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman’s questions. “You can buy a bigger boat and hire some people to work for you!” he said. “And then what will my reward be?” repeated the fisherman.\n\n“And then what will my reward be?” repeated the fisherman.\n\nThe businessman was getting angry. “Don’t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!” Once again the fisherman asked, “And then what will my reward be?”\n\nThe businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, “Don’t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach looking at the sunset. You won’t have a care in the world!”\n\nThe fisherman, still smiling, simply looked up, nodded and said: “And what do you think I am doing now?” He then looked at the sunset, with his pole in the water, without a care in the world.\n\nHowever, both the fisherman and the businessman were wrong in their materialistic outlook. We don’t have to work hard so that we become rich, sit in the beach and have no care in the world. Story teaches us to work hard to serve our family and our community and earn the pleasure of God, regardless of whether we are poor or rich."

      "body": "Bearskin:\n\nThere was once upon a time a young fellow who enlisted for a soldier, and became so brave and courageous that he was always in the front ranks when there was danger. As long as the war lasted all went well, but when peace was concluded he received his release, and the captain told him he might go where he liked.\nHis parents meanwhile had died, and as he had no longer any home to go to he paid a visit to his brothers, and asked them to give him shelter until war broke out again. His brothers, however, were hard-hearted, and said, “What could we do with you? We could make nothing of you; see to what you have brought yourself”; and so turned a deaf ear.\n\nThe poor Soldier had nothing but his rifle left; so he put this on his shoulder and set out on a journey. By and by he came to a great heath with nothing on it but a circle of trees, under which he sat down, sorrowfully considering his fate. “I have no money,” thought he; “I don’t know how to do anything but be a soldier and now, since there is peace, there is no need of me. I see well enough I shall have to starve.”\n\nAll at once he heard a rustling, and as he looked round he perceived a stranger standing before him, dressed in a gray coat, who looked very stately, but had an ugly cloven foot, being a foot split in two parts.\n\n“I know quite well what you need,” said this being; “gold and other possessions you shall have, as much as you can spend; but first I must know whether you are a coward or not, that I may not spend my money foolishly.”\n\n“A soldier and a coward!” replied the other, “that cannot be; you may put me to any proof.”\n\n“Well, then,” replied the stranger, “look behind you.”\n\nThe Soldier turned and saw a huge bear, which charged towards him in attack. “Oho!” cried he, “I will tickle your nose for you, that you shall no longer be able to grumble”; and, raising his rifle, he shot the bear in the forehead, so that he tumbled in a heap upon the ground, and did not stir. The stranger said, “I see quite well that you have courage; but there is yet one condition which you must fulfil.” “If it does not interfere with my future happiness,” said the Soldier, who had remarked who it was that addressed him; “if it does not interfere with that, I shall not hesitate.”\n\n“That you must see about yourself!” said the stranger. “For the next seven years you must not wash yourself, nor comb your hair or beard, neither must you cut your nails nor say one prayer. Then I will give you this coat and vest, which you must wear during these seven years; and if you die within that time you are mine, but if you live you are rich, and free all your life long.”\n\nThe Soldier thought for a while, and, remembering how often he had braved death, he at length agreed to accept the offer. Thereupon the Evil One pulled off the gray coat, handed it to the soldier, and said, “If you at any time search in the pockets of your coat when you have it on, you will always find your hand full of money.” Then also he pulled off the skin of the bear, and said, “That shall be your cloak and your bed; you must sleep on it, and not dare to lie in any other bed, and on this account you shall be called ‘Bearskin.'” Immediately the Evil One disappeared.\n\nThe Soldier now put on the coat, and dipped his hands into the pockets, to assure himself of the reality of the transaction. Then he hung the bearskin around himself, and went about the world chuckling at his good luck, and buying whatever suited his fancy which money could purchase. For the first year his appearance was not very remarkable, but in the second he began to look quite a monster. His hair covered almost all his face, his beard appeared like a piece of dirty cloth, his nails were claws, and he was covered with dirt that you could have planted seeds in.\n\nWhoever looked at him ran away; but because he gave the poor in every place gold coins, they prayed that he might not die during the seven years; and because he paid well everywhere, he found a night’s lodging without difficulty. In the fourth year he came to an inn where the landlord would not take him in, and refused even to give him a place in his stables, in case the horses should be frightened and become jumpy. However, when Bearskin put his hand into his pocket and drew it out full of gold ducats the landlord agreed and gave him a place in the outbuildings, but not till he had promised that he would not show himself, for fear the inn should get a bad name.\n\nWhile Bearskin sat by himself in the evening, wishing from his heart that the seven years were over, he heard in the corner a loud groan. Now the old Soldier had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door and saw an old man weeping violently and wringing his hands. Bearskin stepped nearer, but the old man jumped up and tried to escape; but when he recognized a human voice he let himself be persuaded, and by kind words and soothings on the part of the old Soldier he at length disclosed the cause of his distress. His property had dwindled away by degrees, and he and his daughters would have to starve, for he was so poor that he had not the money to pay the landlord, and would therefore be put into prison.\n\n“If you have no care except that,” replied Bearskin, “I have money enough”; and causing the landlord to be called, he paid him, and put a purse full of gold besides into the pocket of the old man. The old man, when he saw himself released from his troubles, was very grateful and said to the Soldier, “Come with me; my daughters are all wonders of beauty, so choose one of them for a wife. When they hear what you have done for me they will not refuse you. You appear certainly an unusual man, but they will soon put you to rights.”\n\nThis speech pleased Bearskin, and he went with the old man. As soon as the eldest daughter saw him, she was so terrified at his appearance that she screamed and ran away. The second one stopped and looked at him from head to foot; but at last she said, “How can I take a husband who has not a bit of a human appearance?\n\nBut the youngest daughter said, “Dear father, this must be a good man who has helped you out of your troubles; if you have promised him a bride for the service your word must be kept”\n\nIt was a pity the man’s face was covered with dirt and hair, else one would have seen how glad at heart these words made him. Bearskin took a ring off his finger, broke it in two, and, giving the youngest daughter one half, he kept the other for himself. On her half he wrote his name, and on his own he wrote hers, and begged her to preserve it carefully. Thereupon he left, saying, “For three years longer I must wander about; if I come back again, then we will celebrate our wedding; but if I do not, you are free, for I shall be dead. But pray to God that he will preserve my life.”\n\nWhen he was gone the poor bride clothed herself in black, and whenever she thought of her bridegroom burst into tears. From her sisters she received nothing but scorn and mocking. “Pay great attention when he shakes your hand,” said the eldest, “and you will see his beautiful claws!”\n\n“Take care!” said the second, “bears are fond of sweets, and if you please him he will eat you up, perhaps!” “You must mind and do his will,” continued the eldest, “or he will begin growling!” And the second daughter said further, “But the wedding will certainly be merry, for bears dance well!” The bride kept silence, and would not be drawn from her purpose by all these taunts; and meanwhile\n\nBearskin wandered about in the world, doing good where he could, and giving generously to the poor, for which they prayed heartily for him. At length the last day of the seven years approached, and Bearskin went and sat down again on the heath beneath the circle of trees. In a very short time the wind whistled, and the Evil One presently stood before him and looked at him with an angry face. He threw the Soldier his old coat and demanded his gray one back. “We have not got so far as that yet,” replied Bearskin; “you must clean me first.” Then the Evil One had, whether he liked it or no, to fetch water, wash the old Soldier, comb his hair out, and cut his nails. This done, he appeared again like a brave warrior, and indeed was much more handsome than before.\n\nAs soon as the Evil One had disappeared, Bearskin became quite light-hearted; and going into the nearest town he bought a fine velvet coat, and hired a carriage drawn by four white horses, in which he was driven to the house of his bride. Nobody knew him; the father took him for some celebrated general, and led him into the room where his daughters were.\n\nHe was asked to sit down between the two eldest, and they offered him wine, and heaped his plate with the most delicious food; for they thought they had never seen any one so handsome before. But the bride sat opposite to him dressed in black, neither opening her eyes nor speaking a word.\n\nAt length the Soldier asked the father if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, and immediately the two elder sisters arose, and ran to their chambers to dress themselves out in their best clothes, for each thought she should be chosen.\n\nMeanwhile the stranger, as soon as he found himself alone with his bride, pulled out the half of the ring and threw it into a cup of wine, which he handed across the table. She took it, and as soon as she had drunk it and seen the half ring lying at the bottom her heart beat rapidly, and she produced the other half, which she wore round her neck on a chain.\n\nShe held them together, and they joined each other exactly, and the stranger said, “I am your bridegroom, whom you first saw as Bearskin; but through God’s mercy I have regained my human form, and am myself once more.” With these words he embraced and kissed her; and at the same time the two eldest sisters entered in full costume. As soon as they saw that the very handsome man had fallen to the share of their youngest sister, and heard that he was the same as “Bearskin,” they ran out of the house full of jealousy.\n\nThe happy couple sat down and planned their wedding, which took place with great enjoyment the following month. At this stage the jealous sisters had calmed down and even agreed to be bridesmaids for the occasion!"

Time was of the essence and my plan included a quick turnaround trip from and back to the airport.\n\nA spotless cab pulled up. The driver rushed to open the passenger door for me and made sure I was comfortably seated before he closed the door. As he got in the driver’s seat, he mentioned that the neatly folded Wall Street Journal next to me was for my use. He then showed me several tapes and asked me what type of music I would enjoy.\n\nWell! I looked around for a “Candid Camera!” Wouldn’t you? I could not believe the service I was receiving! I took the opportunity to say, “Obviously you take great pride in your work. You must have a story to tell.”\n\n“You bet,” he replied, “I used to be in Corporate America. But I got tired of thinking my best would never be good enough. I decided to find my niche in life where I could feel proud of being the best I could be. I knew I would never be a rocket scientist, but I love driving cars, being of service and feeling like I have done a full day’s work and done it well. I evaluate my personal assets and… wham! I became a cab driver. One thing I know for sure, to be good in my business I could simply just meet the expectations of my passengers. But, to be GREAT in my business, I have to EXCEED the customer’s expectations!

She then put the shark on one side of the fiberglass and a new set of bait fish on the other.\n\nAgain, the shark quickly attacked.  This time, however, the shark slammed into the fiberglass divider and bounced off.  Undeterred, the shark kept repeating this behavior every few minutes to no avail.  Meanwhile, the bait fish swam around unharmed in the second partition.  Eventually, about an hour into the experiment, the shark gave up.\n\nThis experiment was repeated several dozen times over the next few weeks.  Each time, the shark got less aggressive and made fewer attempts to attack the bait fish, until eventually the shark got tired of hitting the fiberglass divider and simply stopped attacking altogether.\n\nThe marine biologist then removed the fiberglass divider, but the shark didn’t attack.  The shark was trained to believe a barrier existed between it and the bait fish, so the bait fish swam wherever they wished, free from harm.\n\nThe moral:  Many of us, after experiencing setbacks and failures, emotionally give up and stop trying. Like the shark in the story, we believe that because we were unsuccessful in the past, we will always be unsuccessful. In other words, we continue to see a barrier in our heads, even when no ‘real’ barrier exists between where we are and where we want to go."
