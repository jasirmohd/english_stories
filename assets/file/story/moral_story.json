      "body": "One hot day, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water.\n\nShe could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She was safe at last.\n\nJust at that time, a hunter nearby was about to throw his net over the dove, hoping to trap it.\n\nGuessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to safety.\n\nOne good turn begets another. "

      "title": "The Apple Tree and the Farmer",
      "body": "Once upon a time, there lived a farmer in a village, beside a forest. He had a big garden that had an old apple tree and other plants, trees and beautiful flowers. When the farmer was a little boy, he spent much of his time playing with the apple tree. Those days, the apple tree had given the choicest of apples to him. However, as time passed, the apple tree became old and stopped bearing fruits.\n\nNow that the farmer was not getting any apples from the tree, he decided that the tree was useless. Therefore, he decided to cut the tree and use its wood to make some new furniture. He felt that since the tree was old and huge, he did not have to cure it, and it would make great furniture. He forgot that as a boy, he had spent his entire childhood climbing the tree and eating its apples.\n\nNow the apple tree was home to several little animals in the neighborhood. This included squirrels, sparrows and a huge variety of birds and insects. When the farmer took his axe and began chopping the tree, all the little animals came rushing down.\n\nThey all began to plead with the farmer. They gathered round the farmer and said, \"Please don't cut the tree. We used to play with you when you were small, under this very tree. This is our home and we have no other place to go\".\n\nThe farmer was adamant. He raised his axe and the commotion grew.\n\n\"Please don't chop and destroy my home and kids,\" cried the squirrel.\n\n\"Please don't chop and destroy my nest,\" cried the little birds.\n\n\"Please don't cut the apple tree,\" cried the grasshopper.\n\nThe farmer, however, forgot his childhood and his animal friends. He began to chop the tree harder. All the little animals became desperate, and wanted to protect the apple tree at any cost.\n\nThe little animals said, \"We will sing for you when you are toiling away in the fields. We will look after your little boy. He will not cry, but instead will be entertained and happy. You will like our songs and will not feel tired.\"\n\nHowever, their cries for help fell on deaf ears. Despite all their requests, the farmer continued to chop down the tree.\n\nAll of a sudden, he noticed something shiny. On inspecting it, he realized that it was a beehive, full of honey. He took a little and put it in his mouth. The taste of the honey woke up the little boy in him. Suddenly, the memories of his childhood came rushing back. The honey tasted so good that he wanted more. It brought a sense of happiness to him. He smiled and exclaimed, \"This tastes amazing.\"\n\nRealizing the change in the farmer's attitude, the little animals spoke in unison: The bee said, \"I will always provide you with sweet honey.\" The squirrel said, \"I will share any amount of nuts that you want.\" The birds cried, \"We will sing as many songs as you want.\"\n\nFinally, the farmer realized his folly, and put down his axe. He understood that the tree was home to many lovely animals that provided him with so many things. He wanted his little boy to have the childhood that he had.\n\nThe farmer realized that the apple tree was not that fruitless. The little boy in him saved the apple tree.\n\nHe threw away the axe and said to the little creatures, \"I promise that I would never cut this tree. I have realized my mistake and you all can now live in peace and harmony.\"\n\nThe little creatures thanked the bee profusely. If the farmer had not found the beehive, they would have been homeless by now. They continued living happily in the old apple tree.\n\nMoral: Each and every living thing in nature is of some use: we should not destroy any living thing."

      "body": "One afternoon, a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from a lofty branch. \"Just the thing to quench my thirst,\" said the fox.\n\nTaking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again, the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them, but still failed.\n\nShort StoriesFinally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, \"They're probably sour anyway.\" Then he walked away.\n\nMORAL: IT'S EASY TO DESPISE WHAT YOU CANNOT HAVE.\n\nA note about the story\nThe 'Fox and the Grapes' is often cited as an example for cognitive dissonance: the discomfort people experience when their beliefs/actions are at odds with other beliefs/actions. In the story, the fox sees some grapes on a vine and wants to eat them. He tries to jump up, but cannot reach them because they are too high. When he realizes he will not be able to eat any grapes, the fox becomes disdainful; he tells himself that those grapes were sour and not worthy of desire anyway.\n\nPsychologist and teacher Leon Festinger pointed out in 1957, that often, people hold two conflicting beliefs, or they believe one thing but do something that is against that belief. The resulting cognitive dissonance is psychologically distressful, and we often try to alleviate it by justifying our actions or changing our beliefs. Either way, the goal is to get our beliefs and actions in line with each other."

To her surprise and disappointment, the fox said that he could not make a big feast as promised, and just offered some soup. When he brought the soup out of the kitchen, the stork saw that it was in a shallow bowl!\n\nThe poor stork could not have any soup with its long bill, but the fox easily licked the soup from the plate. As the stork just touched the soup with the tip of its bill, the fox asked her, \"How is the soup? Don't you like it?\"\n\nThe hungry stork replied, \"Oh it is good, but my stomach is upset, and I can't take any more soup!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for troubling you,\" said the fox.\n\nThe stork replied, \"Oh dear, please don't say sorry. I have some health problem and cannot enjoy what you offer.\"\n\nShe left the place after thanking the fox, and inviting him to her house for dinner.\n\nCunning Fox and the Clever Stork StoryThe day arrived and the fox reached the stork's place. After exchanging pleasantries, the stork served soup for both of them, in a narrow jar with a long neck. She was able to have the soup very easily with her long bill, but the fox obviously could not.\n\nAfter finishing hers, the stork asked the fox if he was enjoying the soup. The fox remembered the feast he himself had given the stork, and felt very ashamed. He stammered, \"I...I'd better leave now.

Also, he never wished to share anything with others. He paid very low wages to his servants.\n\nHowever, one day, he learned a lesson that changed his life forever.\n\nIt so happened that one day, a small bag that belonged to Sam was missing. The bag had 50 gold coins in it. Sam searched high and low for the bag, but could not find it. Sam's friends and neighbours also joined in the search, but all their efforts were in vain.\n\nAfter a couple of days, the ten year old daughter of a man working for Sam found the bag. She told her father about it. Her father identified the bag as the one that was missing, and immediately decided to take it to his master.\n\nHe gave the bag back to his master Sam, and asked him to check whether the bag had 50 gold coins. Sam was exultant to get the coins back, but he decided to play a trick. He shouted at his worker, \"there were 75 gold coins in this bag but you gave me only 50! Where are the other coins? You have stolen them!\"\n\nThe worker was shocked to hear this and pleaded his innocence. Selfish and greedy, Sam did not accept the worker's story, and decided to take the issue to court.\n\nThe judge heard both the sides. He questioned the daughter and the worker about the number of coins they had found in the bag, and they assured it was only 50.\n\nHe cross-examined Sam and Sam replied, \"Yes my lord, I had 75 gold coins in my bag, and they gave me only 50. Hence, it is quite obvious that they have stolen 25 coins!\"\n\nThe judge then asked, \"Are you sure that your bag had 75 coins?\"\n\nSam nodded vigorously.\n\nThe judge then made his judgment.\n\n\"Since Sam lost a bag of 75 gold coins and the bag found by the girl had only 50 coins, it is obvious that the bag that was found does not belong to Sam. It was lost by someone else. If anyone finds a bag of 75 gold coins, I will declare that it belongs to Sam. As there are no complaints about the loss of 50 coins, I order the girl and his father to take those 50 coins as a token of appreciation for their honesty!\"\n\nHonesty will always be rewarded and greed punished!"

It meant that the butterfly was trying to make its way out to enjoy the world. He decided to watch how the butterfly would come out of the cocoon. He was watching the butterfly struggling to break the shell for several hours. He spent almost more than 10 hours with the cocoon and the butterfly.

Unfortunately, neither did the wings expand nor the swollen body reduce.\n\nUnfortunately, the butterfly just crawled around with withered wings and a huge body. It was never able to fly. Although the man did it with a good intention, he did not know that only by going through struggles the butterfly can emerge to be beautiful, with strong wings.\n\nThe continuous effort from the butterfly to come out of its cocoon would let the fluid stored in the body be converted into wings. Thus, the body would become lighter and smaller, and the wings would be beautiful and large.\n\nIf we don't want to undergo any struggle, we won't be able to fly!\n\nStruggles make us shine!"

So while waiting he thought of having breakfast.\n\nHe went out of station and started walking toward a near by hotel to eat. On his way he saw two kids sitting on sidewalk. There condition was not looking good and by look on their face he could guess that they were very hungry.\n\nHe felt bad for them and gave them 10r and left. After this, as he was walking toward hotel he thought to himself, “How stupid of me..!! I gave them just 10rs.. What can they buy to eat with it, When i can’t even get a cup of tea with 10rs.”\n\nHe felt ashamed of himself and went back to those kids. He asked them if they would like to eat at hotel with him.\n\nKids were confused and looked at each other. As they were very hungry, they accepted his offer. When kids were at the hotel, Hotelier stopped them from entering as their clothes were too dirty and torn.\n\nSeeing this Rohit went to him and asked him to allow those kids to enter as they were with him and he is going to pay for their food. Seeing this Hotelier understood whole situation and felt ashamed at his act of stopping those kids from entering.\n\nThey got inside and got seated comfortably. After this Rohit asked kids, “What do you want to eat.” Kids kept silent. Rohit ordered food.\n\nAs soon as food came, he saw smile on face of boys and felt happy. When the children started eating, the happiness of their face was somewhat different.\n\nAfter having food. They returned back. Before leaving Rohit handed them some more money and asked them to buy some clothes.\n\nWhole incident was over. Rohit was back to his normal routine but even after many days he couldn’t stop thinking about those boys and felt bad for them. One day while visiting temple he said, “God, Where are you?? How can you sit quietly when there are children like them who are suffering from hunger..”\n\nJust in next moment a thought struck his mind, “Who had been providing food for them until now?? What i did for those boys, could i have done that with my own thinking??”\n\nAt that moment he realized and understood that ever we do is just a part of God’s Plan. Whenever we Help someone it’s because God find us worthy to help someone, he send us to help that person.\n\nMoral:\nRefusing to Help Someone is like Refusing Work of God. If you see Someone in Need of help and You can Help that Person According to Your Capability as No Help is Small for Person who Needs it."

Krishna understood.\n\nKrishna said to Arjuna, “When you were asked to distribute gold, you were deciding about requirement of each villagers need of gold. You were doing it knowing that it’s charity.\n\nWhere as Karna just gave away all the gold and left. He didn’t even waited for people to praise or cheer him.

So he decided that if Nanak ji was to learn anyway to earn money, it can be done through trading.\n\nSo one day, Guru Nanak’s father gave Bhai Bala twenty rupees and said, “Go with Nanak and buy some good from market and them sell them at profitable rate.”\n\nSo Bhai Bala and Nanak went to market to buy some goods. As they had passed ten miles from their village, they come across a group of Hermits who were sitting under a tree.\n\nSeeing them Nanak ji stopped Bhai Bala and said, “Father asked us to make some profitable transaction and nothing can be more profitable than to feed these Hermits.\n\nI can’t go forward leaving such great opportunity to make true profitable transaction.”\n\nNanak ji took all the money from Bhai Bala and offered that money to them saying, “I offer this in your service..”\n\nHead of that Hermit group replied, “Son, this money is of no use for us as we never go to any village or town.\n\nWe always stay here in jungle.. If you offer us a meal, we will accept it..”\n\nThen Nanak ji and Bhai Bala went to near by village to get meals for hermits and with remaining money he purchased clothes for hermits.

Everyone was happy as they were able to complete task given to them of stealing rice from home without anyone noticing them.\n\nRamakrishna asked that student reason for coming empty handed.\n\nStudent told him that even if he tries hard to steal rice hiding from everyone else, he always saw himself stealing rice.\n\nSo there was never ever a situation when he could have steal rice when nobody is seeing..\n\nBecause what ever we do, it is never hidden from one person and that is our-self.\n\nThat student who came empty handed was Swami Vivekananda.\n\nMoral:\nWhenever we try to do Something Wrong, even if we hide it from Everyone Else yet we can’t Hide it from our-self. So we should Never do anything Wrong.\n\n\nStory 2: Swami Vivekananda in Class..!!\n\nOnce while in school, recess time Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) was talking to his friends and everyone was listening to him so attentively that they were not aware of what’s happening around them.\n\nMeanwhile recess ended and teacher entered class and started teaching his subject to class.

Narendra answered each question correctly.\n\nTeacher inquired about who was the one student talking to others and kept them involved in talks even during class.\n\nEveryone in class pointed toward Narendranath but teacher refused to believe as he was only one who answered everything correctly. Teacher thought everyone was lying.\n\nSo he punished whole class and asked them to stand on bench as punishment except for Narendra. Yet Narendra joined his friend and stood up on the bench with other students.\n\nTeacher asked him to come down and sit on his seat but Narendra replied, “No Sir..

I noticed that you have been answering all people from last two days and night and haven’t even taken a drop of water. This has pained me very much..”\n\nSwami ji felt that in form of poor man, God had appeared before him and said, “Will you please give me something to eat??”\n\nPoor man was a cobbler by profession and traditionally a person from lower caste were even forbid from coming near to Brahman or Sanyasi. So poor man hesitatingly asked, “Swami ji.. I want to bake and bring some bread for you but I am from lower caste.. How can you eat it if i have already touched it..”\n\nPoor man asked, “Swami ji if you allow then i can bring you some ingredient to make food and then you can prepare them as you please..!!”\n\nSwami ji replied, “No.. I shall be happy to eat whatever you bring for me to eat..”\n\nPoor man was frightened and feared that people for higher caste might punish him for giving food to Sanyasi but he wanted to serve to Swami ji and hurriedly went back home and came back with some freshly baked bread..”\n\nSwami ji was moved by the kindness and selfless love of poor man. Swami ji ate that bread and thanked poor man for his kindness.\n\nIn meantime some high caste gentleman found that a lower class man had offered food to Swami ji and was accepted by him.\n\nThey went to Swami ji and questioned about it and said that it was wrong of him to accept that food.\n\nSwami ji listened to them patiently and replied, “You people made me talk without respite for the past three days but you did not even care to inquire if I had taken any food and rest.\n\nYou claim you are gentlemen and boast of your high caste..!! what is more shameful, you condemn this man for being of a low caste. Can you overlook the humanity he has just shown and despise him without feeling ashamed?”\n\nGentlemen felt ashamed about their behavior."

She kept all those bowls in front of her daughter and asked, “Tell me.. What do you see??”\n\nDaughter replied, “Carrot, eggs and coffee.” Mother moved bowl of carrot toward her daughter and asked to touch and feel texture of carrot.\n\nDaughter did same and replied, “It’s soft.”\n\nNow mother moved bowl of eggs toward her and asked her to break the egg.\n\nDaughter did same and replied, “It’s hard..”\n\nFinally mother asked daughter to drink a sip of coffee. After drinking coffee she tasted it’s rich aroma.\n\nDaughter looked at her mother and questioned, “What does it mean??”\n\nHer mother explained, “Each of these objects faced same adversity but reacted differently. As you can see carrot was hard and strong but after being subjected to boiling water, it became softened and weak.\n\nEggs which were fragile, after getting boiled it became hardened. At last, coffee which we added to boiling water, changed water..”\n\nAfter explaining this, mother asked her daughter, “Which are you? When you face adversity in life, how will you respond?\n\nAre you going to lose your strength after facing adversity or you would be like egg hard and tougher. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst.. you get better and change the situation around you.\n\nWhen the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate to another level? How do you handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?”"

There is only one set of foot prints on beach..\n\nI don’t understand why you would leave me alone.. when i needed you the most..”\n\nGod smiled and replied,”My precious.. you are my child and i would never leave you alone.\n\nDuring your times of suffering and difficulties where you see only one set of foot print, those were the time when i carried you in my arms..”\n\nMoral:\nWhenever you face Difficulty in Life, Trust in God. Don’t Lose Hope and Even if No one stands with You, God is Always there for you, Taking Care of You."

      "body": "Story 1: Buddha’s Plough and Sow..!!\n\nOne day while a farmer was on the field getting his harvest ready to take to market, just then Buddha came by and stood in front of him holding a bowl in his hand.. begging for alms.\n\nSeeing this farmer got angry and said, “I worked in fields, i ploughed and sow and there for i eat. It would be better if you were in like manner to plough and to sow, and then you would have food enough to eat without begging.”\n\n\nBuddha smile and replied, “Don’t get angry.. I plough and sow too.. and having ploughed and sown, I eat.”\n\nFarmer replied, “If it’s true then where are your bullocks and seed?? Where is your plough?? I see no sign of it..!!”\n\nBuddha answered, “Faith is the seed I sow and good works are the rain that fertilizes it. Wisdom and good works are the parts of the plough, and my mind is the guiding rein. I lay hold of the handle of the Law; earnestness is the goad I use and diligence is my daughter. Thus my ploughing is done, destroying the weeds of delusion. The harvest that it yields is the ambrosia-fruit of Nirvana, and by this ploughing all sorrow ends.”\n\n\nStory 2: Sacrificing Innocent Creature..!!\n\nOne day a man was preparing for sacrifice in honor of God. Whole lot of goats and sheep were bought together to be slaughtered. When the day of sacrifice came, Buddha visited man and they discussed many thing.\n\nAt last Buddha spoke about sacredness of all life, whether it’s of man or animal.\n\nBuddha said, “One cannot get rid of his sins and delusions by making innocent creatures suffer.. For nothing but his own unbroken efforts after right doing and right thinking can avail a man..”\n\nBuddha’s word sank deep into man’s soul and he understood that, “Pure heart and upright ways which are of far higher value than a sacrifice necessitating the shedding of blood.”\n\nMan decided that all those animals should be given freedom and instead f being slaughter they should be left free to live their lives at their own will.\n"

      "title": "Old Man’s Reply",
      "body": "Once there was an poor old man used to live in a village. He was poor yet even king’s were jealous of him because of a beautiful white horse he owned.\n\nHe was offered fabulous prices and money to sell that horse but old man would refuse saying, “This is not just horse to me, he is a person and a friend.. can you sell a person or a friend?? No.. it’s not possible.”\n\nOne day in morning when he went to stable he saw that horse was not there. News spread in the village and whole village gathered at his house.\n\nThey said, “You are foolish old man.. Everyone wanted that horse, Everyone knew that someday it would be stolen. You could have sell that horse for any price but yet you kept it. Now horse it gone, what a misfortune..!!”\n\nOld man replied, “Fact is that horse is not in stable, everything else you say is a judgement. How do you know whether it’s a misfortune or not?”\n\nPeople replied, “Don’t fool us.. A treasure has been lost, it’s a misfortune.”\n\nOld man replied, “I just know that stable is empty and anything else i don’t know because this is just a fragment. Who knows what’s going to follow..”\n\nPeople laughed at him and left. They said that he was crazy. He could have sell that horse and live a better life rather than living in misery and poverty. Now even that horse is stolen and he lost all hope of getting wealthy.\n\nAfter few days horse came back from wilderness and with him came more horse of same breed.\n\nPeople around village gathered again and said, “Old man, you were right. We are sorry for our judgement. You were right it wasn’t a misfortune but a blessing. Now, you have more beautiful horses. You can train them and sell them to earn money.”\n\nOld man replied, “Again you are going too far. Just say that the horse is back and say that it’s a blessing to have more horses — but don’t judge. Who knows whether it is a blessing or not? It is only a fragment. It will pass too.”\n\nThis time people kept silent.\n\nOld man’s only son started to train horses. Just few days later while training one of those wild horses old man’s son fell from the horse and his legs were broken.\n\nHearing this news people gathered and said, “You were right. Having more horses isn’t a blessing. Now your only son is injured because of this. In this old age what will you do with your crippled son..”\n\nOld man replied, “Don’t go that far. Say only that my son has broken his legs. Who knows whether this is a misfortune or a blessing? — nobody knows. Again a fragment, Life comes in fragments and judgment is about the total.”\n\nOne month later, all the young one’s of the village were forced to join military as war broke out. All the people in the village were crying.\n\nPeople came to old man and said, “Our son’s are gone for ever. Injury to your son proved to be blessing.. At least now he is alive living with you.”\n\nOld man replied, “Nobody knows! Only say that — our sons have been forced to enter into the army and your son has not been forced but no one knows whether it is a blessing or a misfortune. Nobody will ever be able to know it. Only God knows.”\n\nMoral:\nSimilar is our Life.. When ever Something Bad happen, with just that Fragment we come to Conclusion but we Never think that there are Things which are completely Beyond Us.\n\nWe should not Judge any Situation just by with what we See. We Never know what’s going to come Next."

Old lady acted out of pity toward that beggar.\n\nAfter that we saw a merchant noticed a small group of people who were talking about him so he gave 5 gold coins to beggar and left quickly. Merchant acted out of pride.

That little boy is the one who acted out of compassion”\n\nMaster continued and explained, “Compassion is far greater and nobler than pity.  Pity has its roots in fear. When fear touches someone’s pain it becomes pity But when love touches someone’s pain it becomes compassion.\n\nSo to understand compassion we should understand that all beings are same and suffer in similar way honor, We should honor all who suffer and know that we are neither separate nor superior to anyone.“"

I have nothing to offer…”\n\nWith this she remembered about her empty kitchen cabinets and reached for her purse to check for money. She saw that she had only 5 dollar.\n\nShe thought about things she could buy and hurried out of door. She went to market and bought a loaf of bread and carton of milk with some sliced turkey. She had only some cents left with her yet she was happy holding those meager offering tucked under her arm.\n\nOn her way back to home she heard a voice saying, “Lady, can you help us?” When she turned back she saw a man and woman in ragged clothes, were dirty and smelled bad.\n\nMan said, “Lady, i ain’t got a job and me and my wife have been living on streets and it’s getting cold and we have nothing to eat. We are really hungry. If you could help us we would really appreciate..”\n\nRose replied, “Sir, i would like to help but i am myself a poor woman and all i have is some bread and turkey cuts which i bought for an important guest coming tonight.”\n\n“Okay.. I can understand lady.. Thanks anyway.”, Man replied and hold hand of her wife and headed back to alley. As Rose watched them leave, she felt a little twinge in her heart. She turned back toward man and woman and said, “Sir.. wait..”\n\nCouple stopped. Rose ran towards them, handed them grocery bag and said, “Sir, take this food with you. I will figure something out to serve my guest.”\n\n“Thank you!! thank you!!”,said man’s wife. Rose saw that she was shivering from cold, seeing this Rose unbuttoned her coat and gave it to her and said, “You know, i have got another coat at home.. You take this one.”\n\nThen smiling she turned and walked back toward her home. She was shivering with cold and worried about not having anything to offer to Jesus after she reach home. When she reached home. She opened her door. As she entered she noticed another mail.\n\nShe took envelope and opened it.\n\nIt Read: Dear Rose, it was good to see you.. Thank you for the lovely meal and also for beautiful coat. Love Always.. Jesus.\n\nMoral:\nAlways Help others."

All these years we watched you praying. What do you talk to God about? What we should be praying for?”\n\nMan smiled and replied, “In beginning when i was young, i used to kneel before God and ask him to give me strength to change human kind. Gradually i realized that this was beyond me. Then i started to pray to God to give me strength to change world around me.”\n\n“Well, your wish to help people around you was granted as we know that you have helped many.”, said one of his friends.\n\nMan said, “Well, i have helped many but i knew i still haven’t found perfect prayer. Only now at this age I realized what i should have been praying about from the start..!!”\n\nFriends questioned, “What is that?”\n\n“To be given the ability to change myself..”, replied man with smile.\n\nMoral:\nWhen ever we feel troubled we think that We should try to change people and their attitude but What we need is to Understand that Sometimes Change need to Start with within ourselves."

There is no way to remove lemon juice from the water.\n\nSo what’s solution?\n\nThe only way to correct it was to add four more glasses of water to the already made lime water and dilute the lemon juice to make five glasses of fresh lime water.\n\nNow, if we think about life it’s same. Sometimes we do things which cannot be undone. Some wrong decisions, wrong choices, wrong doings, wrong actions can never be undone.\n\nSo what’s solution?\n\nWhen we cannot undo things and correct what ever wrong happened, we should not waste more time over it. It would be like trying to remove lemon juice from lime water. Instead, If things get wrong and cannot be undone then we should get busy in adding so many right things in our life that wrong seems insignificant.\n\nWe all have negative sides to ourselves and we may not be able to correct all our negativities but we can definitely try to continue adding positive thoughts, actions, people in our lives and dilute negativity.\n\nWe all have been through lows in our life and we cannot change that But if we add new highs in our life, we will be able to dilute lows. isn’t it?\n\nIn the end Life will seem “Mostly High”.

We should try to do a lot of good things and concentrate on making life more positive today so that we can dilute bad things which ever happened or done by us in past.\n\nMoral:\nEverything in your life will never be perfect.

But since you asked i will certainly tell you about three master..”\n\n# Among three of them One master was a Thief.\n\nOnce while wandering around in a desert i got lost and till i found a way and reached village it was too late. Everything was closed and there was no one outside.\n\nAt last i found a man who was trying to make hole in a wall. I went to ward him asked him if i could find a place to stay. He replied to that it will be difficult to find a place to stay at this time of night but you cans tay with me, if its ok with you to stay with a thief. I stayed with him for a month.\n\nEach night he would say me that, “I am going to work. You can rest and pray.”\nWhen he came back i would ask him, “Did you get anything today?”\nHe would reply, “No not tonight but tomorrow i will try again. God Willing.”\n\nEven after daily disappointment he never lost hope and he was always happy.\n\nWhen i was meditating for years and still nothing changed, many moments came where i would get so desperate and hopeless that i thought of leaving all this and then suddenly i would remember words of that thief that, “God willing, Tomorrow it is going to happen. ”\n\n# Second master was a Dog\n\nOnce i was going along side of a river, there i saw a dog who was very thirsty. I saw that as dog looked into river to drink water, it saw his own image and got afraid. Seeing his own reflection dog barked and ran away. But because dog was too thirsty he would come back. This happened many time but finally despite his fear, dog jumped into water.\n\nSeeing this i knew that it was a message from God. It means that one has to go forward despite all of his fears.\n\n# Third master was Little boy\n\nAs i entered a town i saw a little kid carrying a lit candle in his hands.\n\nI asked him, “Have you lit this candle yourself? ”\nHe replied, “Yes sir.”\nI said, “There was time when candle was not lit and when it was lit but can you show me the source from which light came?”\nBoy laughed and blew out the candle and said ,”You have seen light go? can you tell me where it had gone?? ”\nBoy continued, “Ok, i will tell you it had gone to the same place where it emerged. It had returned to the source.”\n\nThis shattered my ego and at that moment i felt how stupid i was. And since then i just dropped all my Knowledge-ability.\n\nI had no master but this doesn’t means that i was not a disciple.

When son opened it there were 4 pair of clothes for each season and some raw food, grains and some money and a map. As son was wondering his father said, “I want you to find a treasure.” And that map is of place where the treasure is hidden and you need to go and find it.\n\nNext day, son set out on his journey eager to find the mystery treasure.

One day, he wanted to get himself painted and made an announcement. After filtering the talented artists, the king asked three men to draw his face.\n\nHe told them, ‘If you do an impeccable job, I will reward you with something you won’t even earn in your life time! If not, you will be severely punished!’\n\nAll the three agreed and started to sketch his face.\n\nThe first artist showed the painted picture of the king. The king felt bad as the picture showed that one of the eyes was shown blind, though he drawn both eyes. The artist was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years.  The king felt that the picture was a dishonor to a ruler showing a physical disability!\n\nThe second artist showed the picture and even he was imprisoned for 5 years. The picture depicted the king having vision in both eyes. The king felt he was falsely praising the king to earn reward and it was also considered a matter of dishonoring the king pointing his blindness!\n\nThe third artist showed the picture and was rewarded a fortune! The third artist was very clever and he drawn the king’s face with only one eye!\n\nMoral:\nThere is Solution to Every Problem.. You Just Need to Think Hard"

He paid a very little amount of wages to his servants. Where ever he went, he calculated a lot to save money by deceiving others. He also told a lot of lies to protect his wealth. Simply, Rohan was the antonym for the word HONESTY.\n\nHowever, he was taught a nice lesson by his own act.\n\nOne day, he missed a small bag, which contained 50 gold coins. He was searching for the bag of gold coins day and night. He sent his workers in search of the bag, but none could find it. He told his friends and neighbors that he had lost a bag of gold coins and requested them to inform if they found it. Rohan was so sad that he had lost so many gold coins.\n\nAfter a couple of days, a ten year old girl, who was located near Rohan’s house, told her father that she had found a small bag and it had 50 gold coins. Her father worked in Rohan’s land. He told his daughter that it was his chief’s money and he had lost it before two days and added he would return the bag to his master. They weren’t very rich and the father could retain the gold coins with themselves and hide the fact of finding the bag.  He was so honest that he should return the valuable coins to his master, who really owed it.\n\nHe gave it back to his master Rohan and asked him to check whether the bag had 50 gold coins. Rohan who was literally happy to get the coins, decided to play a trick. He shouted at his worker, ‘There were 75 gold coins in this bag and you gave me only 50! Where are the other coins? You have stolen them!’\n\nThe worker was shocked to hear this and he pleaded to his master that he gave whatever his daughter had found. Selfish and greedy Rohan did not accept it and they decided to take the issue to court to get the right judgment. The judge heard both the sides. He examined the daughter and the worker about the number of coins they had found in the bag and they assured it was only 50!\n\nHe cross-examined Rohan and Rohan replied, ‘Yes lord, I had 75 gold coins in my bag and now they gave me only 50! They have stolen my 25 coins!’\nJudge asked, ‘Are you sure you had 75 coins?’ and Rohan nodded his head.\n\nThen the judge made his judgment, ‘Since Rohan lost a bag of 75 gold coins, the bag found by the girl which had only 50 coins doesn’t belong to Rohan and it was lost by somebody else. In addition, if anyone found a bag of 75 gold coins, I would declare it belongs to Rohan. Also, there were no claims against the loss of 50 coins and I order the girl and his father to take those 50 coins as a token of appreciation for their honesty!’\n\nMoral:\nHonesty is rewarded and greediness is punished!"

She took that bowl and went to the tiger’s cave on mountain side.\n\nShe was scared to go anywhere near the cave but still took that bowl and silently placed it in front of cave and then carefully backed down.\n\nNext day again she went there with a rice of bowl with meat sauce on the top. When she reached there, she saw empty bowl. She replaced that empty bowl with filled one and tried to leave silently as she didn’t wanted to attract the wild beast attention.\n\nThis went on for months yet she never saw tiger but from the footprints she could guess that animal eating all the food must be tiger.\n\nOne day as she approached, she noticed tiger’s head poking out of cave. Very carefully she set down the fresh rice bowl on the same spot replacing empty one and stepped back.\n\nAfter few weeks she noticed that tiger would come out of cave, when she came to replace empty rice bowl with fresh one. She stayed away from tiger but in her heart she knew that one day she have to come closer to get it’s whisker.\n\nAnother month went by and now tiger would sat beside empty bowl waiting for her to come. As she looked at tiger carefully, she felt it’s rather friendly creature. Not a week later, tiger allowed her to gently rub it’s head and as she rubbed it’s head, tiger would purr and stretch like a house cat.\n\nShe went back home and that night she knew that time had come. Next morning she brought a knife and also took a fresh bowl of rice to tiger’s cave. She placed the rice bowl and said to tiger, “May i please have just one of your whiskers??”\n\nTiger nodded and while petting its head, she carved whisker off tiger’s head. She thanked tiger and left.\n\nNext day she went to hermit’s hut with the precious whisker in her fist. She said, “I have the whisker.. Live tiger’s whisker you needed for making potion..”\n\nHermit was surprised and said, “Really?? from live tiger??”\nKim replied, “Yes..”\n\nHermit checked the whisker, it was indeed tiger’s whisker. “Tell me.. how did you do it??”, said hermit.\n\nKim told him about the story that how she earned tiger’s trust and when she requested, tiger permitted her to cut off one off it’s whisker.\n\nAfter listening to Kim story, hermit took the whisker and flicked it into fire and said, “Kim.. you no longer need the whisker.. Tell me, what’s more vicious.. A tiger or a man?? If a dangerous wild beat respond to you gradual patient care.. don’t you think a man will respond??”\n\nKim stood speechless and then returned to her.. Now she knew what she could do to get her husband back.\n\nMoral:\nWith Patience, Love and Care you can Won anyone’s heart."

      "body": "Once an eight year old boy Tom was playing in park, climbing tree and hanging around. While playing he got on top of 30 feet high tree, hanging on one of its branch and swinging back and forth. Boy was having fun and didn’t realize that branch could break.\n\nHis cousin Jim, who was just year older than him was playing on same tree. He was hanging just 10 feet below branch of that tree.\n\nTom father and Jim mother noticed that kids were up high on that tree and they could fall. Before they could get kids back, suddenly a gust of wind came over the tree and tree started to sway.\n\nTom could hear voice of his father saying, “Tom, hold on tightly.”\n\nOn the Other side Jim’s mother was saying, “Jim, Don’t fall..!!”\n\nJust in that moment they saw that Jim had fallen out of that tree and was little hurt. Tom scampered down the tree to safety.\n\nAfter getting home, Jim’s mother asked Tom’s dad, “Tom and Jim both were hanging from same tree but still  Jim fell from that tree and Tom didn’t. How?”\n\nTom’s father explained to her, “When gust of wind came, you yelled out  ‘Jim don’t fall’ and that’s why he did fell.”\n\nHe explained further, “Mind have a very difficulty time processing negative image. In order for Jim to process the command of not falling, he first had to image falling and then try to tell brain not to fall, when tom was told to hold on tightly he had an instant image of him hanging on tightly.”\n\nJim’s mother now understood the difference.\n\nMoral:\nUsing Positive Words will have better Results that using negative words. To Break out of Bad Habit we Need to develop Good Habit and Automatically things will start to get Better and We will feel Positive."

All disciples sitting there started to read and learn that lesson.\n\nAfter a while sky got cloudy and it looked like it will start to rain.\n\nSeeing this one of the disciple said, “It seems like it is going to rain today.”\n\nListening to him second disciple responded and said, “You shouldn’t have said anything as master has asked us to stay silent till he come back and now you have disobeyed him.”\n\nThird disciple said to second one, “See, now even you are speaking..!”\n\nThose three disciples spoke in master’s absence but fourth disciple still didn’t said anything and silently kept studying that lesson.\n\nAfter an hour master came back.\n\nAs soon as disciples saw master, pointing toward second disciple first one complained, “Master, he spoke in you absence.”\n\nSecond one said, “So what?? even you didn’t kept quiet..”\n\nThird said, “Master, they both disobeyed you..”\n\nJust then first one said, “Who are you to say so?

      "body": "Long-era ago, In India lived a boy named Eklavya, son of tribal chief in the forest of kingdom Hastinapur. Eklavya was brave and handsome boy who was loved by all. His father saw that something was troubling him. Many times he saw his son lost in deep thought and other boys used to play and hunt for pleasure.\n\nOne day father asked his son, “Why are you so unhappy? Why don’t you play with your friends?”\n\n“I want to be a Archer. I want to be a disciple of the great guru Dronacharya, the greatest tutor of Archery in Hastinapur. His Gurukul is a magical place where ordinary boys are turned into mighty warriors.”, He replied. “I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, but I want to be a warrior, father, not a mere hunter. So please allow me to leave home and become the disciple of Dronacharya.”, He added\n\nHis father knew it not going to be easy for him but he didnot want to refuse the only wish of his son. So, father gave his blessings. Eklavya set on his way to reach part of forest where drona taught the princes of Hastinapur.\n\nWhen boy reached Drona’s gurukul and saw it was consisted of several huts surrounded by treesand an archery yard. There he saw a man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy. Though Eklavya had never seen Drona before, he put his guess at work. He went near Drona and bowed. The sage was surprised to see a strange boy addressing him. Who are you? he asked.\n\n“Dronacharya, I am Eklavya, son of the Tribal Chief in the western part of the forests of Hastinapura.” Eklavya replied. “Please accept me as your disciple and teach me the wonderful art of Archery.”\n\nDrona sighed. “Eklavya… if you are a tribal hunter, you must be a Shudra, the lowest social community according to the Vedic Caste System. I am a Brahmin, the highest caste in the kingdom. I cannot teach a Shudra boy” he said.\n\nThe innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt by Drona’s refusal to teach him. “It’s not fair!” he thought miserably. “God has given knowledge to all, but man alone differentiates his kind.” He left the place with a broken heart But it could not shatter his ambition to learn Archery. He was still as determined to learn Archery.\n\n“I may be a Shudra but does it make any difference?” thought he. “I am as strong and zealous as Drona’s princes and disciples. If I practice the art everyday, I can surely become an archer.”\n\nEklavya reached his own forests and took some mud from a nearby river. He made a statue of Dronacharya and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. Eklavya did this because he faithfully believed that if he practiced before his Guru, he would become an able archer. Thus, though his Guru shunned him, he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his Guru.\n\nDay after day, he took his bow and arrow, worshiped the statue of Drona and started practice. In time faith, courage and perseverance transformed Eklavya the mere tribal hunter into Eklavya the extraordinary archer.\n\nOne day while Eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first the boy ignored the dog, but continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking. Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, Eklavya fired several arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog’s mouth without injuring it. As a result it roamed the forests with its mouth opened.\n\nAs fate would have it, that day, Drona was instructing prince about some finer points of archery by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle. As they were busy practicing, they suddenly chanced upon the “stuffed” dog, and wonder who could have pulled off such a feat of archery. Drona was amazed too.” Such an excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer.” he exclaimed.\n\nHe told the Pandavas that if somebody was such a good archer then he surely needed to be met. The practice was stopped and together they began searching the forest for the one behind such amazing feat. They found a dark-skinned man dressed all in black, his body besmeared with filth and his hair in matted locks. It was Eklavya. Dronacharya went up to him.\n\nDrona said,”Your aim is truly remarkable! From whom did you learn Archery?” Eklavya was thrilled to hear Drona’s praises. How surprised he will be if he told Drona that he, in fact was his Guru! “From you my Master. You are my Guru,” Eklavya replied humbly.\n\n“Your Guru? How can I be your Guru? I have never seen you before!” Drona exclaimed in surprise. But all of a sudden he remembered something. He remembered about an eager boy who had visited his Gurukul several months ago. ” Now I remember,” said he. “Are you not the same hunter boy whom I refused admission in my Gurukul some months back?”\n\n“Yes, Dronacharya”, replied the boy. “After I left your Gurukul, I came home and made a statue like you and worshiped it every day. I practiced before your image. You refused to teach me, but your statue did not. Thanks to it, I have become a good archer.”\n\nHearing this, Arjuna became angry. “But you promised me that you’d make me the best archer in the world!” he accused Drona. “Now how can that be? Now a common hunter has become better than me!”\nThe other princes remembered their master frequently praising Arjuna that he had immense talent and will be the greatest archer in the kingdom. They waited with bated breath. What will their teacher do now?\n\nUnable to answer Arjuna’s question, Drona remained silent. The sage too was upset that his promise to Prince Arjuna was not going to be fulfilled. He was also angry with Eklavya for disobeying him. So the sage planned to punish Eklavya.\n\n“Where is your guru dakhsina? You have to give me a gift for your training,” the sage demanded. He had finally found a way to make Eklavya suffer for his disobedience.\n\nEklavya was overjoyed. A guru dakshina is the final offering from a student to the guru before leaving the ashram. The teacher may ask for something or nothing at all.\n\n“Dronacharya, I’ll be the happiest person on earth to serve you. Ask me anything and I will offer it to you as my guru dhakshina “he said. “I might ask something you don’t like to give me. What if you refuse the dhakshina I want?” Drona asked cunningly.\n\nEklavya was shocked. It was considered a grave insult and a great sin if a guru’s dakshina was refused. “No! How can I, teacher? I am not that ungrateful. I’ll never refuse anything you ask, Dronacharya,” promised the unsuspecting boy.\n\nDrona did not wait anymore. “Eklavya, I seek to have your right-hand thumb as my guru dhakshina” he declared. Silence befell on everyone. Everyone was shocked, even Arjuna. He looked at his teacher in horror and disbelief. How could their teacher make such a cruel demand? That too, from a mere boy?\n\nFor a moment Eklavya stood silent. Without his thumb he could never shoot arrows again. But the teacher must be satisfied. “Ok Gurudev, as you wish.” said he. Then, without the slightest hesitation, Eklavya drew out his knife and cut his thumb!\n\nThe princes gasped at Eklavya’s act of bravery. But the tribal boy betrayed no signs of pain, and held out his severed thumb to Dronacharya.\n\n“Here is my guru dakshina, Drona”, Ekalavya said. “I am happy that you have made me your disciple, even if I’m a mere Shudra hunter.”\n\nThe sage was humbled. He blessed the young archer for his courage. “Eklavya, even with out your thumb, you’ll be known as a great archer. I bless you that you will be remembered forever for your loyalty to your guru,” Drona declared and left the forests. He was moved and grieved at his own action. But he was content that his promise to Arjuna was not broken. The Gods blessed Eklavya from above.\n\nBut despite his handicap, Eklavya continued to practice archery. How could he do so? When one is dedicated, one can make even mountains bow. With practice, Eklavya could shoot arrows with his index and middle finger and he became a greater archer than he was ever before. His renown spread far and wide. When Drona came to know this, he blessed the boy silently and begged for divine forgiveness.\n\nAnd true to Drona’s blessing, Eklavya is still praised as the most loyal and brave student in the epic of Mahabharatha.\n\nMoral:\nWith your dedication and determination to learn something you can do anything you want..!!"

      "body": "It’s story of a young man name Monty who was a son of horse trainer who would go stables, race tracks, farms, training horses. As a result boy’s high school career was interrupted continuously.\n\nOne day at this school he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be in his life when he grew up. That night boy wrote a seven page paper describing his goal about owning a horse ranch.\n\nHe wrote his dream in detail and even drew diagram of 200-acre ranch and all things he was going to include in his ranch such as building, track etc. He drew detailed floor plan for everything he dreamed about owning one day.\n\nNext day he handed this project to his teacher. After two days he received his paper back with ‘F’ grade on top of it. Teacher asked him to meet her after class.\n\nAfter class boy went to meet teacher and asked, “Why did he got ‘F’?”\n\nTeacher said, “This dream is too unrealistic as you need lots of money to buy land, pay for horses and later other things to be paid for. You have no money. There is no way you can ever do it. Write more realistic goal and i will reconsider your grades.”\n\nThat day boy thought a lot about it and then went to his father about what to do. After listening to his problem his father replied, “Dear son, it your decision and you have to make up your mind about it as its important for you.”\n\nAfter a week when boy again submit the paper, he gave the same paper he gave before without making any change in it stating at end, “You can keep the ‘F’ and i will keep my dream.”\n\nYears after Same School teacher went on a field trip with 30 kids to camp on ranch for a week. It was a big Ranch with buildings and Track with big House. To the surprise it was same boy’s ranch to whom once she gave ‘F’ for that paper.\n\nBut realizing what she did back then before leaving the ranch she said, “Look Monty, I can tell you this now. When i was you teacher, i was dream stealer and i did that to lot of kids. Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up yours.”\n\nMoral:\nFollow your Heart, No matter What. No Dream is too Big or too small, when One work hard to live it."

      "body": "Once upon a time, there lived a very rich and wealthy man in a big town. He had all sorts of wealth and led a luxurious life. He had every luxury at his footstep and could afford to feed for the entire people of his town. He always boasted his luxurious life to his friends and relatives.\n\nHis son was studying in a distant place and he returned home for vacation. The rich man wanted to show off to his son how rich his father was and how he made him very proud. But his son wasn’t ever fond of any luxurious lifestyle. However, the rich man wanted to make his son realize that his lifestyle was extremely rich and how the poor people did suffer. He planned for a day visit to the entire town to show him off the life of the poor people.\n\nThe father and the son took a chariot and visited the entire town. They returned home after two days. The father was happy that his son was very quiet after seeing the poor people honoring the rich man and after seeing the sufferings of the poor ones due to lack of facilities.\n\nThe rich man asked his son, ‘Dear boy, how was the trip? Have you enjoyed it?’\n‘Yes my dad, it was a great trip with you.’ The son replied.\n\nSo, what did you learn from the trip? – The Father asked.\nThe son was silent.\n\nFinally you have realized how the poor suffer and how they actually are – said the father.\nNo father – replied the son.\n\nHe added, ‘We have only two dogs, they have 10 dogs. We have a big pool in our garden, but they have a massive bay without any ends! We have luxurious and expensive lights imported from various countries, but they have countless stars lighting their nights. We have a house in a small piece of land, but they have abundant fields that go beyond the sight. We are served by servants, but they serve people. We are protected by huge and strong walls around our property, but they bond with each other and surround themselves. We only buy food from them, but they are so rich to cultivate their own food.’\n\nThe rich father was stunned to hear his son’s words and he was completely speechless.\n\nFinally the son added, ‘Dad thank you so much for showing me who is rich and who is poor and let me understand how poor we are!’\n\nMoral:\nTrue wealth is not measured by money and property we have! It is in the friendship, relationship and good compassion we share with the others."

However he regretted one thing, it was the intolerable pain felt in his feet after such long trip he had been to for first time in his life.\n\nHe complained to his ministers that roads were not comfortable to walk. The path he walked all the way was stony and he couldn’t tolerate the pain he felt in his feet. King got worried about his people who used to walk on those roads. So, he ordered to cover the roads with leather so that people feel comfortable walking on roads. This thought of king was kind and for the betterment and happiness of the people.\n\nAs the ministers heard the order, they were stunned!! As this order would destroy the life of thousands of animals to get sufficient leather and also it would cost a huge amount of money also.\n\nA wise man from the ministry came to the king and said that he had another idea. King Asked his minister about the idea.\n\nSo Minister said ” Why do you want to kill so many animals to cover the road with leather? Rather, you can just have a piece of leather cut in appropriate shape to cover your feet? ”\n\nThe king was very much surprised by his suggestion and applauded the minister. He ordered for a pair of leather shoes for him and requested the countrymen to wear shoes.\n\nMoral:\nWe Curse And Blame the Things in Our Surroundings and Never Understand that We Need a Change in Us."
